I had the Samsung A600 for awhile which is absolute doo doo. You can read my review on it and detect my rage at the stupid thing. It finally died on me so I used this Nokia phone I bought in a garage sale for $1. I wonder y she sold it so cheap?... Bad: ===> I hate the menu. It takes forever to get to what you want because you have to scroll endlessly. Usually phones have numbered categories so u can simply press the # and get where you want to go. ===> It's a pain to put it on silent or vibrate. If you're in class and it rings, you have to turn it off immediately. There's no fast way to silence the damn thing. Always remember to put it on silent! I learned that the hard way. ===> It's so true about the case. It's a mission to get off and will break ur nails in the process. Also, you'll damage the case each time u try. For some reason the phone started giving me problems once I did succeed in opening it. ===> Buttons could be a bit bigger. Vibration could be stronger. Good: ===> Reception is not too shabby. I was using it in the elevator which is a remarkable feat considering my old phone would lose service by simply putting it in my pocket. ===> Compared to my old Samsung, this phone works quite well. The ring tones are loud enough to hear and the phone actually charges quickly and has great battery life. It doesn't heat up like a potatoe in the oven either during long phone convos. ===> Nice bright, large screen. ===> Cute ways to customize it. Scroll bar can be set to purple, pink, aqua, orange, etc. Overall: Okay phone. It serves its purpose but definitely pales in comparison to these new phones coming out from Sprint. Why get so so when you can get great?;18;18;0.0;0
I bought this phone about a year ago and have been using it ever since, on the Sprint PCS network, to replace an old TP2100. The first time I bought it, the phone was defective, so I had to get it replaced after a few days. I liked the phone okay at first, but I really wish I can go back in time and buy a better phone. Several issues: *mediocre reception. *rather bulky and unattractive. *cheap feel, cheaply made, cheap materials. *screen not easily visible in bright sunlight. *battery life marginal. I will go into a little detail about a few things. I get okay reception on this phone. It is NOT GOOD reception. The phone will work in areas where there is a good signal, but in areas with a marginal signal, such as my apartment, the phone will drop calls left and right, and fade in and out about 5 seconds of every minute (this is outside, so interference from the building is not the cause). In my residence, I use my husband's Sanyo, as it gets an excellent signal, and doesn't drop nearly as many calls. I have had Sprint check out the phone, and they say it is working correctly. I can only assume it is the poor quality of the phone that is to blame. The phone is quite big for what I would expect from a modern phone, with no camera. In a small purse, it takes up a lot of room. What is more important is that the phone is cheaply made, and has a cheap feel to it. It's made out of rather flimsy plastic. I dropped the phone once onto concrete from about 3 feet up, and the antenna head got a crack in it and a corner of the phone got serious scratches. Also, the screen can be difficult to read in bright sunlight, but it's quite bright otherwise. As far as battery life goes, it's not that great. I've gone to bed with the battery half full and have woken up to a dead phone. I believe the poor reception in my immediate area is to blame, as the phone searches for a signal and that takes battery time. Talk time is decent. Pros: *LOUD ringer *lots of features, but I rarely use them.;15;23;-0.04;0

"My problems with nextel did not stop when I canceled my service. I will get to the problems with the service. When I went to get a new phone a day before my contract expired, I of course wanted to keep my number. So as I went to get my Cingular phone (highly recommended), I had the old number switched to my new number. Today, I get in the mail my nextel statement for the month with a $200 early termination even though I had not canceled my service, but had simply got a new phone and switched my number over. This was on icing on the cake after 2 years of absolutely amazingy bad service from nextel. In my town, not a small town by any means, there are very few places that have any service. In the largest subdivision, you cannot get service anywhere. I constantly get comments from people trying to reach me that get the classic nextel line...Please hold while the nextel subscriber you are trying to reach is located. Most of the time I would not even recieve incoming calls, calls would go straight to my voice mail. Not only would I not get the calls, but often I would not even get the voice mails until days or even weeks later. When I did actually take calls (and call out), I cannot count the number of times I've had my call dropped. I recieved so many different error messages sometimes I wonder if they just spend all their time at nextel thinking of different error messages to program into their phones. That brings me to the selling point of nextel, the famed and well-loved direct connect feature. This is an absolute joke. Direct connect only works MAYBE half the time I tried to use it. Even then, in the middle of the conversation I would be greeted by the loud beep of my phone telling me I wont be talking to that person anymore. Of course, I would expect nothing less from the nextel network. Text messaging with nextel is next to impossible. If it did not take hours to send or recieve a message, it took days, or maybe didn't even come at all. The internet access was fine, it the rare instance that it worked. Of course, when you don't have service, you don't get the internet access either. I was constantly getting the message ""network not available"". Calling and trying to complain to nextel is futile. Trying to get through to customer service takes forever and once you get through they do nothing. My experience with nextel has been nothing short of a disaster and I write this trying to warn anyone considering nextel. Stick with Verizon or Cingular and you will be much happier in the end. Don't make the same mistake I did.";11;13;-0.01;0

I got this phone based on a recommendation from AT&T :( silly me. I wanted a back up phone my wife could use in case her other phone failed to turn on (also a motorola different model almost 5x price). They recommend this phone because of it's low cost and it's a go phone so you only pay for minutes you use. I bought the phone and loved it. It was very low cost, came with airtime. It feels very solid, except for the battery cover which seems flimsy but seems to hold up with no problems. It had what I felt as good sound quality and a good number of features for such a low cost phone. I wanted to prep the battery since my wife was going to travel soon, so I left it powered on and would constantly press a button so the light would stay on and drain the battery. The display is amazingly bright, I could almost use it as a flashlight. I was also really surprised at the battery life. Anyhow after two cycles of draining the battery and then charging it to full, I figured it would be all set to use as an emergency phone for my wife who was going on a two week business trip. Wrong :( on the last day of her trip her main cell phone battery was low so she decided to try to use the back up phone. It wouldn't turn on :( I don't know if it was due to the xray machines at the airports or what but the battery was drained. She said she never turned it on at all until that day so maybe it got turned on accidently in her purse (phone turns on by pressing a button on the front for 4 or 5 seconds). Anyhow to make matters worse the AT&T rep also said I could also use it as a main phone by transfering the SIM. Nope didn't work either, I was on the older AT&T plan so I had to be migrated. Atleast the phone didn't cost too much. I figure I can still keep it as an emergency 911 phone too (Go phone minutes expire :( which the AT&T rep didn't tell me about). And it does look pretty good as a paper weight.;11;12;-0.01;0

I find texting impossible on this phone. As another reviewer said, the screen goes blank randomly and you have to turn it off and on again. Also the phone randomly turns off phone transmissions and you have to turn it back on to receive/make phone calls. There has to be better phones out there.;1;3;-0.08;0
This phone is JUNK. Do NOT buy this phone. You will have much faster messaging via regular USPS. Your text messages will be lost in the vast time warp of boost mobilism where they will stay until you decide to try to use the internet on this phone. While waiting the regular 15 minutes for a webpage to load, you will be bumrushed by a million of delayed texts which will obliterate all the efforts this sorry little phone has put forth in trying to load the webpage. The screen will turn white and the entire phone will reset on its own. You will then have the responsibility of manually turning your transmitters back on for the phone to work again. If you are arguing with a girlfriend on this phone, she will dump you because she will think you have hung up on her. If you have close family members, they will abandon you and make pacts with other family members not to call or text you because you never text back and hardly ever answer. If you are having an affair with a married woman, this phone will hold all the messages you sent to her until her husband has come home. Then, like magic, this phone will deliver all the long lost messages as soon as he picks up his wife's phone. They should reaname this phone the i666. The Taliban has claimed responsibility for this phone, but common sense makes one wonder if it wasn't created by a more sinister power. Possibly Satan himself.;6;10;-0.03;0
The phone was purchased through an 'Alpha Wireless' supposedly in Texas but shipped from a 'Go Green Wireless' out of Florida. While I understand that several companies may cooperate to fulfill orders it does make it difficult regarding recourse when, in this case, a phone was represented as 'New' and simply was not. The price paid should have more closely reflected the condition. Buyer beware as usual when using Amazon or Ebay.;0;2;-0.05;0
This is probably the wrost experience i had with Amazon and it costed me $72.00. Both my phones from amazon arrived inright time but without activation. I called AT&T and they could not locate our phone numbers so had to call back amazon and learned that they have not activated our phones. Amazon customer service took good amount of time to do this meanwhile i missed by billing cycle with old cell phone company. This process took about a week, and not to mention the SIM card delivered was not working and amazon had to ship again.;1;1;0.0;0
My Alias 2 keeps shutting off, even with a full charge. I thought it might be a problem with my battery until my husband's phone started doing the same thing...several times a day! Since then, we have heard of two other people having the same problem with the Alias 2. The local Verizon store offered a software update, but with no guarantee that it would correct the problem. They claim that this phone wasn't a big seller, and they have never heard of this problem before. They refuse to look into the problem, saying that's just the nature of electronic devices...no guarantees. Anyone else having this problem?;3;7;-0.08;0
"Don't bother with this piece of junk. It is the worst phone I have ever owned. Turns itself off inexplicably 15 times a day. Shuts down in the middle of a conversation. So embarrassing. If you ""close"" it too fast, it shuts down. Also, the body of the phone is way too ""slippery"" --- I have dropped it out of my hand a dozen times only because it's too darn slippery to hold. Impossible to flip open the phone with one hand, you need both hands to open it. Terrible product. I am thinking about quitting Verizon simply because they offer this POS phone. Don't waste your time or money with this junk.";1;8;-0.13;0
Pros: Creative use of buttons, big screen, qwerty keyboard Cons: Doesn't sync with Outlook, clunky user interface, muddled audio in ear piece/speakerphone I really have to give credit to Samsung because of the creatively designed keypad, but I don't recommend this phone overall. The phone user interface isn't simple, and is made somewhat more complicated because they keyboard layout is constantly changing based on what screen you're on. For example, there's an awkward key layout in some versions of the layout, takes too many keystrokes to do things like turn off an alarm (I guess I've been spoiled by almost always owning Nokias, as they tend to have the best-designed user interfaces). Aside from the clumsy UI, the biggest thing that killed this for our family was its inability to sync contacts and calendar events with Outlook. Maybe there's a way to do it with a combination of MyVerizon and USB cables, but its not worth the effort, especially when I can switch to a Nokia that takes care of it (as an aside, I switched to AT&T a week later because of the poor phone selection at Verizon. Also, Verizon disables any Bluetooth syncing capabilities with Outlook, even for the few Nokias they offer.) Overall, the phone is designed creatively, but its hip design doesn't make up for its poor UI and lack of features that were essential to me.;6;11;-0.04;0
"My daughter and I both got the LG enV2 about 8 months ago. We're currently waiting for our third version of this. Both phones of our first phones failed within 5 months (keys stopped working on outside, dropped calls, goes back to menu in middle of texting, calls contacts at random times and much more). We got ""new"" ones, which were refurbished phones from Verizon. They lasted a few months before failing with similar problems, plus now I have almost no volume even though its maxed on the setting. We're waiting for our next set of ""new"" phones to arrive later this week. Can't wait to see how long these last. The upgrade to a different phone isn't an option until you've been in the contract one year and can only upgrade one phone then.";0;3;-0.04;0

Got this phone for temporary use while travelling in the US. Difficult to activate - had to call AT&T when the online activation wouldn't work - took 20 minutes on the phone with a very friendly AT&T associate to activate, mainly because I didn't save the plastic box it came in so didn't have the UPC number! Texting is a nightmare with cheap keys and no Qwerty keyboard. Menus are difficult to follow and aren't logical. I even found it difficult to answer when someone called. Can't wait to get home to my iPhone... BEst just to go to a store and buy one there already activated and ready to go. It's now known in my family as the StopPhone.;5;5;0.0;0

"Bought this phone used (but claimed to be refurbished), and it was supposed to be fully tested and functional. It is not. First, the battery would not hold a charge, so bought a new OEM battery. Plugged it into the supplied (with the phone) charger, and received an error message that the charger was not an authorized Motorola charger. Bought a new charger (now we;'re up to $28.99 for the phone, $6.22 for the OEM battery, and $3.50 for the new charger. The phone refuses to work. Was able to activate it over the internet via computer, but the phone itself has internal problems. It starts, then flickers and dies. Repeated attempts to make it work were useless. Even tried using the phone with the charger still plugged in, and no luck. It lights up, flickers, and then dies, over and over. This phone was not refurbished, nor even tested. It's used, and its internals do not work properly. By the time I got the new battery, and then waited for the new charger and finally was able to use the phone, it was too late to take any action about the phone's failure to even operate in basic mode. I've got what amounts to a $40 paperweight. Be very wary about buying used phones, esp those that claim to be ""refurbished"" and fully functional. You get what you pay for, and in the case of used, or refurbished phones, you're taking a big risk that it'll even work, much less be fully functional. Lesson learned. No more used phones, nor dealing with sellers of these products.";6;9;-0.02;0

This phone was advertised as Used - Mint Condition!!! When I received it, the phone looked like new and I was very excited to put the battery in and let it charge before calling my phone company to make the transfer. Once the back was removed, the phone was clearly a REFURBISHED phone from the manufacturer. Reluctantly, I placed the battery and let it charge for 12 hours until it said charge complete. I turned the phone on and let it sit for 24 hours without using it. The next day, it was totally drained. I repeated the steps again to just be sure and this time, I let the phone charge for 24 hours. Again ,I left the phone and low and behold, it was totally drained. This phone was either damaged, or had a battery problem which I will never know. I will not buy from these people again. I have to now pay for a return shipping and waste more time taking it to UPS and wait for the credit to be issued.....AGGRAVATING.....;3;7;-0.05;0

This item was purchased several months ago and has never worked. I am the mother of the under age child who hit the button to purchase this phone with a credit card she had saved on Amazon. She did not have permission or authority (our fault) to purchase it. When it came and we (parents) found out about it, the battery was dead and would not hold a charge of any kind. To use the phone it had to be plugged in. What's the purpose of having a cell (cordless) phone if you have to leave it plugged in to use? I think the person who sold her this phone knew this and wanted to dump it off on any sucker who nibbled on it.;1;4;-0.06;0

"The phone that I received was rated as being in ""very good"" condition yet the entire Get It Now/Media Store function refused to work. This is a problem that Verizon Wireless is aware of and has no plans to do anything about it. Details can be found in my review here: http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CD4BYNT4DA46/ref=cm_cr_rdp_perm (I'm not allowed to duplicate my own reviews.. even if it is for the same problem on essentially the same product). If downloads are important to you, beware because many older Verizon phones just can't do it anymore.. and the sellers don't seem to know anything about it. I sent four requests to four different sellers requesting information as to whether their phone's Get It Now/Media Store was removed and didn't get a single reply. I emailed the seller that I bought mine from, I was told that the phone was ""completely functional"" in spite of the fact that it was missing the Get It Now/Media Store (functionality that is contained in the description of the product). I was offered a refund but couldn't find a seller that would tell me if their phone worked or not.. so what's the point. Thanks a lot Verizon for breaking so many phones and thanks to the sellers that don't even know that the equipment they are selling doesn't work correctly (my seller didn't even have a Verizon account to test his phones with!). If you only make and receive calls and texts, this probably doesn't apply to you. If you want to use ANY of the phone's extended features (ringtones, music and video downloads or any application such as Navigator, Facebook, Backup Assistant, etc.), check with the seller to make sure the phone they're selling isn't suffering from the missing Get It Now/Media Store catalog problem.

"Through no fault of the resellers (and unbeknownst to most of them), many of the older Verizon phones MAY have their Get It Now/Media Store rendered unusable. This takes away the ability to download music, ringtones, videos and ANY applications (such as Backup Assistant, VZ Navigator, games, weather, maps, etc.) from Verizon. Back in late March, 2011, Verizon pushed an update to all their phones and any of the older phones that were not activated at the time lost the Get It Now/Media Store catalog with no way to retrieve it through future updates. Verizon will tell you that you can take it to a store to get it flashed to restore the Get It Now/Media Center catalog, but it seems that basically none of the stores have the ability to actually flash phones (there was a report of a store in South Carolina that could flash phones..). More information (including official input from Verizon employees) can be found on Verizon's support community forum site (search for ""Error Cannot retrieve catalog... (3328) Backup Asst..""). If you only use your phone to make calls and/or text, this information does not apply to you. If you DO use Get It Now/Media Store, you will probably want to check with the seller to make sure that the phone's Get It Now/Media Store works.. or you might end up with a Get It Not. NOTE TO READERS: My purchase and experience was with a Verizon V3m in pink. After numerous hours talking with Verizon's tech support and multiple emails, I was able to determine that the exact same problem was happening to many older Verizon phones (there were more than 50 models by LG, Motorola, Samsung, Nokia and others specifically listed in their forum).

I've complained about the volume on the ringer on this phone but the seller keeps on closing the case and denying that the phone is defective and wanted to charge me $20 for re-stocking fee if I decide to return it. I took it to Verizon store and have it checked and they admitted themselves that the phone is defective. What's the use of using a phone if you cannot hear it ring so it's just sitting here still in the original package and waiting for a solution and probably some use for it.

I have had this phone for 4 years. Yes I know most people change phones 2-3 times in that span. The number of problems that I have had with it, 0. It has lived up to its claim of being a rugged phone. I take mine in wooded areas, industrial plant areas, and even under vehicles. I don't ever remember submerging it, but it has been in water soaked clothing on numerous occasions. Call quality has been good. I am now starting to notice some more breakup in calls as the phone has aged, but at this point it is hard to complain. My biggest complaint is that it does not stay connected with blue tooth headsets as well as I would like. It almost needs line of sight if you are just sitting idle. I have tried a couple of different headsets with the same results. Sending text messages is a little difficult without a keyboard but that is a given. The camera is average. It is good for quick shots but I grab a regular camera for anything I intend to print out. The bottom line is that if you are looking for a basic, rugged, and durable flip phone, this is the one.;5;7;-0.02;0
I bought this phone because my previous one kept falling out of my belt clip and getting scratched up. I figured I'd pay the extra money to get a Mil-spec phone and not have to worry about damage happening. I have a kayak and wanted to be able to take a phone out on the boat without worry about water getting in it. I also purchased a Verizon belt clip with holder that wraps around the phone. Well this first thing I found was that the belt clip kept coming off my belt and the phone kept landing on hard floors, etc. The second thing I know the outside screen (thin plastic) is cracked. Verizon wants a minimum of $189 to replace it with a used phone (unless I'd purchased insurance). Phone repair places can't get parts to repair it. Of course this eliminates the waterproofing feature, since water can likely get in the 2 cracks on the screen. I don't mind the cracks themselves since I don't really use the outside screen. Third happening was when the holder that wraps around the phone started coming off and letting the phone fall out. That's when I discarded the belt clip/holder and started carrying the phone in my pocket. I've decided I was actually better off with the old phone. I'd have had a lot more dollars in my pocket, since the Mil spec designation adds NOTHING! Other than that it's a pretty good phone. Just don't buy it for its ruggedness.;4;10;-0.05;0
"The phone is a nuisance. The ""voice command"" function cannot be turned off and it is forever trying to talk to you. It will be in your cell phone pocket, get touched, and start in the ""learning"" routine for voice commands. It is a complete pain. The phone also is supposed to be military grade. It may be if you are in the military recruitment office. In the real world the first phone lasted only a little over a month before the flip section got broken off. The battery cover is virtually impossible to reseal so waterproof goes right out the window. The speaker phone worked for a short period of time before it started getting so garbled that it was useless too. Buy something else.";2;5;-0.05;0
this is a great phone if you're looking for a tough, simple cell...no bells or whistles here, just a standard cell. I've dropped it a bunch and hasn't cracked or broke yet. Functions great! The front screen did crack when my 2 year old son jumped on me, but that's about 25-30lbs falling onto it...any other cell probably would have cracked or even broke under the force too. Parts were cheap enough to fix it too and plenty of accessories are out there for it.;4;7;-0.08;0
Verizon Wireless sold me the phone at their corporate location in Bloomington, Il. Within 6 months of having this phone I've had to replace the battery 2 times. The voice command still does not recognize my voice half the time. The largest corporate Bloomington does not carry replacement batteries. I am blind yet the Verizon store will not help me ship the old battery out (means I have to ask for another ride to get to a mailbox). The back cover did not fit properly after the 2nd battery was removed in the VZ store. They said this phone was up to/beyond Military specifications - that's funny. If I was using this phone in the military I'd be dead months ago.;1;3;-0.03;0
The screen on the outside of the phone cracked under normal use, no dropping etc. Had it in Motorola's belt case all the time. This area of the phone is poorly designed and low end materials. The reception is good and battery life was great.;2;2;0.0;0
Phone no longer charges new battery 100%. Swapped battery from other V860, but it still fails to charge 100%. The only way I have improved this failure is to turn the phone off, flip it open, then plugin and charge it while it is opened. Weird, but it works.;2;3;-0.04;0

"I admit, I'm a contractor and I'm very tough on phones. That's why I try to buy the ""ruggedized"" phones, the heavy duty ones that are supposed to be able to handle some abuse. This phone did not live up to it's billing. I even bought two separate protective cases, a leather one, and then a hard rubber one. Even with the cases on, the phone was useless after only a month and a half. First the front screen cracked. No big deal, it happens on pretty much every phone I've had. But then, the main screen went blank, and I was left with trying to dial or pull up numbers blindly from memory. After a month and a half? very disappointed. My first phone was a motorola, and I loved it, this one did not hold up. I went with aÂ Casio GzOne Ravine 2 Verizon, instead and have been extremely happy with it. The front screen hasn't even cracked yet, and it's been over 6 months. I'd skip the Barrage and to with a Ravine 2.";5;6;-0.01;0

This phone is fine if you just want to use the prepaid plans, but if you want to activate an existing account (which I did) verizon will not allow you to do that until you have used the prepaid plan on this phone for 6 months. Not for people with existing contracts looking for a cheap way to replace their broken or lost phones. Not too many used options on Amazon for cheap phones, it is better to go to ebay if you want a used phone;2;4;-0.05;0
"Thank you Samsung for guaranteeing I never buy another cell phone made by you. After 8 months of use, this phone started making beeps when I plugged in the charger and gave spurious warning messages that it had the ""wrong battery"", ""unsupported battery"", even though it would eventually usually recharge. I called Samsung warrantee service, and they made a ticket and UPS label to send in the battery. Within two weeks after I sent it in, they finished the service and sent me an email they had shipped out a replacement. After 3 weeks it hadn't arrived, and when I checked the tracking number, I discovered they'd mailed it to some guy in Florida, not Hawaii. It took me a month of multiple phone calls and submissions on the web to get Samsung Service in Plano, Texas, to send me another battery. When it arrived and I put it in the handset, it displayed the same malfunction. So the problem was in the handset, not the battery. I called Samsung and they told me to send in the handset without the battery or the door, which I did. Three weeks later, I get an email from Samsung that they have received the shipment and ""*** PLEASE DO NOT REPLY TO THIS EMAIL*** We regret to inform you that your Samsung ticket [#####] was rejected due to the following reason. REJECTED - INCOMPLETE KIT The original item will be shipped back to you unrepaired."" and in a separate email, ""Your product was shipped on 20101122 at 102557 EST."" That message, though, was completely erroneous. Nothing was shipped back to me. It was followed by ""We received your Samsung SCH-U350MBPVZW on 11/23/2010 at 12:41 EST"". A week later, I got another message, ""Problem found: LOCK UP DURING OPERATION (SW) SOFTWARE EMERGENCY RECOVERY Solution: S/W Updated Passed All Functional Testing"", and a week after that, the handset arrived back, and now appears to be working. Would I sign up again for such an experience with a cell phone malfunction? No. There were just too many mistakes made here for this to be a fluke. Something is systematically wrong with Samsung USA. I resurrected my Motorola with a cheap OEM battery I got online, which I will continue to use.";2;15;-0.07;0
I've had this phone for roughly six months, and frankly, it's a piece of garbage. It consistently performs very poorly as far as reception goes. I've had to terminate calls because I couldn't hear the ther party well enough to continue. I never had this problem with my old Motorola EM330. Texting is a chore with the poorly laid out format requiring you to change screens for simple punctuation or numeric functions. AT&T keeps trying to blame the reception issues on a local network problem. A coworker has an identical phone with the identical problem. Other coworkers with AT&T service, but different phones do not have this issue. As an MP3 player coupled with my Bluetooth it's great. As a phone, it leaves a lot to be desired.;4;10;-0.09;0
"My son is hard on his phones, so we purchased a Samsung Ruby I for him, which lasted over two years. When that phone broke, we decided to try the newer Rugby II. After only two months, the phone would not charge. We bought a new battery and an external charger; still would not turn on. I called Samsung, but because he had a small crack in the outerscreen, the waranty was void. I was told that even though the cracked screen had nothing to do with the charging problem, the charging problem would not be covered under waranty and I would be responsilbe for all repairs, including the screen, and I wouldn't know the cost until I sent the phone to them. Instead I took the phone to a phone repair shop. They checked the phone and said the power supply was defective and it would cost more to fix than the phone is worth. It is extreemly annoying that a ""Rugged"" phone would quit after only two months and that the waranty is void because of a basically cosmetic issue with the outer screen. This phone was definatley a waste of time, energy and money for us and an example of poor customer service on the part of Samsung. He is now using a $20 Go-Phone from Wal-Mart with his ATT simm card and it has lasted much longer than the Samsung Rugby II.";1;11;-0.09;0
This phone has a big problem...You can't transfer files from your Windows 7 64 bit PC any other way other than by taking out the storage card and using a card reader!!! It does not work with Samsung's PC Studio software via USB. Get with it Samsung! If I knew that, I wouldn't have bought this phone, or the data cable which is useless. Samsung tech support first told me I had a bad data cable, then that I needed to re-load the software, then finally admitted it wasn't going to work. No more Samsungs for me. One other slightly annoying thing about the phone is that the charging port is covered by a flimsy rubber flap that is hard to take off, and doesn't look like it will last the test of time with constant use. I give it 2 stars because the call quality and reception seem fine.;5;6;-0.01;0

I got sick of the whole smart phone thing -- especially texting. If you can't take time to call someone and all you want to do is text, then you have, in my opinion, poor communication skills, or you're just a millennial, plain and simple. This phone takes you back to the basics. If you want to surf the net, you can. But the main reason I use it is for making calls. They are clear (Verizon service is tops), the phone speaker sounds great, and the buttons are big (I have big hands). Can't beat this purchase if you're looking for a durable, good looking phone.;7;2;0.1;1
"It's a Motorola flip cell phone-key word in ""cell phone"" being ""phone' I have a computer for everything else. Previous ""Barrages"" have survived swims in the ""toilet sea', the Gulf of Mexico, the washing machine rumble, etc. However, do not ""flip it open' and simultaneously allow it to flip out of your hand and land on the floor in a ""pike position"", pike facing down..! --unless you want (literally!) a two-piece phone.... great bargain.";2;0;0.04;1
Ordered 2 of their refurbished phones. Both were great. Showed a little wear, but really in great shape. They were as advertised. Service is Excellent! One of the phones had a wall charger that didn't work (didn't receive electrical current). I contacted them through Amazon. They responded immediately - shipped out new charger same day AND said I could throw the other one away. They saved me from having to do anything! No return shipping, etc. That, to me is Outstanding Customer Service! We love the phones! Perfect for people who prefer flip phone. Durable - which is good for my hunter and my 85 yr old mother! Mother likes to text some, but gets real confused with a qwerty keyboard. Texting is smooth and easy with the dial pad on this phone - works really great for her. The feature to announce who's calling helps her because some ring tones don't register with her hearing aid. The voice announce works perfect. Both users are very happy with their phones.;18;1;0.19;1
Excellent quality product... bought it for my husband years ago (who inevitably dropped and consequently broke every other flip phone we've had) and it is STILL IN GREAT CONDITION! Metal hinges are VERY strong and sturdy, and they remain tight (lid does not wiggle at all). All buttons look and work like new, screen is bright and clear. Wouldn't trade this durable little phone for any other type!;9;2;0.18;1

Great purchase. My husband and I (in our mid 20's) have no interest in smart phones or anything like that. We just wanted something simple and durable that can make phone calls. The phone, though used, works just fine. It had a few scratches on it but it works perfectly and hopefully will be disaster resistant for my husband! My husband had a history of getting cellphones wet so that was another reason we picked this one, it was listed as water resistant. We are very happy with this phone.;9;2;0.17;1
I had one touch screen phone in my life. The touch screen broke and without buttons, I couldn't even make phone calls. So I bought this tough and easy to use phone. It's perfect for my back pocket. I don't use apps or even text that much. The camera works well enough for me and I never butt dial anyone! I'm not even embarrassed that I don't have a smart phone....frankly, I don't care what people think.;7;1;0.14;1
This was a bargain! I would definitely use the seller again. I had some questions on the item and promptly received a response. Got this for my son, who really likes it, especially that it has a camera and can take a beating when going camping. The phone was received in very good condition, charged too! The transaction was easy and the item received quicker than expected in proper packaging. I especially liked that I didn't have to go with a contract.;8;0;0.22;1

"I don't have big expectations for a cell phone. I ask only that it make and receive calls, stand up to a decent amount of rough handling, and not crap out when I get a little sweaty (talking while exercising). Yeah, it sounds silly, but I've had several that died from that small amount of moisture. The Barrage has been good to me so far (about 40 days). It's my first phone with a data package and, if that were important to me, I'd go for a larger screen. This one is big enough, though, to handle an occasional look at my e-mail or a quick browse here or there. As a ""free"" phone (for 2-year contract commitment) I'd say I'm quite happy with it. Someday I may spring the big bucks for a droid or some such (my wife loves her droid-x), but for now this is just fine.";9;5;0.06;1
I got a lot more phone than I thought I would with this. The camera is better than any I have had before, and it shoots video, too. I just needed something inexpensive to get me through to my next upgrade when my old phone died, and this was perfect. I also got it in less time than amazon said I would, which was great.;4;1;0.11;1
You can have all of the little computers they call smart phones. I cannot read anything written on it. If I want a camera, I'll use a camera. I just wanted a phone. This one works well. Before long the 'smart phones' will also be vibrators and the airheads won't be able to decide which end to apply them to.;4;0;0.15;1

Service was excellent. Came in less time than I was told it would and seller e-mailed me about return policy and seemed to really care if I was happy with my phone.

My husband does not want a smart phone and this is exactly what he wants. Makes/receives calls, voice activated messaging and texting, access to Internet for basic usage, vz navigator for directions. Allows access for downloading ringtones, etc. Actually has more to it than we originally expected when we ordered it. Got a new phone of an older model, great buy, very satisfied with our $68 phone! PROBLEM: after a few days of use, we are returning this phone. We really liked all the features and we're so disappointed the voice audio stopped working. No voice sound at all. Other types of sounds worked, but no voice. Verizon technician said this was a very old model and had to go through extra searching to look it up to try to assist us. Wouldn't care about the age if it just worked!!!;6;2;0.06;1

My husband likes basic phones. He had a Motorola when we were stuck with Sprint, but now that we are finally free and have service...he needed a phone that would work with Verizon service (which I am thrilled with btw-can place calls and do not get disconnected).

Calls are clear...much clearer than with mine...lol.;9;2;0.16;1

"YES, I still use a flip phone. I've tried a couple of different ""smart"" phones, but do not need, nor want, to be that in touch with the world. This Motorola V860 phone has great sound, can set an alarm, takes reasonable good pictures, I can send a text message, use Bluetooth in my truck, use a calculator and, set an appointment with the calendar. That is what I will use a phone for, and this Motorola V860 does all of that very well. Just to solidify my dinosaur status, I keep a new back-up V860 in my office all the time, so when the one I am using breaks down (every 4-5 years), I have that back-up to activate immediately. Then, I order another back-up V860. :)";5;2;0.05;1
Since I was looking for a very basic phone, this one meets my needs wonderfully. It arrived promptly, in nearly-new condition, along with a new generic charger. It seems to be quite substantial, and the sound quality is better than some of the more expensive phones I've had in the past. It holds a charge quite well, and since it isn't one of the newer phones, I don't have to pay for a data plan. If you just need a basic phone with your Verizon cell service, this is a great choice. I called Verizon Customer Service to make the change from my old phone, quick and easy, although I had to re-enter all my contacts manually. I imagine that going to a Verizon store might allow you to automatically transfer all your contacts. Overall, an excellent choice for a basic phone.;7;1;0.08;1
this phone has exceeded my expectations, would definitely refer others seeking a simular type phone to consider this phone. The only thing I wish was different, is that there if was a data/charge cord from the computer to the phone, because since I live in nursing home there are shortages of available electrical outlates and its easier amd safer to just be able to use a usb port to be able to charge my phone;3;1;0.05;1
I bought one phone for a friend as a gift and the phone worked great, looked great and was shipped very fast. I was so impressed with the phone that when it came time for he's wife to get a phone I reordered from the same company and got her the exact same phone. Now they both have great working phone are easy for them to operate. They are both in their 70s and this phone has big buttons that are easy to see and the phones are made to be tough for the fall's that they are put through.;9;1;0.21;1
This phone is the perfect choice if you work in an outdoor environment, It is an extremely sturdy phone and can survive quite a bit of abuse. the sound is exceptionally clear and allows increased volume in noisy situations. It was advertised as not including a camera but it has one and takes great pictures. All in all, this is a great cell phone. This is the fourth one in our family in five years and we all prefer this model.;8;2;0.16;1
These are pretty bullet proof phones and are good for buying used phones. I Ordered two of these after flushing my old faithful down into the depths of the earth, one from NC and this one from Texas. The other phone ordered from the NC reseller was in my mailbox two days after the ordered and was in great shape with a new fresh charged battery and is currently living in my pocket. However this phone arrived a week and a half later with a flat battery and a lot of battle scars but still was in working order. Like I said this model is bullet proof otherwise I wonder if the outcome would have been the same with a more fragile version of flip phone. I gave three stars because of the long wait, flat battery, and battle scars. Not so much the battle scars.;7;4;0.04;1
This item was delivered promptly and was easy to activate. It was as advertised and we have no complaints.;2;1;0.14;1
Good phone , I lost one like it that I had for 6 years with no problems, so I got a new one just like it!;3;2;0.09;1
My husband loved his new phone! He liked the operation and simplicity of this phone better than his old one. I would reccommend to anyone who doesn't want or need a lot of bells and whistles.;3;0;0.16;1
My hubby is dangerous on cell phones. He drops then ask the time in water in dirt pretty probably even in the toilet....Lol this phone is durable and small enough fir his pocket he loves it.;4;2;0.1;1
I've had this phone for one year. This phone is a great PHONE. I don't use it for anything else except making and receiving calls, and it is excellent. The reception is as good as my old Motorola KRZR. The internal speaker is loud and clear and filters out a great deal of ambient sound on my end. The speakerphone is an all star! Crisp and LOUD and simple to use, the speakerphone makes a headset seem silly to bother with. The ruggedness is great for my needs, the occasional fall, the keys are very grit-proof, and I can personally vouch for the waterproof rating. My Barrage went through the washing machine and has been dropped in the bathtub twice, both were no problem. If you want a phone for internet, email and pictures this phone may not be for you, I wouldn't know, for me this phone is an all star.;8;6;0.03;1
Serves my needs. Reception seems to be good to excellent everywhere. Easy to use-I'm old, and not adept at gadget laden phone. 5 months out it's been reliable so far. (1) No opinion on the camera. Phone camera are crap compared to real cameras as far as I'm concerned, so I keep a real camera on me or near. (2) Not much account for texting. I hate texting, but my friends send them to me anyway, and in abundance. It works, but is slow and inefficient. (3) Things like input and deletion of contacts has been very simple for me, and understand I am a technophobe. (4) Could hardly be easier to carry. (5) I am beginning to maybe trust Verizon, so I could see being on a plan, but the month-to-month no contract aspect of this thing is very appealing. In general I trust phone companies less than I trust MDs or Cygna insurance, which is to say not at all. (6) Charges pretty quickly on even a vehicle charger. And chargers for this odd obscure little piglet have not been hard to find even around here.;13;8;0.05;1

"Want more reasons to buy this phone? It runs like a champ, its fast enough for its price but the specs are actually pretty darn good. The camera, whilst is not that good for video, considering its lack of any sort of IS, is surprisingly good for taking photos, including a Ultra-Wide mode that makes photos sooo much easier. It includes Dual SIM compatibility, something every phone should come with, coming from someone with two numbers. Also, the back panel, whilst not being glass, it doesn't feel cheap at all. And it's actually good if you are the sort of people that cracks phone glasses a lot. The screen has good colors, deep blacks, and my only complaint is that for a 6 inch display 720p is a little low, but to be honest, regularly you won't notice it (unless you're looking for it) and, to be honest, a 6 inch phone with a AMOLED panel for this cheap is too much for what you may find. The battery life is a freaking champ. A 720p, 3GB device of course drains less battery than higher class devices but if you sum up a 4000mAh battery, this phone can last you the full day without reaching 20%. And, heck, I'm the kind of people that uses their phones a lot on their day, and I've never got an ""Battery low"" notification, all without hitting Power saving mode. For $150, this phone is a deal sealer. Really worth buying.";15;8;0.05;1
Overall the phone is great. It came in with Spanish text and 60% battery but it was nothing a factory reset won't fix (Should do it regardless). Customization is fantastic. Don't like the teardrop notch? Go to settings, display, fullscreen apps, advance and replace it with a bar. Too zoomed out? Adjust the zoom and font style. Fingerprint and face recognition is also fantastic. Battery life is ridiculous. I go to school for 5-7 hours, travel on the train for 2 more and with casual use in between and I struggle to get below 70. Incredible battery life. Only real problem is watching full screen video. Navigation bar doesn't go away unless you're playing a game. Other than that I can't complain too much. Fantastic phone;6;4;0.03;1
This phone is a fraction of the price of modern flagship, top-of-the-line, smartphones, but it works really well considering the price. Iâ€™ve had this phone for a couple of days and here is what I have noticed: - If you are coming from a flagship phone, the first thing you probably will notice as you switch between apps is how slow this phone is. Yes, the processor is not amazing and Google Maps takes a long time to load, but thatâ€™s the number one thing you should expect with a phone sub $200! Itâ€™s not something you couldnâ€™t get used to with time and patience. Sooo donâ€™t expect to be playing any intensive games without some lag and/or app shut down. - While the resolution of this phone isnâ€™t spectacular, the colors are incredibly vibrant! Samsung makes amazing screens. This makes the phone look more expensive than it is. - The exterior of the phone feels like cheap plastic, including the lock and volume buttons. Not a big deal if you have a case (which is recommended for any smart phone). - The camera quality is really great. Iâ€™m quite shocked by how crisp the pictures turned out! Usually when purchasing a smartphone of this price you can pretty much assume the camera will be terrible with pixelated image quality, but Samsung does a great job with making sure this doesnâ€™t happen. - The speaker audio is pretty terrible, but nothing you couldnâ€™t get used to... - Fingerprint reader is very responsive! - Samsung Themes lets you customize the phones UI, which is really nice. There are quite a lot of different free themes to choose from on the market. - Iâ€™ve had little to no issues with reception/data with t-mobile while using this phone. 5 stars for the price. Some small flaws that come with a cheaper phone, but nothing too detrimental for a person who just needs a phone (with good screen + camera) for everyday use. If you expect more than this then you are expecting too much and you may need to raise your budget for something that suits your expectations.;23;10;0.08;1
This phone has really impressed me, I would say it's competing with phones in the $600 range with all of its included features and specs. I upgrade from the Nokia 7.1 which I was also happy with, but the Motorola is noticeably faster and has a lot more features! The face detection to unlock the phone is slick, the built-in headphone jack and FM radio antenna are handy, the 3500mAH battery lasts me all day. At this price point, I don't know why anyone would pay for the more expensive samsung or pixel phones. I know that they have marginally faster processors, but that can't be noticeably worth paying twice the price. The 21:9 ratio screen seems large at first, but it is nice for streaming cinematic movies and helps to make up for the hole punch of a front facing camera. You don't notice it when the notification bar gets blacked out during normal ratio pictures and movies. Which, by the way, the camera on this phone is amazing in low light and with action shots! Also, this phone runs on a pure android one system, so you will get guaranteed systems updates monthly for two years minimum. That alone is all I need to hear to feel confident about the phone!;11;3;0.07;1
This is an amazing phone. Very quick to do what you need it to do. Has a very fast processor in it. Sound is realistic and loud, if you need it to be. Camera is great and takes good pics. Using the movie feature is astounding, as it makes top of the line home movie clips! Screen is vivid and beautiful. Also, the phone is easy to hold on to. The battery lasts me all day with moderate to slightly heavy usuage. You really can't go wrong with this phone and I am glad I bought it! You'll be glad you bought it too!ðŸ˜;12;2;0.21;1
