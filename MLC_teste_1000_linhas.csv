Expression of p53 and coexistence of HPV in premalignant lesions and in cervical cancer.,"Fifty-four paraffin embedded tissue sections from patients with dysplasia (21 cases) and with cervical cancer (33 cases) were analysed. HPV was detected and identified in two stages. Firstly, using mixed starters, chosen genomic DNA sequences were amplified; secondly the material thus obtained was analyzed by hybridization method using oligonucleotyde 31-P labelled probe. HPVs of type 6, 11, 16, 18, 33 were identified. The p-53 expression was assayed by immunohistochemical method. HPV infection was often associated with dysplasia and cervical cancer. In cervical cancer mainly HPV 16 and 18 with high oncogenic potential were found. The p-53 was present rarely, and in minute quantities. No correlation was observed between presence of p-53 and HPVs DNA.","['DNA Probes, HPV', 'DNA, Viral', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Papillomaviridae', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53', 'Uterine Cervical Dysplasia', 'Uterine Cervical Neoplasms']",8549602,"[['D13.444.600.223.555', 'D27.505.259.750.600.223.620', 'D27.720.470.530.600.223.620'], ['D13.444.308.568'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E01.370.225.500.607.512', 'E01.370.225.750.551.512', 'E05.200.500.607.512', 'E05.200.750.551.512', 'E05.478.583', 'H01.158.100.656.234.512', 'H01.158.201.344.512', 'H01.158.201.486.512', 'H01.181.122.573.512', 'H01.181.122.605.512'], ['B04.280.210.655', 'B04.613.204.655'], ['D12.776.157.687.650', 'D12.776.260.820', 'D12.776.624.776.775', 'D12.776.660.720.650', 'D12.776.744.845'], ['C04.834.818', 'C13.351.500.852.593.074'], ['C04.588.945.418.948.850', 'C13.351.500.852.593.131', 'C13.351.500.852.762.850', 'C13.351.937.418.875.850']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]', 'Diseases [C]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
Vitamin D status in pregnant Indian women across trimesters and different seasons and its correlation with neonatal serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels.,"The present cross-sectional study was conducted to determine the vitamin D status of pregnant Indian women and their breast-fed infants. Subjects were recruited from the Department of Obstetrics, Armed Forces Clinic and Army Hospital (Research and Referral), Delhi. A total of 541 apparently healthy women with uncomplicated, single, intra-uterine gestation reporting in any trimester were consecutively recruited. Of these 541 women, 299 (first trimester, ninety-seven; second trimester, 125; third trimester, seventy-seven) were recruited in summer (April-October) and 242 (first trimester, fifty-nine, second trimester, ninety-three; third trimester, ninety) were recruited in winter (November-March) to study seasonal variations in vitamin D status. Clinical, dietary, biochemical and hormonal evaluations for the Ca-vitamin D-parathormone axis were performed. A subset of 342 mother-infant pairs was re-evaluated 6 weeks postpartum. Mean serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) of pregnant women was 23.2 (SD 12.2) nmol/l. Hypovitaminosis D (25(OH)D < 50 nmol/l) was observed in 96.3 % of the subjects. Serum 25(OH)D levels were significantly lower in winter in the second and third trimesters, while serum intact parathormone (iPTH) and alkaline phosphatase levels were significantly higher in winter in all three trimesters. A significant negative correlation was found between serum 25(OH)D and iPTH in mothers (r - 0.367, P = 0.0001) and infants (r - 0.56, P = 0.0001). A strong positive correlation was observed between 25(OH)D levels of mother-infant pairs (r 0.779, P = 0.0001). A high prevalence of hypovitaminosis D was observed in pregnancy, lactation and infancy with no significant inter-trimester differences in serum 25(OH)D levels.","['Adult', 'Alkaline Phosphatase', 'Breast Feeding', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'India', 'Infant', 'Infant Nutrition Disorders', 'Lactation', 'Mothers', 'Nutritional Status', 'Parathyroid Hormone', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Complications', 'Pregnancy Trimesters', 'Seasons', 'Vitamin D', 'Vitamin D Deficiency', 'Vitamins', 'Young Adult']",21736816,"[['M01.060.116'], ['D08.811.277.352.650.035'], ['F01.145.407.199', 'G07.203.650.195', 'G07.203.650.220.500.500', 'G07.203.650.353.199'], ['E05.318.372.500.875', 'N05.715.360.330.500.875', 'N06.850.520.450.500.875'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['Z01.252.245.393'], ['M01.060.703'], ['C18.654.422'], ['G08.686.523', 'G08.686.702.500'], ['F01.829.263.500.320.200', 'I01.880.853.150.500.340.270', 'M01.620.630'], ['G07.203.650.650', 'N01.224.425.525'], ['D06.472.699.590', 'D12.644.548.587'], ['G08.686.784.769'], ['C13.703'], ['G08.686.707'], ['G01.910.645.661', 'G16.500.275.071.590', 'N06.230.300.100.250.525'], ['D04.210.500.812.768'], ['C18.654.521.500.133.770'], ['D27.505.696.494.600', 'G07.203.300.681.500.600', 'J02.500.681.500.600'], ['M01.060.116.815']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]']",0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1
[Identification of a functionally important dipeptide in sequences of atypical opioid peptides].,"The occurrence of individual amino acids and dipeptide fragments in the sequences of 60 known atypical opioid peptides was analyzed. An expressed predominance of Tyr-Pro fragment suggested a high probability of analgesic activity for this dipeptide, and it was experimentally studied. It was shown on somatic and visceral pain sensitivity models that, on the i.p. administration of Tyr-Pro at doses of 1.0-10 mg/kg of body mass, it exhibits an analgesic activity eliminated by naloxone and naloxone methiodide. However, in tests on ileum preparations of guinea pig and mouse vas deferens in vitro, Tyr-Pro was devoid of opioid activity, which proved its indirect influence on opioid receptors.","['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Analgesics, Opioid', 'Animals', 'Consensus Sequence', 'Dipeptides', 'Guinea Pigs', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Muscle Contraction', 'Muscle, Smooth', 'Narcotic Antagonists', 'Opioid Peptides', 'Pain Measurement', 'Rats', 'Receptor, Cannabinoid, CB1', 'Receptors, Opioid']",19060934,"[['G02.111.570.060', 'L01.453.245.667.060'], ['D27.505.696.277.600.500', 'D27.505.696.663.850.014.760.500', 'D27.505.954.427.040.550.500', 'D27.505.954.427.210.600.500'], ['B01.050'], ['G02.111.570.580.175'], ['D12.644.456.345'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.550'], ['E05.481'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500'], ['L01.453.245.667'], ['G11.427.494'], ['A02.633.570', 'A10.690.467'], ['D27.505.696.543', 'D27.505.696.663.850.512', 'D27.505.954.427.550'], ['D12.644.400.575', 'D12.776.631.650.575'], ['E01.370.600.550.324'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700'], ['D12.776.543.750.695.125.100'], ['D12.776.543.750.695.620', 'D12.776.543.750.720.600.610', 'D12.776.543.750.750.555.610']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
Multilayer capsules: a promising microencapsulation system for transplantation of pancreatic islets.,"In 1980, Lim and Sun introduced a microcapsule coated with an alginate/polylysine complex for encapsulation of pancreatic islets. Characteristic to this type of capsule is, that it consists of a plain membrane which is formed during a single procedural step. With such a simple process it is difficult to obtain instantly a membrane optimized with respect to all the properties requested for islet transplantation. To overcome these difficulties, it is recommended to build up the membrane in several consecutive steps, each optimized for a certain property. In this study, we have analysed such a multilayer microcapsule for the encapsulation of pancreatic islets. Therefore, empty and islet containing alginate beads were coated with alternating layers of polyethyleneimine, polyacrylacid or carboxymethylcellulose and alginate. By scanning electron microscopy the thickness of the covering multilayer-membrane was estimated to be less than 800 nm by comparison with an apparatus scale. Ellipsometric measurements showed that the membrane thickness is in the range of 145 nm. Neither the encapsulation procedure, nor the membrane-forming step did impede the stimulatory response of the islets. The encapsulation even lead to a significantly better stimulatory response of the encapsulated islets during week three and five of cell culture. Furthermore, the multilayer-membrane did not deteriorate the biocompatibility of the transplanted microcapsules, allowing an easy tuning of the molecular cut-off and the mechanical stability depending on the polycation-polyanion combination used. The multilayer membrane capsule has obvious advantages compared to a one-step encapsulation procedure. These beads guarantee a high biocompatibility, a precisely adjusted cut-off, an optimal insulin-response and high mechanical stability although the membrane is only 145 nm thick.","['Acrylic Resins', 'Alginates', 'Animals', 'Biocompatible Materials', 'Biopolymers', 'Carboxymethylcellulose Sodium', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Compressive Strength', 'Drug Compounding', 'Female', 'Fibrosis', 'Glucuronic Acid', 'Hexuronic Acids', 'Islets of Langerhans Transplantation', 'Materials Testing', 'Microspheres', 'Muscle, Skeletal', 'Particle Size', 'Permeability', 'Polyethyleneimine', 'Polyethylenes', 'Polylysine', 'Prostheses and Implants', 'Quaternary Ammonium Compounds', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred Lew', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Transplantation, Heterotopic']",11426874,"[['D05.750.716.822.111', 'D25.720.716.822.111', 'J01.637.051.720.716.822.111'], ['D09.698.068'], ['B01.050'], ['D25.130', 'D27.720.102.130', 'J01.637.051.130'], ['D05.750.078', 'D25.720.099', 'J01.637.051.720.099'], ['D09.698.365.180.663.329'], ['A11.251'], ['G01.374.180'], ['E05.916.270'], ['C23.550.355'], ['D02.241.081.844.915.162.249', 'D02.241.152.811.162.500', 'D02.241.511.902.915.162.500', 'D09.811.922.162.500'], ['D02.241.081.844.915.400', 'D02.241.152.811.400', 'D02.241.511.902.915.400', 'D09.811.922.400'], ['E02.095.147.500.250', 'E04.270.550', 'E04.936.225.375'], ['E05.570'], ['E07.565'], ['A02.633.567', 'A10.690.552.500'], ['G02.712'], ['G02.723'], ['D02.455.326.271.665.550.600', 'D02.491.650', 'D05.750.716.507.600', 'D25.720.716.507.600', 'J01.637.051.720.716.507.600'], ['D02.455.326.271.665.550', 'D05.750.716.507', 'D25.720.716.507', 'J01.637.051.720.716.507'], ['D12.125.068.555.750', 'D12.125.095.647.750', 'D12.644.760'], ['E07.695'], ['D01.625.062.500', 'D02.092.877', 'D02.675.276'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700'], ['B01.050.050.199.520.760.280', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700.400.280'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700.750'], ['E04.936.800']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Diseases [C]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
"Nanohydrogel with N,N'-bis(acryloyl)cystine crosslinker for high drug loading.","Substantially improved hydrogel particles based on poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (pNIPA) have been obtained. First, as a result of replacing commercially available N,N'-bis(acryloyl)cystamine (BAC), the crosslinker, with acryloyl derivative of cystine containing a carboxylic group (BISS), the hydrogel particles acquired improved stability vs. ionic strength and allowed further chemical modification of the chains, including the attachment of drug molecules. Next, a redox-initiated aqueous precipitation polymerization via the semi-batch method was used. This led to substantially increased BISS content and diminished size of the nanoparticles that made them suitable to an endocytic process. In addition, the obtained nanogels revealed high loading capacity of anticancer drug vs. dry gel (circa 16%) and they exhibited much better stability and enhanced drug release under the typical conditions existing in cancer cells. Size of obtained nanogels was investigated by dynamic light scattering (DLS). It appeared that nanoparticle size was in the range from ca. 40 to 200nm. In 0.01M solution of glutathione (GSH) the -S-S- bonds were reduced and the nanogel particles were degraded. This could be seen in obtained SEM and TEM micrographs. The cytotoxicity investigation against the HeLa cells showed that DOX loaded nanogels were more cytotoxic (IC50=0.51ìM) than free DOX (IC50=0.83ìM), while unloaded nanogels did not inhibit proliferation of the cells. It was also found that the nanogels loaded with DOX reached a high intracellular concentration in HeLa cells just after 2h while free DOX needed 6h for that.","['Antineoplastic Agents', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Survival', 'Cross-Linking Reagents', 'Cystine', 'Doxorubicin', 'Drug Carriers', 'Drug Liberation', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Hydrogels', 'Nanoparticles']",28323099,"[['D27.505.954.248'], ['G04.161.750', 'G07.345.249.410.750'], ['G04.346'], ['D27.720.470.410.210'], ['D01.248.497.158.874.390.369', 'D01.875.350.850.150.369', 'D02.886.030.230.369', 'D02.886.520.150.087', 'D12.125.095.369', 'D12.125.119.369', 'D12.125.166.230.369'], ['D02.455.426.559.847.562.050.200.175', 'D04.615.562.050.200.175', 'D09.408.051.059.200.175'], ['D26.255.260', 'E02.319.300.380'], ['G02.211', 'G03.787.321', 'G07.690.725.321'], ['A11.251.210.190.400', 'A11.251.860.180.400', 'A11.436.340'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D20.280.320.375', 'D26.255.165.320.375'], ['J01.637.512.600']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
"A new <i>Panolis</i> H?bner, [1821] species from Vietnam (Lepidoptera, Noctuidae, Orthosiini).","Panolis is a well-defined and compact Palearctic trifine Noctuidae genus within the subfamily Hadeninae, tribus Orthosiini. It is currently represented by seven species and one subspecies: Panolis flammea ([Denis & Schifferm?ller], 1775), Panolis japonica Draudt, 1935, Panolis variegatoides Poole, 1989, Panolis exquisita Draudt, 1950, Panolis pinicortex Draudt, 1950, Panolis pinicortex exornata Hreblay & Ronkay, 1997, Panolis estheri Ronkay, Ronkay, Gyulai & Hacker, 2010 and Panolis ningshan Wang, Fan, Owada, Wang & Nylin, 2014. Only one species (P. flammea) occurs in the Western Palearctic region, while all others are found in the eastern part of Asia. No Panolis species is known outside of the Palearctic region. The genus is connected to coniferous woodlands as the larvae are feed on various species of pines. Imagoes are on the wing during the spring, from late February until May. All Panolis species have an unmistakable, rather decorative external appearance with fine and conspicuous pink-red-purple or dark orange ground colouration, and remarkable noctuid patterns. Most recent information about the genus was provided by Wang et. al, 2014, including his description of a new species, and a morphological and molecular analysis in order to reconstructing the phylogeny of the genus, and exploring its Chines Oriental origin. Present paper contains the description of a new Panolis species found recently in Vietnam, from where the genus was not known so far.

Tramadol vs dexmedetomidine for emergence agitation control in pediatric patients undergoing adenotonsillectomy with sevoflurane anesthesia: prospective randomized controlled clinical study.,"BACKGROUND: This study was designed to compare the efficacy of an intraoperative single dose administration of tramadol and dexmedetomidine on hemodynamics and postoperative recovery profile including pain, sedation, emerge reactions in pediatric patients undergoing adenotonsillectomy with sevoflurane anesthesia.METHODS: Seventy-seven patient, aged 2-12, undergoing adenotonsillectomy with sevoflurane anesthesia was enrolled in this study. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either intravenous 2 mg/kg tramadol (Group T; n = 39) or 1 ìg/kg dexmedetomidine (Group D; n = 38) after intubation. Heart rates (HR), mean arterial pressure (MAP) were recorded before induction, at induction and every 5 min after induction. Observational pain scores (OPS), pediatric anesthesia emergence delirium (PAED) scores, percentage of patients with OPS ? 4 or PAED scale items 4 or 5 with an intensity of 3 or 4, and Ramsay sedation scores (RSS) were recorded on arrival to the postoperative care unit (PACU) and at 5, 10, 15, 30, 45, 60 min. Extubation time and time to reach Alderete score > 9 were recorded.RESULTS: Dexmedetomidine significantly decreased the HR and MAP 10 and 15 min after induction; increased the RSS 15, 30 and 45 min after arrival to PACU.

Nucleotide diphosphates activate the ATP-sensitive potassium channel in mouse skeletal muscle.,"Patch-clamp techniques were used to study the effects of internal nucleotide diphosphates on the KATP channel in mouse skeletal muscle. In inside-out patches, application of GDP (100 microM) and ADP (100 microM) reversibly increased the channel activity. In the presence of internal Mg2+ (1 mM), low concentrations of ADP (< 300 microM) enhanced channel activity and high concentrations of ADP (> 300 microM) limited channel opening while GDP activated the channel at all concentrations tested. In the absence of internal Mg2+, ADP decreased channel activity at all concentrations tested while GDP had no noticeable effect at submillimolar concentrations and inhibited channel activity at millimolar concentrations. GDP [beta S] (100 microM), which behaved as a weak GDP agonist in the presence of Mg2+, stimulated ADP-evoked activation whereas it inhibited GDP-evoked activation. The K+ channel opener pinacidil was found to activate the KATP channel but only in the presence of internal GDP, ADP and GDP [beta S]. The results are discussed in terms of the existence of multiple nucleotide binding sites, in charge of the regulation of the KATP channel.","['Adenosine Diphosphate', 'Adenosine Triphosphate', 'Animals', 'Electrophysiology', 'Guanosine Diphosphate', 'Magnesium', 'Mice', 'Muscles', 'Potassium Channels', 'Thionucleotides']",1488275,"[['D03.633.100.759.646.138.124', 'D13.695.667.138.124', 'D13.695.827.068.124'], ['D03.633.100.759.646.138.236', 'D13.695.667.138.236', 'D13.695.827.068.236'], ['B01.050'], ['H01.158.344.528', 'H01.158.782.236'], ['D03.633.100.759.646.454.340', 'D13.695.667.454.340', 'D13.695.827.426.340'], ['D01.268.552.437', 'D01.268.557.500', 'D01.552.547.500'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500'], ['A02.633', 'A10.690'], ['D12.776.157.530.400.600', 'D12.776.543.550.450.750', 'D12.776.543.585.400.750'], ['D02.886.765', 'D13.695.900']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
Using Standardized Checklists Increase the Completion Rate of Critical Actions in an Evacuation from the Operating Room: A Randomized Controlled Simulation Study.,"INTRODUCTION: Hospital evacuations of patients with special needs are extremely challenging, and it is difficult to train hospital workers for this rare event.Hypothesis/Problem:Researchers developed an in-situ simulation study investigating the effect of standardized checklists on the evacuation of a patient under general anesthesia from the operating room (OR) and hypothesized that checklists would improve the completion rate of critical actions and decrease evacuation time.METHODS: A vertical evacuation of the high-fidelity manikin (SimMan3G; Laerdal Inc.; Norway) was performed and participants were asked to lead the team and evacuate the manikin to the ground floor after a mock fire alarm. Participants were randomized to two groups: one was given an evacuation checklist (checklist group [CG]) and the other was not (non-checklist group [NCG]). A total of 19 scenarios were run with 28 participants.RESULTS: Mean scenario time, preparation phase of evacuation, and time to transport the manikin down the stairs did not differ significantly between groups (P = .369, .462, and .935, respectively). The CG group showed significantly better performance of critical actions, including securing the airway, taking additional drug supplies, and taking additional equipment supplies (P = .047, .001, and .001, respectively). In the post-evacuation surveys, 27 out of 28 participants agreed that checklists would improve the evacuation process in a real event.CONCLUSION: Standardized checklists increase the completion rate of pre-defined critical actions in evacuations out of the OR, which likely improves patient safety. Checklist use did not have a significant effect on total evacuation time.","['Checklist', 'Civil Defense', 'Emergencies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Natural Disasters', 'Operating Rooms', 'Patient Care Team', 'Patient Safety', 'Simulation Training', 'Time Factors', 'United States']",31389323,"[['N05.715.360.300.179'], ['I01.451.227'], ['C23.550.291.781', 'N06.230.100.083', 'N06.850.376'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['N06.230.100.230'], ['N02.278.388.700'], ['N04.590.715'], ['N06.850.135.060.075.399'], ['I02.903.847'], ['G01.910.857'], ['Z01.107.567.875']]","['Health Care [N]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Geographicals [Z]']",0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1
"Tolerability of the low-affinity, use-dependent NMDA antagonist AR-R15896AR in stroke patients: a dose-ranging study.","BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: AR-R15896AR is a use-dependent, low-affinity blocker of the NMDA ion channel with neuroprotective effects in animal models of focal cerebral ischemia. This study aimed to establish the highest safe and tolerated loading and maintenance dosing regimen of AR-R15896AR in acute ischemic stroke patients and to determine the associated plasma concentrations of AR-R15896AR.METHODS: This was a 4-part, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in 175 patients (mean age, 69 years) within 24 hours of acute stroke symptom recognition. Ascending 60-minute intravenous infusion loading doses of AR-R15896AR were initially examined (100, 150, 200, 250, or 300 mg or placebo in 3:1 randomization, n=36 treated); in part 2, 250, 275, or 300 mg was compared with placebo (n=33). In part 3, a 250-mg loading dose was followed by 9 maintenance doses of 60, 75, 90, 105, or 120 mg every 8 hours versus placebo in 3:1 randomization (n=59); subsequently, in part 4, maintenance doses of 90, 105, and 120 mg after the 250-mg loading dose were directly randomized against placebo (n=42). Safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics were the primary end points; NIHSS at 1 week and Barthel and modified Rankin scores at 1 month were also recorded, but the study was neither designed nor powered to assess efficacy.RESULTS: Rates for mortality and serious adverse events (SAE) were similar in active and placebo groups (9% mortality and 23% SAE for all active combined versus 11% mortality and 33% SAE for placebo). Adverse events associated with AR-R15896AR were dizziness, vomiting, nausea, stupor, and some agitation/hallucination. Withdrawal from treatment occurred only in response to loading doses with AR-R15896AR: placebo, 3 of 46 (7%); 250 mg, 11 of 89 (12%); 275 mg, 1 of 8 (12.5%); and 300 mg, 3 of 15 (20%). No significant difference in outcome was observed between groups. Plasma concentrations of AR-R15896AR were 1524+/-536 ng/mL at the end of the 250-mg loading infusion and were 1847+/-478 ng/mL at steady state after the 9 maintenance doses of 120 mg.CONCLUSIONS: The maximum tolerated loading infusion of AR-R15896AR in this study was 250 mg over a period of 1 hour. Subsequent maintenance infusions of 120 mg every 8 hours were well tolerated. With these doses, putative neuroprotective concentrations of 1240 ng/mL are attained by the loading dose and are satisfactorily maintained thereafter. The loading dose may be improved further by adjustment on an individual patient basis, but tolerability issues remain.","['Aged', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Drug Evaluation', 'Excitatory Amino Acid Antagonists', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Male', 'Pyridines', 'Receptors, N-Methyl-D-Aspartate', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Stroke', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Outcome']",11157184,"[['M01.060.116.100'], ['G07.690.773.875', 'G07.690.936.500'], ['E05.318.370.300', 'E05.581.500.300', 'N05.715.360.325.320', 'N06.850.520.445.300'], ['E05.290.625', 'E05.337.425'], ['D27.505.519.625.190.300', 'D27.505.696.577.190.300'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E02.319.267.082.500', 'E02.319.267.510.590'], ['D03.383.725'], ['D12.776.157.530.400.400.500.500', 'D12.776.543.550.450.500.200.500', 'D12.776.543.585.400.500.200.500', 'D12.776.543.750.720.200.450.400.500'], ['E05.318.308.980.438.475.456.500', 'N05.715.360.300.800.438.375.364.500', 'N06.850.520.308.980.438.475.364.500'], ['C10.228.140.300.775', 'C14.907.253.855'], ['E05.318.308.985.550.900', 'N01.224.935.698.826', 'N06.850.505.400.975.550.900', 'N06.850.520.308.985.550.900'], ['E01.789.800', 'N04.761.559.590.800', 'N05.715.360.575.575.800']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
Spatial distribution of external and internal intercostal activity in dogs.,"1. The observation that the external and internal interosseous intercostal muscles in the dog show marked regional differences in mechanical advantage has prompted us to re-examine the topographic distribution of electrical activity among these muscles during spontaneous breathing. 2. Inspiratory activity was recorded only from the areas of the external intercostals with an inspiratory mechanical advantage, and expiratory activity was recorded only from the areas of the internal intercostals with an expiratory mechanical advantage. The expiratory discharges previously recorded from the caudal external intercostals and the inspiratory discharges recorded from the rostral internal intercostals were probably due to cross-contamination. 3. Activity in each muscle area was also quantified relative to the activity measured during tetanic, supramaximal nerve stimulation (maximal activity). External intercostal inspiratory activity was consistently greater in the areas with a greater inspiratory advantage (i.e. the dorsal aspect of the rostral segments) than in the areas with a smaller inspiratory advantage, and internal intercostal expiratory activity was invariably greatest in the areas with the greatest expiratory advantage (i.e. the dorsal aspect of the caudal segments). 4. This topographic distribution of neural drive confers to the external intercostal muscles an inspiratory action on the lung during breathing and to the internal interosseous intercostals an expiratory action.","['Animals', 'Apnea', 'Dogs', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Electromyography', 'Electrophysiology', 'Hypercapnia', 'Intercostal Muscles', 'Pressure', 'Respiration, Artificial', 'Respiratory Mechanics']",10373710,"[['B01.050'], ['C08.618.085', 'C23.888.852.130'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.750.250.216.200'], ['E05.723.402'], ['E01.370.405.255', 'E01.370.530.255'], ['H01.158.344.528', 'H01.158.782.236'], ['C23.888.852.544'], ['A02.633.567.900.500'], ['G01.374.715'], ['E02.041.625', 'E02.365.647.729', 'E02.880.820'], ['G09.772.705.700']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
Dysbiosis of the Gut Microbiome is associated with Tumor Biomarkers in Lung Cancer.,"Lung cancer is a malignancy with high morbidity and mortality worldwide. More evidences indicated that gut microbiome plays an important role in the carcinogenesis and progression of cancers by metabolism, inflammation and immune response. However, the study about the characterizations of gut microbiome in lung cancer is limited. In this study, the fecal samples were collected from 16 healthy individuals and 30 lung cancer patients who were divided into 3 groups based on different tumor biomarkers (cytokeratin 19 fragment, neuron specific enolase and carcinoembryonic antigen, respectively) and were analyzed using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. Each lung cancer group has characterized gut microbial community and presents an elimination, low-density, and loss of bacterial diversity microbial ecosystem compared to that of the healthy control. The microbiome structures in family and genera levels are more complex and significantly varied from each group presenting more different and special pathogen microbiome such as Enterobacteriaceae, Streptococcus, Prevotella, etc and fewer probiotic genera including Blautia, Coprococcus, Bifidobacterium and Lachnospiraceae. The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and COG annotation demonstrated decreased abundance of some dominant metabolism-related pathways in the lung cancer. This study explores for the first time the features of gut microbiome in lung cancer patients and may provide new insight into the pathogenesis of lung cancer system, with the implication that gut microbiota may serve as a microbial marker and contribute to the derived metabolites, development and differentiation in lung cancer system.","['Aged', 'Bacteria', 'Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Dysbiosis', 'Feces', 'Female', 'Gastrointestinal Microbiome', 'Humans', 'Lung Neoplasms', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'RNA, Ribosomal, 16S']",31595156,"[['M01.060.116.100'], ['B03'], ['D23.101.140'], ['C23.550.308'], ['A12.459'], ['G06.591.375', 'G16.500.275.157.049.100.500.375', 'N06.230.124.049.100.500.250'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C04.588.894.797.520', 'C08.381.540', 'C08.785.520'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['D13.444.735.686.670']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Health Care [N]']",1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
Male Urethral Stricture: American Urological Association Guideline.,"PURPOSE: The purpose of this Guideline is to provide a clinical framework for the diagnosis and treatment of male urethral stricture.MATERIALS AND METHODS: A systematic review of the literature using the Pubmed, Embase, and Cochrane databases (search dates 1/1/1990 to 12/1/2015) was conducted to identify peer-reviewed publications relevant to the diagnosis and treatment of urethral stricture. The review yielded an evidence base of 250 articles after application of inclusion/exclusion criteria. These publications were used to create the Guideline statements. Evidence-based statements of Strong, Moderate, or Conditional Recommendation were developed based on benefits and risks/burdens to patients. Additional guidance is provided as Clinical Principles and Expert Opinion when insufficient evidence existed.RESULTS: The Panel identified the most common scenarios seen in clinical practice related to the treatment of urethral strictures. Guideline statements were developed to aid the clinician in optimal evaluation, treatment, and follow-up of patients presenting with urethral strictures.CONCLUSIONS: Successful treatment of male urethral stricture requires selection of the appropriate endoscopic or surgical procedure based on anatomic location, length of stricture, and prior interventions. Routine use of imaging to assess stricture characteristics will be required to apply evidence based recommendations, which must be applied with consideration of patient preferences and personal goals. As scientific knowledge relevant to urethral stricture evolves and improves, the strategies presented here will be amended to remain consistent with the highest standards of clinical care.","['Endoscopy', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Practice Guidelines as Topic', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Societies, Medical', 'Treatment Outcome', 'United States', 'Urethral Stricture', 'Urologic Surgical Procedures, Male', 'Urology']",27497791,"[['E01.370.388.250', 'E04.502.250'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.249', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.350', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.350'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['N04.761.700.350.650', 'N05.700.350.650'], ['E05.318.308.980.438.475.456.500', 'N05.715.360.300.800.438.375.364.500', 'N06.850.520.308.980.438.475.364.500'], ['N03.540.828.589'], ['E01.789.800', 'N04.761.559.590.800', 'N05.715.360.575.575.800'], ['Z01.107.567.875'], ['C12.777.767.700.700', 'C13.351.968.767.700.700'], ['E04.950.774.860'], ['H02.403.810.860']]","['Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]']",0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1

Massive Chondroblastoma of the Talus: Treatment With En Bloc Talectomy and Tibiocalcaneal Arthrodesis: Long-Term Follow-up of a Case.,"Chondroblastomas are benign bone tumors that are usually located at epiphyseal regions of long bones, and are rarely located at the talus. The usual treatment consists of curettage and filling of the bone defect with bone either bone grafts or some other material, such as cement. The authors present a case of a massive chondroblastma of the talus, extending outside of bone boundaries and with a huge soft tissue mass and invasion of the adjacent calcaneus.

Alternative pathways of apoptosis induced by methylprednisolone and valinomycin analyzed by flow cytometry.,"Apoptosis of murine thymocytes induced by either methylprednisolone or valinomycin was studied by flow cytometry. The apoptosis induced by methylprednisolone followed three stages: an initial decrease in cell volume, indicated by a fall in forward scatter accompanied by faint ethidium bromide staining, a second stage in which the cells became brightly stained by ethidium bromide, and a final stage when the cells were apparently less fluorescent as the nuclei disintegrated into apoptotic bodies. As the forward scatter of cells decreased there was a simultaneous depolarization of the cells and an elevation of intracellular calcium. These early changes preceded the fragmentation of the DNA which also preceded the intense staining of the cells by ethidium bromide. Methylprednisolone-induced apoptosis was inhibited by low concentrations (1 x 10(-7) M) of valinomycin and nonactin, neither of which could themselves induce apoptosis at these low concentrations. Cadmidazolium and cycloheximide arrested the program at an early stage. Okadaic acid allowed volume loss and ethidium bromide staining to proceed in the absence of DNA fragmentation. At high concentrations (1 x 10(-5) M) valinomycin induced a form of apoptosis, but nonactin only caused the cells to fragment. The valinomycin-induced apoptosis, although it involved the degradation of DNA and the disintegration of the nuclei into apoptotic bodies, differed from the methylprednisolone apoptosis as it did not involve a decrease of cell volume and was not inhibited by cycloheximide or affected by okadaic acid.","['Animals', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Apoptosis', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cycloheximide', 'DNA Damage', 'Ethers, Cyclic', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Imidazoles', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Macrolides', 'Male', 'Methylprednisolone', 'Mice', 'Okadaic Acid', 'Thymus Gland', 'Valinomycin']",8375466,"[['B01.050'], ['D27.505.954.122.085'], ['G04.146.954.035'], ['A11.251'], ['D03.383.621.808.240'], ['G05.200'], ['D02.355.291', 'D04.345.241'], ['E01.370.225.500.363.342', 'E01.370.225.500.386.350', 'E05.196.712.516.600.240.350', 'E05.200.500.363.342', 'E05.200.500.386.350', 'E05.242.363.342', 'E05.242.386.350'], ['D03.383.129.308'], ['E05.481'], ['D02.540.505', 'D02.540.576.500', 'D04.345.674.500'], ['D04.210.500.745.432.769.795.539'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500'], ['D02.355.291.705', 'D23.946.580.710'], ['A10.549.750', 'A15.382.520.604.750'], ['D04.345.566.297.500', 'D12.644.641.297.500']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Methotrexate leukoencephalopathy presenting as Kl?ver-Bucy syndrome and uncinate seizures.,"Methotrexate causes several biochemical changes that impact the nervous system. The neurotoxicity usually affects the cerebral white matter, causing a leukoencephalopathy that can be chronic and progressive with cognitive decline. A 15-year-old male developed olfactory seizures and behavioral abnormalities (hypersexuality, placidity, and memory disturbances) compatible with partial Kl?ver-Bucy syndrome after treatment for central nervous system leukemia with intraventricular methotrexate. A magnetic resonance imaging study revealed evidence of white matter disease affecting both temporal lobes. A brain biopsy revealed a necrotizing encephalopathy compatible with methotrexate-related white matter injury. It may be prudent to verify normal cerebrospinal fluid dynamics before the administration of intraventricular methotrexate in children with a history of central nervous system leukemia.","['Adolescent', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic', 'Brain', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Enzyme Inhibitors', 'Epilepsies, Partial', 'Humans', 'Kluver-Bucy Syndrome', 'Leukemia', 'Leukoencephalopathy, Progressive Multifocal', 'Male', 'Methotrexate']",11992760,"[['M01.060.057'], ['D27.505.519.186.144', 'D27.505.954.248.144', 'D27.888.569.042.030'], ['A08.186.211'], ['E01.171'], ['D27.505.519.389'], ['C10.228.140.490.360'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C10.228.140.380.326', 'F03.615.400.431'], ['C04.557.337'], ['C01.207.245.340.500', 'C01.207.399.750.500', 'C01.925.182.525.500', 'C01.925.256.721.500', 'C01.925.839.550', 'C10.228.140.430.520.750.500', 'C10.228.140.695.750', 'C10.228.228.245.340.500', 'C10.228.228.399.750.500', 'C10.314.450'], ['D03.633.100.733.631.192.500']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]']",1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
Influence of genetic variation in alcohol and aldehyde dehydrogenase on serotonin metabolism.,"The influence of genetic variation in alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH; EC 1.1.1.1) and aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH; EC 1.2.1.3) on the metabolic pattern of serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) in humans was examined from the relative urinary concentrations of the end products 5-hydroxyindole-3-acetic acid (5-HIAA) and 5-hydroxytryptophol (5-HTOL). Healthy Caucasian (Swedish) and Oriental (Chinese) subjects were genotyped for ADH2, ADH3 and ALDH2 by a PCR/SSCP technique. The 5-HTOL/5-HIAA ratios ranged between 0.9-9.4 pmol/nmol (4.4 +/- 1.8, mean +/- SD, n = 143). No significant difference in the 5-HT metabolic pattern was observed between Caucasians and Orientals (4.3 +/- 1.8 and 4.4 +/- 1.8 pmol/nmol, respectively), nor between any of the ADH2, ADH3 and ALDH2 genotypes. Despite the modulatory effects of genetic variation of these enzymes on ethanol metabolism, the present results indicate that the individual isozyme composition of ADH2, ADH3 and ALDH2 is not important for the metabolic pattern of 5-HT.","['Alcohol Dehydrogenase', 'Aldehyde Dehydrogenase', 'Asian Continental Ancestry Group', 'Ethanol', 'European Continental Ancestry Group', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Isoenzymes', 'Serotonin']",8035649,"[['D08.811.682.047.820.250'], ['D08.811.682.657.163.249'], ['M01.686.508.200'], ['D02.033.375'], ['M01.686.508.400'], ['G05.365'], ['G05.380'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D08.811.348', 'D12.776.800.300'], ['D02.092.211.215.801.852', 'D03.633.100.473.914.814', 'D23.469.050.650']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]']",0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
Maternal and neonatal red blood cell n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids inversely associate with infant whole-body fat mass assessed by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry.,"Research regarding polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) status and body composition in neonates is limited. This study tested the relationship between newborn docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) status and body composition. Healthy mothers and their term-born infants (n = 100) were studied within 1 month postpartum for anthropometry and whole-body composition using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Maternal and infant red blood cell (RBC) membrane PUFA profiles were measured using gas chromatography (expressed as percentage of total fatty acids). Data were grouped according to infant RBC DHA quartiles and tested for differences in n-3 status and infant body composition using mixed-model ANOVA, Spearman correlations, and regression analyses (P < 0.05). Mothers were 32.2 ± 4.6 years (mean ± SD) of age, infants (54% males) were 0.68 ± 0.23 month of age, and 80% exclusively breastfed. Infant RBC DHA (ranged 3.96% to 7.75% of total fatty acids) inversely associated with infant fat mass (r = -0.22, P = 0.03). Infant and maternal RBC n-6/n-3 PUFA ratio (r2 = 0.28, P = 0.043; r2 = 0.28, P = 0.041 respectively) were positively associated with fat mass. These results demonstrate that both maternal and infant long-chain PUFA status are associated with neonatal body composition. Novelty Our findings support an early window to further explore the relationship between infant n-3 PUFA status and body composition. Maternal and infant n-3 PUFA status is inversely related to neonatal whole-body fat mass. DHA appears to be the best candidate to test in the development of a lean body phenotype.","['Absorptiometry, Photon', 'Adipose Tissue', 'Adult', 'Body Composition', 'Docosahexaenoic Acids', 'Erythrocytes', 'Fatty Acids, Unsaturated', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Mothers']",31437414,"[['E01.370.350.700.024', 'E05.196.712.224.187'], ['A10.165.114'], ['M01.060.116'], ['G02.111.130', 'G03.180', 'G07.100.049'], ['D10.212.302.380.410.210', 'D10.251.355.337.250', 'D10.627.430.450.375'], ['A11.118.290', 'A11.443.240', 'A15.145.229.334'], ['D10.251.355'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.703.520'], ['F01.829.263.500.320.200', 'I01.880.853.150.500.340.270', 'M01.620.630']]","['Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]']",1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
Airway complications after lung transplantation: treatment and long-term outcome.,"BACKGROUND: Airway complications are a significant cause of morbidity after lung transplantation. Effective treatment reduces the impact of these complications.METHODS: Data from 123 lung (99 single, 24 bilateral) transplants were reviewed. Potential risk factors for airway complications were analyzed. Stenoses were treated with expanding metal (Gianturco) stents.RESULTS: Mean follow-up was 749 days. Thirty-five complications developed in 28 recipients (complication rate: 23.8%/anastomosis). Mean time to diagnosis was 47 days. Only Aspergillus infection and airway necrosis were significantly associated with development of complications (p < 0.00001 and p < 0.03, respectively). Stenosis was diagnosed an average of 42 days posttransplant. Average decline in forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) was 39%. Eighteen patients (13 single and 5 bilateral) required stent insertion. Mean increase in FEV1 poststenting was 87%. Two stent patients died from infectious complications. Six patients required further intervention. Long-term survival and FEV1 did not differ from nonstented patients.CONCLUSIONS: Aspergillus and airway necrosis are associated with the development of airway complications. Expanding metal stents are an effective long-term treatment.","['Bronchial Diseases', 'Constriction, Pathologic', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Lung Transplantation', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Risk Factors', 'Stents', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']",11269487,"[['C08.127'], ['C23.300.287'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.249', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.350', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.350'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E04.928.600.495', 'E04.936.450.495'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['E05.318.740.600.800.725', 'N05.715.350.200.700', 'N05.715.360.750.625.700.700', 'N06.850.490.625.750', 'N06.850.520.830.600.800.725'], ['E07.695.750'], ['G01.910.857'], ['E01.789.800', 'N04.761.559.590.800', 'N05.715.360.575.575.800']]","['Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
Postnatal changes in the overall postsynaptic currents evoked in CA1 pyramidal neurons of the rat hippocampus.,"Evoked fast postsynaptic currents (fPSCs) during the postnatal development of rats (postnatal day 6-70, P6-P70) were systematically examined in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons using whole-cell recordings with biocytin-filled electrodes. Focal stimulation of the stratum radiatum in the CA1 region elicited fPSCs in 80% of the neurons P6-7, 90% of P9-10, and 100% of > or =P11. In neurons P6-7, the fPSCs were exclusively inward and had multiple (on average 5.6) peaks. The fPSCs increased in amplitude with the growth of dendritic arborization, but decreased in the number of peaks. A distinct outward fPSC following the inward fPSC emerged in neurons > or =P11 and was abolished by bicuculline (50 microM). Bicuculline increased the amplitude and duration of the initial inward fPSC (fEPSC) in all age groups and characteristically recruited the polysynaptic second component of fEPSCs in neurons P11-P21. No spontaneous periodic inward current was detected in any age group after blocking GABAA receptors. The coapplication of DL-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid (AP5, 100 microM) with bicuculline did not eliminate the polysynaptic second component, but the second component was only elicited in slices in which the CA3 region was kept intact. Moreover, the bicuculline- and AP5-resistant second component was due to the burst activity of CA3 pyramidal neurons, which were excited through excitatory recurrents of the Schaffer collaterals. Plausible physiological functions of the generation of the second component in vivo were discussed.","['6-Cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione', 'Anesthetics, Local', 'Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'Bicuculline', 'Electrophysiology', 'Evoked Potentials', 'Excitatory Amino Acid Antagonists', 'Excitatory Postsynaptic Potentials', 'Female', 'GABA Antagonists', 'Hippocampus', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Lidocaine', 'Male', 'Patch-Clamp Techniques', 'Pyramidal Cells', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar']",12467875,"[['D03.633.100.857.160'], ['D27.505.696.277.100.200', 'D27.505.696.663.850.025', 'D27.505.954.427.210.100.200'], ['B01.050'], ['B01.050.050.282'], ['D03.132.098.077', 'D03.633.100.531.085.077'], ['H01.158.344.528', 'H01.158.782.236'], ['G07.265.216.500', 'G11.561.200.500'], ['D27.505.519.625.190.300', 'D27.505.696.577.190.300'], ['G04.580.887.249', 'G07.265.675.887.249', 'G07.265.880.750.199', 'G11.561.570.918.249', 'G11.561.830.750.199'], ['D27.505.519.625.240.300', 'D27.505.696.577.240.300'], ['A08.186.211.180.405', 'A08.186.211.200.885.287.500.345'], ['E05.481'], ['D02.065.199.092.500', 'D02.092.146.113.092.500'], ['E05.200.500.905', 'E05.242.800'], ['A08.675.790', 'A11.671.790'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700.900']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

Isolated adrenocorticotropic hormone deficiency presenting with hypercalcemia in a patient on long-term hemodialysis.,"The authors report on a 44-year-old female hemodialysis (HD) patient who presented with hypercalcemia secondary to isolated adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) deficiency. She had been suffering from nausea and abdominal pain caused by recurrent esophageal ulcer. Blood calcium (Ca) adjusted for serum albumin concentration was increased to 14.9 mg/dL (3.72 mmol/L) concurrently with fever and hypotension. Serum intact parathyroid hormone (PTH)-related peptide was not elevated, but serum intact PTH and 1,25-(OH)2 vitamin D3 were decreased to 31 pg/mL (ng/L) and 8.1 pg/mL (2.6 pmol/L), respectively. Endocrinologic examination found that plasma ACTH was reduced below 5.0 pg/mL (0.22 pmol/L). A single ACTH stimulation normally increased blood cortisol, whereas a single corticotropin-releasing hormone injection failed to increase plasma ACTH and cortisol.

[An experimental study on the therapeutic effects of eustachian tube surfactant in barotitis media].,"OBJECTIVE: To observe the effect of surfactant on eustachian tube (ET) on the opening of ET as well as it's therapeutic role in barotitis media (BM).METHOD: 50 guinea pigs were successfully established as BM models by stimulated ascending in altitude chamber. Parts of the models were treated with by middle ear flushing with nature ETS, artificial ETS, artificial phospholipid and saline, after which the eustachian tube pressure opening level (POL) of each group was tested. Others were injected with 1 ml artificial ETS in on side of the middle ear, and 1 ml of saline in the other served as control.RESULT: Natural ETS decreased the POL from 11.98 to 6.11 kPa (P < 0.01); Artificial ETS reduced the POL from 11.91 to 6.67 kPa (P < 0.01), there were no significant differences between the two groups. Artificial phospholipid decreased the POL from 11.86 to 8.61 kPa (P < 0.05), which was not as effective as natural ETS. While the POL of saline group remained unchanged. After one week of artificial ETS treatment, the congestion in drum membrane alleviated, the hearing threshold of ETS group improved and the effusion in tympanic cavity lessened.CONCLUSION: The results suggest that artificial ETS is as effective as nature ETS to facilitates the opening of eustachian tube. Artificial ETS may exert therapeutic effects on BM.","['Animals', 'Barotrauma', 'Eustachian Tube', 'Female', 'Guinea Pigs', 'Male', 'Otitis Media', 'Surface-Active Agents']",15515553,"[['B01.050'], ['C26.120'], ['A09.246.397.369'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.550'], ['C09.218.705.663'], ['D27.720.877']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]']",1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Purification of plasma membrane from Acanthamoeba castellanii.,"A simple method for isolation of plasma membrane from Acanthamoeba using self-generating gradients of Percoll is described. To obtain a membrane marker, intact amoebae were radioiodinated and the distribution of the radiolabel was followed through the plasma membrane isolation procedure. The purity of isolated plasma membrane was assessed by enrichment of radiolabel, by electron microscopy, and by enzymatic assays for contaminating membranes. As judged from enrichment of radiolabel, a 37-fold purification of plasma membrane was obtained. We estimate that 80% of the total protein was from plasma membrane and 10% from membrane-associated actin.","['Acanthamoeba', 'Actins', 'Animals', 'Cell Fractionation', 'Cell Membrane', 'Centrifugation, Density Gradient', 'Membrane Proteins', 'Microscopy, Electron']",3184000,"[['B01.046.500.100.075.080'], ['D05.750.078.730.250', 'D12.776.210.500.100', 'D12.776.220.525.255'], ['B01.050'], ['E05.242.251'], ['A11.284.149'], ['E05.181.724.336', 'E05.196.941.336'], ['D12.776.543'], ['E01.370.350.515.402', 'E05.595.402']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Diagnosis of congenital toxoplasmosis at birth: what is the value of testing for IgM and IgA?,"UNLABELLED: Recommendations vary on the best combination of tests to use for the diagnosis of subclinical congenital toxoplasmosis at birth. The diagnostic accuracy of IgM and IgA tests was assessed in the context of routine clinical practice on 233 newborns with congenital toxoplasmosis and 661 healthy controls. IgM/IgA sensibility and specificity were compared in cord and postnatal samples. Both tests were considerably more specific in neonatal blood (IgM: 98%; IgA: 100%) than in cordblood (IgM: 85%; IgA: 88%). Sensitivity for IgM and IgA was not significantly different in neonatal blood (61% and 60%, respectively) and cord blood (67% and 54%, respectively). Combining IgM and IgA increased the overall sensitivity to 73% without any significant loss in specificity (98%). The influence of the date of maternal infection on the sensitivity and negative predictive value was also clearly demonstrated.CONCLUSION: Because of their relatively low cost compared to more sophisticated methods, IgM and IgA tests should remain the main method for the routine diagnosis of congenital toxoplasmosis although follow up is essential to identify the Ca. 25% of infected children who are missed at birth on the basis of these tests.","['Agglutination Tests', 'Female', 'Fetal Blood', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin A', 'Immunoglobulin M', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Complications, Infectious', 'Prospective Studies', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Toxoplasmosis, Congenital']",10445343,"[['E01.370.225.812.735.050', 'E05.200.812.735.050', 'E05.478.594.760.050'], ['A12.207.152.200', 'A15.145.300', 'A16.378.200'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D12.776.124.486.485.114.619.026', 'D12.776.124.790.651.114.619.026', 'D12.776.377.715.548.114.619.026'], ['D12.776.124.486.485.114.619.574', 'D12.776.124.790.651.114.619.574', 'D12.776.377.715.548.114.619.574'], ['M01.060.703.520'], ['G08.686.784.769'], ['C01.674', 'C13.703.700'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.625', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.650', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.650'], ['E05.318.370.800', 'E05.318.740.872', 'G17.800', 'N05.715.360.325.700', 'N05.715.360.750.725', 'N06.850.520.445.800', 'N06.850.520.830.872'], ['C01.207.205.300.900', 'C01.610.752.250.800.445', 'C10.228.228.205.300.900', 'C16.614.909']]","['Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Health Care [N]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0

The prevalence and the level distribution were significantly different from those of a normal donor population (p < 0.001). In myastenic patients, IgG-ACA bound negatively charged, but not zwitterionic, phospholipids.

The effects of the inotropic agent EMD 57033 on activation and relaxation kinetics in frog skinned skeletal muscle.,"The effect of the cardiotonic sensitizing drug EMD 57033 was studied in frog skinned skeletal muscle fibres at 12 degrees C to provide a baseline for skeletal muscle studies and for comparison with cardiac fibres. The activation and relaxation of fibres were induced by laser flash photolysis of the caged calcium NP-EGTA, and caged calcium chelator diazo-2 respectively. EMD 57033 (10 microM) slightly increased the rate of relaxation (rate constant k1 changing from 24.0 +/- 2.9 s-1 in control to 28.1 +/- 3.2 s-1) but had no significant effect on the rate of activation (k1 = 9.6 +/- 0.9 s-1 in control conditions, 9.7 +/- 1.6 s-1 with EMD 57033). The effect of the optical isomer of EMD 57033, EMD 57439, was examined on steady-state force and relaxation rate. EMD57439 (10 microM) slowed the rate of relaxation (k1 = 20.5 +/- 2.4 s-1) but had no effect on the maximal calcium-activated force whereas EMD 57033 increased it by 16.5 +/- 5.7%. These results are compared to earlier results from this laboratory in guinea-pig skinned trabeculae, and a possible model for the action of EMD 57033 whereby the drug enhances force per cross-bridge is discussed.","['Animals', 'Cardiotonic Agents', 'Chelating Agents', 'Diazonium Compounds', 'Egtazic Acid', 'Histological Techniques', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Kinetics', 'Muscle, Skeletal', 'Phenoxyacetates', 'Quinolines', 'Rana temporaria', 'Thiadiazines']",11417210,"[['B01.050'], ['D27.505.954.411.222', 'D27.720.799.080'], ['D27.505.519.914.500', 'D27.720.832.500'], ['D02.172.383'], ['D02.092.782.258.368.257', 'D02.241.081.018.269'], ['E01.370.225.750', 'E05.200.750'], ['E05.481'], ['G01.374.661', 'G02.111.490'], ['A02.633.567', 'A10.690.552.500'], ['D02.241.081.018.386.682', 'D02.241.511.316.682'], ['D03.633.100.810'], ['B01.050.150.900.090.180.708.420'], ['D02.886.665.785', 'D03.383.855.785']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Cutaneous collagenous vasculopathy associated with intravascular occlusive fibrin thrombi.,"Cutaneous collagenous vasculopathy (CCV) is a rare cutaneous microangiopathy that clinically resembles generalized essential telangiectasia with only 12 cases reported to date. The perivascular fibrosis is thought to be due to production of abnormal collagen by veil cells in the outer vessel walls as a result of unknown factors. This report is of an 84-year-old male with progressive telangiectasia. Biopsies showed characteristic features of CCV. In addition, there were multiple intravascular fibrin thrombi, some organizing and associated with endothelial cell hyperplasia with recanalization reminiscent of glomeruloid bodies and simulating reactive angioendotheliomatosis (RAE). Histochemically and ultrastructurally fibrin was noted within the vessel walls integrating into the fibrous tissue around the vessels; however, the patient had no evidence of coagulation disorder, cryoglobulinemia or cold agglutinemia. Immunofluorescence showed fibrinogen within the vessel walls but no immunoglobulins or C3. As well, there were minimal inflammatory cells. This suggests pauci-inflammatory injury to the endothelial cells by unknown angiogenic factors causing local intravascular fibrin thrombi with fibrin leaking and incorporating into the vessel walls, eventually leading to reparative perivascular fibrosis. This case suggests that some cases of CCV are related to a primary local intravascular occlusive thrombotic microangiopathy. However, the primary triggering factor causing the endothelial cell damage has yet to be elucidated.","['Aged, 80 and over', 'Fibrin', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Skin', 'Skin Diseases, Vascular', 'Thrombosis', 'Thrombotic Microangiopathies']",24350781,"[['M01.060.116.100.080'], ['D12.776.124.270'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['A17.815'], ['C17.800.862'], ['C14.907.355.830'], ['C15.378.140.855.925']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Diseases [C]']",1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
Assessment of Hurricane Ivan impact on chlorophyll-a in Pensacola Bay by MODIS 250 m remote sensing.,"The impact of Hurricane Ivan on water quality in Pensacola Bay was investigated by MODIS 250m remote sensing of chlorophyll-a concentrations at different time slots before and after the hurricane event. Before the hurricane, the mean chlorophyll-a in the Bay was 5.3 ìg/L. Heavy rainfall occurred during the hurricane landfall. The 48 h rainfall reached 40cm and the peak storm surge reached 3m on 9/16. After the rainstorm and during the storm surge on 9/17/2004, the mean chlorophyll-a concentration substantially increased to 14.7 ìg/L. 26.3% water area was in the poor-water-quality condition (chl-a>20 ìg/L). This indicates that heavy nutrient loads from urban stormwater runoff and storm-surge inundation simulated chlorophyll bloom. After the end of the storm surge on 9/18/2004, the mean chlorophyll dropped to 2.0 ìg/L, suggesting the effective flushing of polluted water from the bay to the Gulf of Mexico by the storm-surge. The good water quality condition lasted for almost several weeks after the storm surge. The peak river flow, arriving on the 4th day after the peak storm surge, did not alter the good water quality situation in the bay. This indicates that urban stormwater runoff rather than the river inflow is the major pollutant source for water quality in Pensacola Bay during the hurricane.","['Chlorophyll', 'Chlorophyll A', 'Cyclonic Storms', 'Environment', 'Eutrophication', 'Florida', 'Linear Models', 'Phytoplankton', 'Rain', 'Remote Sensing Technology', 'Water Pollutants, Chemical', 'Water Pollution, Chemical']",21272900,"[['D03.383.129.578.840.374', 'D03.633.400.909.374', 'D04.345.783.374'], ['D03.383.129.578.840.374.140', 'D03.633.400.909.374.140', 'D04.345.783.374.140'], ['G16.500.175.500', 'N06.230.100.230.100'], ['G16.500.275', 'N06.230'], ['G16.500.285'], ['Z01.107.567.875.750.350'], ['E05.318.740.500.500', 'E05.318.740.750.425', 'E05.599.835.750', 'N05.715.360.750.530.460', 'N05.715.360.750.695.460', 'N06.850.520.830.500.500', 'N06.850.520.830.750.425'], ['B05.080.500.600'], ['G16.500.175.859', 'G16.500.275.063.725.395', 'G16.500.750.775.450', 'N06.230.300.100.725.450', 'N06.230.520'], ['E01.370.520.750.500', 'E05.925.500', 'L01.178.847.675.500'], ['D27.888.284.903.655'], ['N06.850.460.790.410']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Information Science [L]']",0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,1

The changing panorama of cerebral palsy in Sweden 1954-1970. II. Analysis of the various syndromes.,"From an unselected series of 560 Swedish cases of cerebral palsy, born 1954-1970, various data of etiologic and pathogenetic interest were analyzed in detail. Untraceable and prenatal factors were found to dominate within the group of spastic hemiplegia. Placental dysfunction in small-for-date babies and severe asphyxia were thought to be the two main pathogenetic factors among the patients with spastic tetraplegia. In spite of a significant decrease in the number of low birth weight children within the group of spastic diplegia, this syndrome was still very characteristic for the child born immature. Ataxic diplegic forms were found to have greater pathogenic similarities to spastic diplegia than to simple ataxia. In two-thirds of the children the latter syndrome was characterized by normal pregnancy, delivery and birth weight and an untraceable (genetic?) factor. Dyskinetic syndromes were mostly encountered after perinatal asphyxia.","['Adolescent', 'Asphyxia Neonatorum', 'Ataxia', 'Athetosis', 'Birth Weight', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Hemiplegia', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Intelligence', 'Movement Disorders', 'Placenta Diseases', 'Pregnancy', 'Quadriplegia', 'Sweden']",1130175,"[['M01.060.057'], ['C16.614.092'], ['C10.597.350.090', 'C23.888.592.350.090'], ['C10.597.350.110', 'C23.888.592.350.110'], ['C23.888.144.186', 'E01.370.600.115.100.160.120.186', 'E05.041.124.160.750.149', 'G07.100.100.160.120.186', 'G07.345.249.314.120.186'], ['C10.228.140.140.254'], ['M01.060.406'], ['M01.060.406.448'], ['C10.597.622.295', 'C23.888.592.636.312'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.703'], ['M01.060.703.520'], ['F01.752.543'], ['C10.228.662'], ['C13.703.590'], ['G08.686.784.769'], ['C10.597.622.760', 'C23.888.592.636.786'], ['Z01.542.816.500']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Geographicals [Z]']",0,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1
Top-down protein identification/characterization of a priori unknown proteins via ion trap collision-induced dissociation and ion/ion reactions in a quadrupole/time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometer.,"The identification and characterization of a priori unknown proteins from an Escherichia coli (E. coli) soluble protein lysate using ion trap collision-induced dissociation of intact protein ions followed by ion/ion reactions in a quadrupole/time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometer is illustrated. The procedure involved the submission of uninterpreted product ion spectra to a peak-picking program and then to ProSightPTM for searching against an E. coli database. Examples are provided for the identification and characterization of both modified and unmodified unknown proteins with masses up to approximately 28 kDa. The availability of protein intact mass along with sequence information makes possible the characterization of proteins with post-translational modifications, such as disulfide linkages, as well as protein isoforms whose sequences are absent from a database, provided that a related form of the gene product is present in the database. This work demonstrates that the quadrupole/time-of-flight platform, in conjunction with ion-ion proton transfer reactions, can be adapted to obtain primary structure information from entire protein ions, rather than simply N- or C-terminal information from low mass-to-charge products, for proteins as large as several tens of kilodaltons.","['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Cell Extracts', 'Complex Mixtures', 'Databases, Protein', 'Escherichia coli', 'Escherichia coli Proteins', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry']",19199571,"[['G02.111.570.060', 'L01.453.245.667.060'], ['D20.777.162'], ['D20'], ['L01.313.500.750.300.188.400.300.750', 'L01.313.500.750.300.188.400.325.710', 'L01.470.750.750.300.750', 'L01.470.750.750.325.710'], ['B03.440.450.425.325.300', 'B03.660.250.150.180.100'], ['D12.776.097.275'], ['L01.453.245.667'], ['G02.111.660.871.790.600', 'G02.111.691.600', 'G03.734.871.790.600', 'G05.308.670.600'], ['E05.318.370.800', 'E05.318.740.872', 'G17.800', 'N05.715.360.325.700', 'N05.715.360.750.725', 'N06.850.520.445.800', 'N06.850.520.830.872'], ['E05.196.566.880']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]']",0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0
"Quantification of peroxynitrite, superoxide, and peroxyl radicals by a new spin trap hydroxylamine 1-hydroxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-4-oxo-piperidine.","The reactions of hydroxylamine 1-hydroxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-4-oxo-piperidine hydrochloride (TEMPONE-H) with peroxynitrite, superoxide and peroxyl radicals were studied.

Using TEMPONE-H the sensitivity in the detection of peroxynitrite or superoxide radical was about 10-fold higher than using the spin traps DMPO or TMIO. Thus, TEMPONE-H may be used as a spin trap in chemical and biological systems to quantify peroxynitrite and superoxide radical formation.","['Amidines', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide', 'Electron Spin Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Free Radicals', 'Kinetics', 'Molsidomine', 'Nitrates', 'Peroxides', 'Piperidines', 'Reactive Oxygen Species', 'Spin Labels', 'Superoxides', 'Triacetoneamine-N-Oxyl']",9020059,"[['D02.078'], ['D02.886.640.150'], ['E05.196.867.519.274'], ['D01.339', 'D02.389'], ['G01.374.661', 'G02.111.490'], ['D03.383.129.462.580.693.450', 'D03.383.533.640.362'], ['D01.248.497.158.606', 'D01.625.525.550', 'D02.583'], ['D01.248.497.158.685.750', 'D01.339.431.374', 'D01.650.550.750', 'D02.389.338'], ['D03.383.621'], ['D01.339.431', 'D01.650.775'], ['D02.389.678'], ['D01.248.497.158.685.750.850', 'D01.339.431.374.850', 'D01.650.550.750.800', 'D02.389.338.732'], ['D02.389.678.900', 'D03.383.621.808.930', 'D03.661.243.930']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Host factors that interact with the pestivirus N-terminal protease, Npro, are components of the ribonucleoprotein complex.","UNLABELLED: The viral N-terminal protease N(pro) of pestiviruses counteracts cellular antiviral defenses through inhibition of IRF3. Here we used mass spectrometry to identify a new role for N(pro) through its interaction with over 55 associated proteins, mainly ribosomal proteins and ribonucleoproteins, including RNA helicase A (DHX9), Y-box binding protein (YBX1), DDX3, DDX5, eIF3, IGF2BP1, multiple myeloma tumor protein 2, interleukin enhancer binding factor 3 (IEBP3), guanine nucleotide binding protein 3, and polyadenylate-binding protein 1 (PABP-1). These are components of the translation machinery, ribonucleoprotein particles (RNPs), and stress granules. Significantly, we found that stress granule formation was inhibited in MDBK cells infected with a noncytopathic bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) strain, Kyle. However, ribonucleoproteins binding to N(pro) did not inhibit these proteins from aggregating into stress granules. N(pro) interacted with YBX1 though its TRASH domain, since the mutant C112R protein with an inactive TRASH domain no longer redistributed to stress granules. Interestingly, RNA helicase A and La autoantigen relocated from a nuclear location to form cytoplasmic granules with N(pro). To address a proviral role for N(pro) in RNP granules, we investigated whether N(pro) affected RNA interference (RNAi), since interacting proteins are involved in RISC function during RNA silencing. Using glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) silencing with small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) followed by Northern blotting of GAPDH, expression of N(pro) had no effect on RNAi silencing activity, contrasting with other viral suppressors of interferon. We propose that N(pro) is involved with virus RNA translation in the cytoplasm for virus particle production, and when translation is inhibited following stress, it redistributes to the replication complex.IMPORTANCE: Although the pestivirus N-terminal protease, N(pro), has been shown to have an important role in degrading IRF3 to prevent apoptosis and interferon production during infection, the function of this unique viral protease in the pestivirus life cycle remains to be elucidated. We used proteomic mass spectrometry to identify novel interacting proteins and have shown that N(pro) is present in ribosomal and ribonucleoprotein particles (RNPs), indicating a translational role in virus particle production. The virus itself can prevent stress granule assembly from these complexes, but this inhibition is not due to N(pro). A proviral role to subvert RNA silencing through binding of these host RNP proteins was not identified for this viral suppressor of interferon.","['Animals', 'Diarrhea Virus 1, Bovine Viral', 'Host-Pathogen Interactions', 'Humans', 'Peptide Hydrolases', 'Pestivirus Infections', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Ribonucleoproteins', 'Ribosomal Proteins', 'Viral Proteins']",24965446,"[['B01.050'], ['B04.820.578.344.700.150.100'], ['G06.462', 'G16.527.200'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D08.811.277.656'], ['C01.925.782.350.675'], ['G02.111.679', 'G03.808'], ['G02.111.570.820.709.610'], ['D12.776.157.725.500', 'D12.776.664.962.500'], ['D12.776.835'], ['D12.776.964']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Diseases [C]']",0,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Salivary lipid peroxidation and total sialic acid levels during healthy gestation and postpartum: a longitudinal study.,"OBJECTIVES: This study investigated salivary lipid peroxidation (LPO) as an oxidative stress marker and salivary total sialic acid (TSA) as an inflammatory response during gestation and postpartum.DESIGN AND METHODS: Salivary LPO and TSA levels, using the Ledwozyw and Warren methods respectively, were obtained in healthy pregnant women followed up during gestation and 6-8 weeks postpartum, and in healthy non-pregnant controls. All were with good oral health.RESULTS: LPO was significantly higher than controls during all trimesters and postpartum and in the second trimester than in the third trimester and postpartum. TSA in the second trimester was significantly higher than in any other group. First trimester levels were significantly higher than postpartum . Oral health indices remained within normal levels for the duration.CONCLUSION: The salivary LPO profile followed plasma gestation and postpartum profiles in the literature but the salivary TSA differed in that after the 2nd trimester, rather than persisting, it decreased.","['Adult', 'Female', 'Health', 'Humans', 'Lipid Peroxidation', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'N-Acetylneuraminic Acid', 'Postpartum Period', 'Pregnancy', 'Saliva', 'Young Adult']",19896477,"[['M01.060.116'], ['N01.400'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['G02.111.515', 'G03.295.531.587'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.500'], ['D02.241.081.844.562.668.050', 'D02.241.511.902.562.668.050', 'D09.067.687.668.030', 'D09.811.589.668.030'], ['G08.686.702'], ['G08.686.784.769'], ['A12.200.666'], ['M01.060.116.815']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
Effect of voluntary respiratory efforts on breath-holding time.,"INTRODUCTION: Near the end of a maximal voluntary breath-hold, re-inhalation of the expired gas allows an additional period of breath-holding, indicating that the breaking point does not depend solely on chemical drive. We hypothesized that afferents from respiratory muscle and/or chest wall are significant in breath-holding.METHODS: Nineteen normal adults breathed room air through a mouthpiece connected to a pneumotachograph and were instructed to breath-hold with and without voluntary regular respiratory efforts against an occluded airway.RESULTS: Fifty one trials with and 53 without respiratory efforts were analyzed. The mean number of efforts per minute was 19+/-2.3 and the mean lowest airway pressure (P(aw)) -16.6+/-5.4 cmH(2)O. Breath-holding time (BHT) did not differ without (33.0+/-18.2 s) and with (29.3+/-12.3 s) efforts. In five patients arterial blood gasses were measured before and at the end of breath-holding and they did not differ between trials without and with efforts, indicating similar chemical drive. Our results suggest that afferents from respiratory muscle and/or chest wall are not the major determinants of BHT.","['Adaptation, Physiological', 'Adult', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Oxygen Consumption', 'Respiration', 'Respiratory Function Tests', 'Respiratory Muscles', 'Time Factors']",17324641,"[['G07.025', 'G16.012.500'], ['M01.060.116'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['G03.680'], ['G09.772.705'], ['E01.370.386.700'], ['A02.633.567.900'], ['G01.910.857']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
The mTOR inhibitor AZD8055 overcomes tamoxifen resistance in breast cancer cells by down-regulating HSPB8.,"Tamoxifen, an important endocrine therapeutic agent, is widely used for the treatment of estrogen receptor positive (ER+) breast cancer. However, de novo or acquired resistance prevents patients from benefitting from endocrine approaches and necessitates alternative treatments. In this study, we report that small heat protein beta-8 (HSPB8) may serve as an important molecule in tamoxifen resistance. HSPB8 expression is enhanced in MCF-7 cells resistant to tamoxifen (MCF-7/R) compared to parent cells. Moreover, high expression of HSPB8 associates with poor prognosis in ER+ breast cancer patients but not in patients without classification. Stimulating ER signaling by heterogeneous expression of ERa or 17â-estradiol promotes HSPB8 expression and reduces the cell population in G1 phase. In contrast, blockage of ER signaling by tamoxifen down-regulates the expression of HSPB8. In addition, knocking down HSPB8 by specific siRNAs induces significant cell cycle arrest at G1 phase. AZD8055 was found to be more potent against the proliferation of MCF-7/R cells than that of parent cells, which was associated with down-regulation of HSPB8. We found that the anti-proliferative activity of AZD8055 was positively correlated with the HSPB8 expression level in ER+ breast cancer cells. Thus, AZD8055 was able to overcome tamoxifen resistance in breast cancer cells, and the expression of HSPB8 may predict the efficacy of AZD8055 in ER+ breast cancer. This hypothesis deserves further investigation.","['Antineoplastic Agents', 'Breast Neoplasms', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Down-Regulation', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Estrogen Receptor alpha', 'G1 Phase Cell Cycle Checkpoints', 'Heat-Shock Proteins', 'Humans', 'Molecular Chaperones', 'Morpholines', 'Prognosis', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors', 'Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases', 'Tamoxifen']",29345254,"[['D27.505.954.248'], ['C04.588.180', 'C17.800.090.500'], ['A11.251.210.190', 'A11.251.860.180'], ['G02.111.240', 'G05.308.200', 'G07.690.773.937'], ['G07.690.773.984.395'], ['D12.776.826.750.350.174'], ['G04.144.109.249', 'G04.144.500.320.500'], ['D12.776.580.216'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D12.776.580'], ['D03.383.533.640'], ['E01.789'], ['D27.505.519.389.755'], ['D08.811.913.696.620.682.700'], ['D08.811.913.696.620.682.700.931', 'D12.776.476.925'], ['D02.455.426.559.389.150.700.900']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

"Relative frequencies of Alzheimer disease, Lewy body, vascular and frontotemporal dementia, and hippocampal sclerosis in the State of Florida Brain Bank.","Alzheimer disease (AD) is the most common dementing illness in the elderly, but there is equivocal evidence regarding the frequency of other disorders such as Lewy body disease (LBD), vascular dementia (VaD), frontotemporal dementia (FTD), and hippocampal sclerosis (HS). This ambiguity may be related to factors such as the age and gender of subjects with dementia. Therefore, the objective of this study was to calculate the relative frequencies of AD, LBD, VaD, FTD, and HS among 382 subjects with dementia from the State of Florida Brain Bank and to study the effect of age and gender on these frequencies. AD was the most frequent pathologic finding (77%), followed by LBD (26%), VaD (18%), HS (13%), and FTD (5%). Mixed pathology was common: Concomitant AD was present in 66% of LBD patients, 77% of VaD patients, and 66% of HS patients. The relative frequency of VaD increased with age, whereas the relative frequencies of FTD and LBD declined with age. Males were overrepresented among those with LBD, whereas females were overrepresented among AD subjects with onset age over 70 years.

[Update on the diagnosis and therapy of blood-transmitted occupational infections].,"The Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection, Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) infection and Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) infection are the most important blood borne occupational viral infection. Estimates of the prevalence of HIV infection in Italy is between 0.24 and 0.26%. The implementation of HIV screening strategies in the general population will decrease the proportion of patients with unknown HIV serostatus and the improvement of anti HIV therapie will decrease the proportion of HIV infected patients with detectable viraemia. The increate sensitivity of HBVDNA assays will prompt the definition of cut off levels for the definition of the infectivity of HBsAg positive health workers. The availability of highly effective and well tollerate oral antivirals could increase the proportion of treatable HBsAg positive health workers. The highly elevated success rates in the treatment of acute HCV infection will support strategies aimed at an early identification of occupational HCV infections. The tailoring of anti HCV schedules allows to optimize anti HCV treatment of health workers with chronic hepatitis C and the availability of new anti HCV will open an horizon of success in the treatment of chronic hepatitis C in health workers.","['Blood-Borne Pathogens', 'Communicable Diseases', 'HIV Infections', 'Hepatitis B', 'Hepatitis C', 'Humans', 'Occupational Diseases']",21061703,"[['B05.155'], ['C01.221', 'C23.550.291.531'], ['C01.221.250.875', 'C01.221.812.640.400', 'C01.778.640.400', 'C01.925.782.815.616.400', 'C01.925.813.400', 'C20.673.480'], ['C01.221.250.500', 'C01.925.256.430.400', 'C01.925.440.435', 'C06.552.380.705.437'], ['C01.221.250.750', 'C01.925.440.440', 'C01.925.782.350.350', 'C06.552.380.705.440'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C24']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]']",0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Ce6-C6-TPZ co-loaded albumin nanoparticles for synergistic combined PDT-chemotherapy of cancer.,"Photodynamic therapy (PDT), as an essential tumor treatment method, has received great attention; however, there are still some challenges such as hydrophobicity of most of the photosensitizers, safety of in vivo transport, and characteristics of oxygen consumption. Herein, we used albumin as the nanocarrier for the loading of Chlorin e6 (Ce6) photosensitizer. In the meantime, tirapazaming (TPZ) was co-loaded onto the nanocomposite, which could be activated by hypoxia caused by PDT for enhanced therapy. Considering the over irradiation problem, a strategy for measuring PDT degree by ratio fluorescence was utilized. The PDT monitoring design relies on ratio emissions of C6 (Coumarin 6) and Ce6 molecules since the red emission of Ce6 is dependent on the PDT capability. Based on the characterization of the albumin nanocomposites, we further explored the combined therapy effect at both the in vitro and in vivo levels and attained the corresponding results.","['Animals', 'Cattle', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival', 'Coumarins', 'Humans', 'Light', 'Liver', 'Mice', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Nanoparticles', 'Neoplasms', 'Photochemotherapy', 'Photosensitizing Agents', 'Porphyrins', 'Serum Albumin, Bovine', 'Thiazoles', 'Tirapazamine', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",31483422,"[['B01.050'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.500.380.271'], ['A11.251.210.190', 'A11.251.860.180'], ['G04.346'], ['D03.383.663.283.446', 'D03.633.100.150.446'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['G01.358.500.505.650', 'G01.590.540', 'G01.750.250.650', 'G01.750.770.578'], ['A03.620'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500'], ['E01.370.350.515.395', 'E05.595.395'], ['J01.637.512.600'], ['C04'], ['E02.186.500', 'E02.319.685', 'E02.774.722'], ['D27.505.954.444.600', 'D27.505.954.600.710'], ['D03.383.129.578.840.500', 'D03.633.400.909.500', 'D04.345.783.500', 'D23.767.727'], ['D12.776.034.841.540', 'D12.776.124.727.875'], ['D02.886.675', 'D03.383.129.708'], ['D03.383.931.867'], ['E04.936.864']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]', 'Diseases [C]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
Bone marrow declines as a site of B-cell precursor differentiation with age: relationship to thymus involution.,"The rearrangement of immunoglobulin genes in B-lymphocyte precursors requires the expression of the recombination activating genes (Rag), which leads to the generation of a highly diverse B-cell repertoire. We can use the level of Rag-1 mRNA in the bone marrow as an index of its capacity to support the maturation of B lymphocytes as all detectable bone marrow Rag-1 mRNA is expressed by B-cell precursors. In mouse bone marrow, Rag-1 mRNA increases during the first 2 months of life to reach its maximal level at 2 months of age. This level is maintained until 5 months of age and thereafter declines to a minimum level by 10 months of age. Thus, bone marrow Rag-1 mRNA is highest at the time when thymic function is maximal in euthymic mice. An association between thymic activity and bone marrow Rag-1 gene expression was supported by showing a low level of bone marrow Rag-1 mRNA in athymic nude mice at an age when this gene is maximally expressed in euthymic mice. Another characteristic of B cells in nude mice is their preferential rearrangement of diversity region (D)-proximal heavy-chain variable region (VH) genes. We demonstrated that injection of syngeneic splenic T cells into nude mice not only stimulates an increase in Rag-1 mRNA in their bone marrow B-cell precursors but also restores their random use of VH genes. Most interestingly, injection of supernatant medium from phytohemagglutinin-activated splenic T-cell cultures from young euthymic mice also induces both Rag-1 mRNA in bone marrow B-cell precursors and random use of VH genes. These findings suggest that thymic function can regulate both Rag-1 gene expression and VH gene use by bone marrow B-cell precursors.","['Aging', 'Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Base Sequence', 'Bone Marrow', 'DNA Primers', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells', 'Homeodomain Proteins', 'Lymphocyte Transfusion', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Nude', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'Proteins', 'RNA, Messenger', 'Thymus Gland', 'Transplantation, Isogeneic']",7991570,"[['G07.345.124'], ['B01.050'], ['A11.063.438', 'A11.118.637.555.567.562', 'A15.145.229.637.555.567.562', 'A15.382.032.438', 'A15.382.490.555.567.562'], ['G02.111.570.080', 'G05.360.080', 'L01.453.245.667.080'], ['A15.382.216'], ['D13.695.578.424.450.275', 'D27.720.470.530.600.223.600'], ['G05.297'], ['G05.344'], ['A11.148.378', 'A11.872.378', 'A15.378.316.378'], ['D12.776.260.400'], ['E02.095.135.140.425.445'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500'], ['B01.050.050.199.520.520.338', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500.400.338'], ['B01.050.050.199.520.520.420', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500.400.420'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500.550.500'], ['L01.453.245.667'], ['E05.393.620.500'], ['G02.111.660.871', 'G03.734.871', 'G05.297.670'], ['D12.776'], ['D13.444.735.544'], ['A10.549.750', 'A15.382.520.604.750'], ['E04.936.864.700']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Back pain management: a patient satisfaction study of services.,"The objectives of this study were to assess patient satisfaction with the current services provided for back pain, and to increase the level of understanding from the patients' perspective on beliefs about their back pain and how it affects their daily life. The study was conducted in two parts combining both quantitative and qualitative methodology. The main findings in the study revealed a high level of satisfaction with the services provided by the physiotherapy department and mixed levels of satisfaction with the GP. The GP was seen to be an expert yet failed to exhibit up-to-date knowledge about the causes and treatments for back pain. The issue of locus of control was a dominant theme throughout the study and those with stronger internal beliefs had a more positive outlook.

Integrating social epidemiology into public health research and practice for maternal depression.,"The impact of maternal depression on women and their families has been well documented. Given the prevalence and impact of this problem, one important strategy is to strengthen and expand our public health approaches. Although principles of social epidemiology are increasingly used in the field of maternal and child health, few public health efforts to address maternal mental health have incorporated ecosocial frameworks such as community connectedness, quality of social relationships, and social capital. One method to augment current public health approaches to maternal depression is through the incorporation of a perspective focusing on community, cohesion, group membership, and connectedness--a concept often described as social capital. We describe the relevance of this ecosocial perspective for mental health promotion programs for mothers.","['Biomedical Research', 'Depression, Postpartum', 'Female', 'Health Promotion', 'Humans', 'Interpersonal Relations', 'Mothers', 'Public Health Practice', 'Social Support']",21493925,"[['H01.770.644.145'], ['C13.703.844.253', 'F03.600.300.350'], ['I02.233.332.445', 'N02.421.726.407.579'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['F01.829.401'], ['F01.829.263.500.320.200', 'I01.880.853.150.500.340.270', 'M01.620.630'], ['N06.850.780'], ['I01.880.853.500.600']]","['Disciplines and Occupations [H]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Named Groups [M]']",0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0
Increased ratio of rapsyn to ACh receptor stabilizes postsynaptic receptors at the mouse neuromuscular synapse.,"The metabolic turnover of nicotinic ACh receptors (AChR) at the neuromuscular synapse is regulated over a tenfold range by innervation status, muscle electrical activity and neural agrin, but the downstream effector of such changes has not been defined. The AChR-associated protein rapsyn is essential for forming AChR clusters during development. Here, rapsyn was tagged with enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) to begin to probe its influence at the adult synapse. In C2 myotubes, rapsyn-EGFP participated with AChR in agrin-induced AChR cluster formation. When electroporated into the tibialis anterior muscle of young adult mice, rapsyn-EGFP accumulated in discrete subcellular structures, many of which colocalized with Golgi markers, consistent with the idea that rapsyn assembles with AChR in the exocytic pathway. Rapsyn-EGFP also targeted directly to the postsynaptic membrane where it occupied previously vacant rapsyn binding sites, thereby increasing the rapsyn to AChR ratio.

The grapefruit flavanone naringin protects against the radiation-induced genomic instability in the mice bone marrow: a micronucleus study.,"The effect of various doses, viz. 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6 and 8 mg/kg body weight of naringin (NIN) (a citrus flavanone) was studied on the alteration in the radiation-induced micronucleated polychromatic (MPCE) and normochromatic (MNCE) erythrocytes in mouse bone marrow exposed to 2 Gy of 60Co gamma-radiation. The treatment of mice with various doses of NIN before exposure to 2 Gy resulted in a significant decline in the frequency of MPCE when compared to the non-drug-treated irradiated control. However, the greatest reduction in MPCE was observed for 2mg/kg body weight NIN, accompanied by a highest PCE/NCE ratio when compared with the non-drug-treated irradiated control. Therefore, further studies were carried out using this dose of NIN, where the animals were administered with 2mg/kg body weight of NIN before exposure to 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 3 and 4 Gy of gamma-radiation. The frequency of MPCE and MNCE increased in a dose-dependent manner in both the non-drug-treated irradiated control and NIN-pretreated irradiated groups up to a dose of 2 Gy, while a further increase in the irradiation dose resulted in a significant decline in MPCE and MNCE frequencies in both groups. Pretreatment of mice with 2mg/kg body weight of NIN resulted in a significant decline in the frequencies of MPCE and MNCE. NIN treatment not only reduced the frequency of MPCE with one micronucleus, but also of MPCE with multiple micronuclei (MN), indicating its ability to reduce complex chromosome aberrations. Conversely, the PCE/NCE ratio declined in a dose-dependent manner in both groups. The treatment of mice with NIN before exposure to different doses of gamma-radiation resulted in the inhibition in this decline in the PCE/NCE ratio. Our study demonstrates that NIN is able to protect mouse bone marrow cells against the radiation-induced DNA damage and decline in the cell proliferation as observed by a reduction in the micronucleus frequency and an increase in PCE/NCE ratio, respectively, in the NIN-pretreated irradiated group.","['Animals', 'Antioxidants', 'Bone Marrow', 'DNA Damage', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Erythrocytes', 'Flavanones', 'Flavonoids', 'Fruit', 'Gamma Rays', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Micronuclei, Chromosome-Defective', 'Radiation-Protective Agents']",12160890,"[['B01.050'], ['D27.505.519.217', 'D27.505.696.706.125', 'D27.720.799.047'], ['A15.382.216'], ['G05.200'], ['E05.799.513.500', 'G01.750.740.500', 'G04.712.500', 'G07.225', 'G07.738.500', 'N06.850.810.250.180'], ['A11.118.290', 'A11.443.240', 'A15.145.229.334'], ['D03.383.663.283.266.450.252', 'D03.633.100.150.266.450.252'], ['D03.383.663.283.266.450', 'D03.633.100.150.266.450'], ['A18.024.500', 'G07.203.300.562', 'J02.500.562'], ['G01.358.500.505.300', 'G01.750.250.300', 'G01.750.750.400'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500'], ['A11.284.430.106.570', 'A11.284.430.214.190.875.117.570', 'C23.550.210.570', 'G05.365.590.175.570'], ['D27.505.696.706.776', 'D27.720.799.763']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]', 'Diseases [C]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0
Why Public Comments Matter: The Case of the National Institutes of Health Policy on Single Institutional Review Board Review of Multicenter Studies.,"PURPOSE: In 2014, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) requested public comments on a draft policy requiring NIH-funded, U.S.-based investigators to use a single institutional review board (sIRB) for ethical review of multicenter studies. The authors conducted a directed content analysis and qualitative summary of the comments and discuss how they shaped the final policy.METHOD: Two reviewers independently assessed support for the policy from a review of comments on the draft policy in 2016. A reviewer conducted an open text review to identify prespecified and additional comment themes. A second researcher reviewed 20% of comments; discrepancies were resolved through discussion.RESULTS: The NIH received 167 comments: 65% (108/167) supportive of the policy, 23% (38/167) not supportive, and 12% (21/167) not indicating support. Clarifications or changes to the policy were suggested in 102/167 comments (61%). Criteria for selecting sIRBs were addressed in 32/102 comments (31%). Also addressed were institutional review board (IRB) responsibilities (39/102; 38%), cost (27/102; 26%), the role of local IRBs (14/102; 14%), and allowable policy exceptions (19/102; 19%). The NIH further clarified or provided guidance for selection criteria, IRB responsibilities, and cost in the final policy (June 2016). Local IRB reviews and exemptions guidance were unchanged.CONCLUSIONS: In this case study, public comments were effective in shaping policy as the NIH modified provisions or planned supplemental guidance in response to comments. Yet critical knowledge gaps remain, and empirical data are necessary. The NIH is considering mechanisms to support the establishment of best practices for sIRB implementation.","['Ethics Committees, Research', 'Humans', 'Multicenter Studies as Topic', 'National Institutes of Health (U.S.)', 'Policy', 'Policy Making', 'Public Opinion', 'United States']",29517531,"[['K01.752.566.479.147.750', 'N04.452.758.788.300.750', 'N05.350.268.750', 'N05.700.685.300.750'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E05.318.372.658', 'N05.715.360.330.643', 'N06.850.520.450.643'], ['I01.409.418.750.600.650.496', 'N03.540.052.750', 'N03.540.348.500.500.600.650.496'], ['I01.655', 'N03.623'], ['N03.706.742'], ['I01.880.630.548'], ['Z01.107.567.875']]","['Humanities [K]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Geographicals [Z]']",0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1
"The hemodynamic effects of AT-112, an analog of ketanserin, in portal hypertensive rats.","A serotonin mechanism has been reported to contribute to the hyperdynamic circulation of portal hypertension. Different studies have demonstrated that serotonin antagonists decrease portal pressure in portal hypertensive patients and animals. The present study was undertaken to investigate the effect of AT-112, an analog of ketanserin, on portal hypertension induced by partial portal vein ligation in rats. Since ketanserin is known to possess alpha 1-adrenergic antagonistic activity, the effect of AT-112 was compared to that of prazosin. A single dose (prazosin 4.2 micrograms/kg, AT-112 1 mg/kg) was chosen to produce a similar hypotensive effect (-20 +/- 4% for prazosin and -24 +/- 4% for AT-112). At this dose, prazosin significantly decreased total peripheral resistance whereas AT-112 significantly decreased cardiac index and heart rate. Both agents significantly decreased the portal tributary blood flow and portal pressure. In rats receiving AT-112, a significant correlation was found between the magnitudes of decrease in cardiac index and the decrease in portal tributary blood flow. We also found that the magnitude of reduction in portal pressure was greater following AT-112 administration. This study suggested that AT-112 may have more beneficial hemodynamic effects than prazosin in portal hypertensive rats. Our results provide further support for the serotonergic mechanism in the pathogenesis of hyperdynamic circulation in portal hypertension.","['Animals', 'Antihypertensive Agents', 'Blood Pressure', 'Hemodynamics', 'Hypertension, Portal', 'Male', 'Prazosin', 'Quinazolines', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Splanchnic Circulation']",9065957,"[['B01.050'], ['D27.505.954.411.162'], ['E01.370.600.875.249', 'G09.330.380.076'], ['G09.330.380'], ['C06.552.494'], ['D03.633.100.786.750'], ['D03.633.100.786'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700.750'], ['G09.330.100.881']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Diseases [C]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Clinical evaluation of fiber-reinforced composite inlay FPDs.,"PURPOSE: This clinical study evaluated the behavior of inlay fixed partial dentures (IFPD) with conventional and modified framework designs over a period of 12 to 48 months.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-one glass fiber-reinforced composite IFPDs were made to replace one missing maxillary or mandibular tooth. The frameworks were made only with parallel fibers in 19 restorations (group 1) and built with parallel and woven fibers modifying the design of the pontic element in 22 IFPDs (group 2) according to the manufacturer's instructions. All restorations were evaluated by color match, marginal discoloration, secondary caries, surface texture, marginal adaptation, fracture, and postoperative sensitivity.RESULTS: Three partial adhesive-cohesive veneering composite fractures occurred in the pontic element in group 1 after 3, 4, and 8 months, respectively. One cohesive fracture occurred in an abutment in group 2 after 46 months. Group 1 showed a 16% fracture failure rate; group 2 showed a 5% failure rate. However, no statistical difference was detected between the groups. IFPDs received the highest score at the following rates: color match 71%, marginal discoloration 96%, secondary caries 99%, surface texture 88%, marginal adaptation 98%, fracture 90%, and postoperative sensitivity 100%. Statistical analysis indicated significant deterioration of color match from baseline to last recall.CONCLUSION: There were nonsignificantly fewer fractures of the veneering composite with the modified design of the framework than with the conventional design. Repair of the fractured veneer of IFPDs may lengthen the lifespan of the restorations, but it is advisable only for slight damage.","['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Cementation', 'Chi-Square Distribution', 'Composite Resins', 'Dental Restoration Failure', 'Denture Design', 'Denture Repair', 'Denture, Partial, Fixed', 'Female', 'Glass', 'Glass Ionomer Cements', 'Humans', 'Inlays', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Odds Ratio', 'Resin Cements', 'Silicate Cement', 'Statistics, Nonparametric', 'Survival Analysis']",12854799,"[['M01.060.057'], ['M01.060.116'], ['E05.170', 'E06.095.170'], ['E05.318.740.994.300', 'G17.820.300', 'N05.715.360.750.750.200', 'N06.850.520.830.994.300'], ['D05.750.716.822.308', 'D25.339.816.500', 'D25.720.716.822.308', 'J01.637.051.339.816.500', 'J01.637.051.720.716.822.308'], ['E06.323.400', 'E06.780.346.725'], ['E06.780.346.760.300', 'E06.912.250'], ['E06.780.346.760.500', 'E06.912.285'], ['E06.780.346.760.943.271', 'E07.695.190.200.220.220'], ['J01.637.437'], ['D25.339.291.402', 'J01.637.051.339.291.402'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E06.323.428.275', 'E06.780.346.737.500', 'E07.695.190.190.350'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['E05.318.740.600.600', 'G17.680.500', 'N05.715.360.750.625.590', 'N06.850.520.830.600.600'], ['D05.750.716.822.730', 'D25.339.291.750', 'D25.720.716.822.730', 'J01.637.051.339.291.750', 'J01.637.051.720.716.822.730'], ['D25.339.291.800', 'J01.637.051.339.291.800'], ['E05.318.740.995', 'N05.715.360.750.760', 'N06.850.520.830.995'], ['E05.318.740.998', 'N05.715.360.750.795', 'N06.850.520.830.998']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]', 'Organisms [B]']",0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0

Downregulation of miR-224-5p Promotes Migration and Proliferation in Human Dental Pulp Stem Cells.,"Introduction: Pulp regeneration, as a treatment for pulp necrosis, has significant advantages over root canal therapy for the preservation of living pulp. To date, research on pulp regeneration has mainly focused on the transplantation of pulp stem cells into the root canal, but there is still a lack of research on the migration of pulp cells into the root canal via cell homing. Stem cells from the apical tooth papilla (SCAP) are recognized as multidirectional stem cells, but these cells are difficult to obtain. MicroRNAs are small noncoding RNAs that play crucial roles in regulating normal and pathologic functions. We hypothesized that some types of microRNAs might improve the migration and proliferation function of dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs), which are easily obtained in clinical practice, and as a result, DPSCs might replace SCAP and provide valuable information for regenerative endodontics.Methods: Magnetic activated cell sorting of DPSCs and SCAP was performed. Next-generation sequencing was performed to examine DPSCs and SCAP miRNAs expression and to identify the most significant differentially expressed miRNA. CCK-8 and transwell assays were used to determine the impact of this miRNA on DPSCs proliferation and migration.Results: The most significant differentially expressed miRNA between DPSCs and SCAP was miR-224-5p. Downregulating miR-224-5p promoted DPSCs proliferation and migration; the opposite results were observed when miR-224-5p was upregulated.Conclusion: MiR-224-5p promotes proliferation and migration in DPSCs, a finding that is of great significance for further exploring the role of dental pulp stem cells in regenerative endodontics.","['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Cell Movement', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Dental Pulp', 'Down-Regulation', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'MicroRNAs', 'Stem Cells']",31396530,"[['M01.060.057'], ['M01.060.116'], ['G04.198', 'G07.568.500.180'], ['G04.161.750', 'G07.345.249.410.750'], ['A14.549.167.900.260'], ['G02.111.240', 'G05.308.200', 'G07.690.773.937'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D13.150.650.319', 'D13.444.735.150.319', 'D13.444.735.790.552.500'], ['A11.872']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]']",1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
Osteomalacia in fractures of the proximal femur.,"The occurrence of osteomalacia was studied in 58 hip fracture patients who were admitted to the University Central Hospital of Kuopio for operative treatment. Findings indicating osteomalacia were frequent in the series. Hypocalcaemia was found in 70 per cent and an increase in serum alkaline phosphatase in 22 per cent of the patients. Urinary calcium excretion was decreased in 45 per cent and urinary hydroxyproline excretion was increased in 70 per cent of the cases. The serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D and 24,25-dihydroxyvitamin D were significantly decreased in the patients compared with the controls. Histomorphometric analysis revealed no difference in the amount of trabecular bone in the patients compared with the controls, but the amount of osteoid and resorption surfaces was increased in the patients. Histological osteomalacia was found in 12 out of 50 patients (24 per cent). In 10 of these 12 cases the diagnosis of osteomalacia was supported by biochemical changes. There was only one patient, a 29-year-old man with glutein enteropathy who had an evident reason for osteomalacia. The most obvious cause of osteomalacia was the lack of vitamin D due to a deficient diet and lack of exposure to sunlight. The conclusion drawn was that osteoporosis was the main cause and osteomalacia was an important aggravating factor in the bone fragility in these hip fracture patients.","['Aged', 'Alkaline Phosphatase', 'Anthropometry', 'Calcium', 'Female', 'Femoral Neck Fractures', 'Hip Fractures', 'Humans', 'Hydroxycholecalciferols', 'Hypocalcemia', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Osteomalacia', 'Osteoporosis', 'Sex Factors']",7136573,"[['M01.060.116.100'], ['D08.811.277.352.650.035'], ['E01.370.600.024', 'E05.041', 'N06.850.505.200.100'], ['D01.268.552.100', 'D01.552.539.288', 'D23.119.100'], ['C26.404.061.425.500', 'C26.531.750.500', 'C26.558.276.425.500'], ['C26.404.061.425', 'C26.531.750', 'C26.558.276.425'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D04.210.500.247.222.159.478', 'D04.210.500.247.808.146.478', 'D04.210.500.812.768.196.478', 'D10.570.938.146.478'], ['C18.452.174.509', 'C18.452.950.509'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['C05.116.198.816.640', 'C18.452.104.816.640', 'C18.452.174.845.640', 'C18.654.521.500.133.770.734.640'], ['C05.116.198.579', 'C18.452.104.579'], ['N05.715.350.675', 'N06.850.490.875']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
Binaural speech intelligibility in noise for hearing-impaired listeners.,"The effect of head-induced interaural time delay (ITD) and interaural level differences (ILD) on binaural speech intelligibility in noise was studied for listeners with symmetrical and asymmetrical sensorineural hearing losses. The material, recorded with a KEMAR manikin in an anechoic room, consisted of speech, presented from the front (0 degree), and noise, presented at azimuths of 0 degree, 30 degrees, and 90 degrees. Derived noise signals, containing either only ITD or only ILD, were generated using a computer. For both groups of subjects, speech-reception thresholds (SRT) for sentences in noise were determined as a function of: (1) noise azimuth, (2) binaural cue, and (3) an interaural difference in overall presentation level, simulating the effect of a monaural hearing acid. Comparison of the mean results with corresponding data obtained previously from normal-hearing listeners shows that the hearing impaired have a 2.5 dB higher SRT in noise when both speech and noise are presented from the front, and 2.6-5.1 dB less binaural gain when the noise azimuth is changed from 0 degree to 90 degrees. The gain due to ILD varies among the hearing-impaired listeners between 0 dB and normal values of 7 dB or more. It depends on the high-frequency hearing loss at the side presented with the most favorable signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio. The gain due to ITD is nearly normal for the symmetrically impaired (4.2 dB, compared with 4.7 dB for the normal hearing), but only 2.5 dB in the case of asymmetrical impairment. When ITD is introduced in noise already containing ILD, the resulting gain is 2-2.5 dB for all groups. The only marked effect of the interaural difference in overall presentation level is a reduction of the gain due to ILD when the level at the ear with the better S/N ratio is decreased. This implies that an optimal monaural hearing aid (with a moderate gain) will hardly interfere with unmasking through ITD, while it may increase the gain due to ILD by preventing or diminishing threshold effects.","['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Female', 'Functional Laterality', 'Hearing Loss, Sensorineural', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Noise', 'Speech Perception']",2808911,"[['M01.060.057'], ['M01.060.116'], ['F02.830.297.425', 'G11.561.225.425'], ['C09.218.458.341.887', 'C10.597.751.418.341.887', 'C23.888.592.763.393.341.887'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['G01.750.770.776.567', 'G16.500.275.600', 'N06.230.400', 'N06.850.460.610'], ['F02.463.593.071.875', 'G07.888.125.875']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Health Care [N]']",0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
Emergency repair of giant inguinoscrotal hernia in a septic patient.,"INTRODUCTION: Giant inguinoscrotal hernias are rare but still exist even in developed countries. Although accompanied by a higher perioperative mortality, an elective surgical approach should be undertaken. In critically ill patients, however, the surgical intervention requires specific demands.METHODS: We report a case of a 45-year-old man who was referred to the hospital after perforation of the hernia with concomitant peritonitis and sepsis.RESULTS: After initial stabilization of the patient, a subtotal colectomy and a partial small bowl resection was performed. In a second step after stabilization of organ functions, the hernia sac was resected, and the abdominal cavity was reconstructed. The patient was discharged and is doing well until today but still refuses any plastic surgery.CONCLUSION: Resection of giant inguinoscrotal hernia is feasible even in patients being administered in an emergency setting. Especially in case of an intra-abdominal infection, intestinal resection is the therapy of choice to allow the reconstruction of the abdominal cavity. A two-step approach should be considered to allow a successful recovery.","['Emergency Treatment', 'Hernia, Inguinal', 'Herniorrhaphy', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Scrotum', 'Sepsis']",23299222,"[['E02.365'], ['C23.300.707.374.875'], ['E04.680.325'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['A05.360.444.661'], ['C01.757', 'C23.550.470.790.500']]","['Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
Comparison of titanium and absorbable polymeric surgical clips for use in laparoscopic cholecystectomy.,"The use of hemostatic surgical clips is crucial in laparoscopic surgery. Metal clips can cause significant interference with computerized tomography, may have poor holding power, and may erode into important anatomic structures. Polymeric absorbable clips, which have advantages over metallic clips, are evaluated in this study. In vitro and in vivo studies were undertaken to evaluate the hold force, rate of degradation, tissue reactivity and safety of absorbable polymeric clips. Absorbable and titanium clips were applied across excised canine cystic ducts and both axial and transverse pull-off forces were measured. In the second phase, absorbable clips were implanted subcutaneously into male rats and the strength remaining within the clips was measured after 7, 10, 14, or 21 days. In phase 3, 30 pigs were randomized into six groups and each animal underwent a laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The cystic duct and artery were ligated with absorbable polymeric clips (experimental group) or titanium clips (control group). Animals were sacrificed at 7, 14, or 28 days and a celiotomy was performed. Intraabdominal adhesions were assessed and scored. The force required to dislodge the absorbable clip was significantly greater than for metallic clips for both axial and transverse forces. Absorbable clip strength retention decreased over time as expected with a retention of 11% original strength by the 21st day. Adhesions were highest when bile spillage occurred, but did not differ significantly between either clip type. Absorbable polymeric clips were hemostatically effective in this laparoscopic model and may offer advantages over metallic clips.","['Animals', 'Cholecystectomy, Laparoscopic', 'Dogs', 'Hemostasis, Surgical', 'Male', 'Materials Testing', 'Polyglycolic Acid', 'Polymers', 'Rats', 'Sutures', 'Swine', 'Titanium']",7974100,"[['B01.050'], ['E04.210.120.172.140', 'E04.502.250.520.160'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.750.250.216.200'], ['E02.520.490', 'E04.350'], ['E05.570'], ['D05.750.728.780', 'D25.720.728.780', 'J01.637.051.720.728.780'], ['D05.750', 'D25.720', 'J01.637.051.720'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700'], ['E07.858.690.820'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.500.880'], ['D01.268.557.800', 'D01.268.956.878', 'D01.552.547.800']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]']",0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
Quality of Recovery After Low-Pressure Laparoscopic Donor Nephrectomy Facilitated by Deep Neuromuscular Blockade: A Randomized Controlled Study.,"BACKGROUND: The use of low intra-abdominal pressure (<10 mmHg) reduces postoperative pain scores after laparoscopic surgery.OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether low-pressure pneumoperitoneum with deep neuromuscular blockade improves the quality of recovery after laparoscopic donor nephrectomy (LDN).DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: In a single-center randomized controlled trial, 64 live kidney donors were randomly assigned to 6 or 12 mmHg insufflation pressure. A deep neuromuscular block was used in both groups. Surgical conditions were rated by the five-point Leiden-surgical rating scale (L-SRS), ranging from 5 (optimal) to 1 (extremely poor) conditions. If the L-SRS was insufficient, the pressure was increased stepwise.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The primary outcome measure was the overall score on the quality of recovery-40 (QOR-40) questionnaire at postoperative day 1.RESULTS: The difference in the QOR-40 scores on day 1 between the low- and standard-pressure group was not significant (p = .06). Also the overall pain scores and analgesic consumption did not differ. Eight procedures (24%), initially started with low pressure, were converted to a standard pressure (?10 mmHg). A L-SRS score of 5 was significantly more prevalent in the standard pressure as compared to the low-pressure group at 30 min after insufflation (p < .01).CONCLUSIONS: Low-pressure pneumoperitoneum facilitated by deep neuromuscular blockade during LDN does not reduce postoperative pain scores nor improve the quality of recovery in the early postoperative phase. The question whether the use of deep neuromuscular blockade during laparoscopic surgery reduces postoperative pain scores independent of the intra-abdominal pressure should be pursued in future studies.TRIAL REGISTRATION: The trial was registered at clinicaltrial.gov before the start of the trial (NCT02146417).","['Double-Blind Method', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Laparoscopy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nephrectomy', 'Neuromuscular Blockade', 'Pain, Postoperative', 'Pneumoperitoneum, Artificial', 'Pressure', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Tissue and Organ Harvesting']",28608013,"[['E05.318.370.300', 'E05.581.500.300', 'N05.715.360.325.320', 'N06.850.520.445.300'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E01.370.388.250.520', 'E04.502.250.520'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['E04.950.774.435'], ['E03.706', 'E05.635'], ['C23.550.767.700', 'C23.888.592.612.832'], ['E01.370.388.605'], ['G01.374.715'], ['E05.318.308.980', 'N05.715.360.300.800', 'N06.850.520.308.980'], ['E04.936.537']]","['Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
Modeling amplified p53 responses under DNA-PK inhibition in DNA damage response.,"During DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) repair, coordinated activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-like kinases can activate p53 signaling pathway. Recent findings have identified novel interplays among these kinases demonstrating amplified first p53 pulses under DNA-PK inhibition. However, no theoretical model has been developed to characterize such dynamics. In current work, we modeled the prolonged p53 pulses with DNA-PK inhibitor. We could identify a dose-dependent increase in the first pulse amplitude and width. Meanwhile, weakened DNA-PK mediated ATM inhibition was insufficient to reproduce such dynamic behavior. Moreover, the information flow was shifted predominantly to the first pulse under DNA-PK inhibition. Furthermore, the amplified p53 responses were relatively robust. Taken together, our model can faithfully replicate amplified p53 responses under DNA-PK inhibition and provide insights into cell fate decision by manipulating p53 dynamics.","['Algorithms', 'Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA Repair', 'DNA-Activated Protein Kinase', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Gene Amplification', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Nuclear Proteins', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases', 'Phosphorylation', 'Radiation, Ionizing', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stochastic Processes', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53']",28177883,"[['G17.035', 'L01.224.050'], ['D08.811.913.696.620.682.700.097', 'D12.776.157.687.125', 'D12.776.660.720.125'], ['G05.200'], ['G02.111.222', 'G05.219'], ['D08.811.913.696.620.682.700.250', 'D12.776.157.687.438', 'D12.776.660.720.438'], ['E05.799.513.500', 'G01.750.740.500', 'G04.712.500', 'G07.225', 'G07.738.500', 'N06.850.810.250.180'], ['G02.111.263', 'G03.328'], ['G05.308.250', 'G05.365.590.310', 'G05.558.315'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['G01.374.661', 'G02.111.490'], ['D12.776.660'], ['D08.811.913.696.620.500'], ['G02.111.665', 'G02.607.780', 'G03.796'], ['G01.750.750'], ['G02.111.820', 'G04.835'], ['E05.318.740.996', 'G17.830', 'N05.715.360.750.770', 'N06.850.520.830.996'], ['D12.776.157.687.650', 'D12.776.260.820', 'D12.776.624.776.775', 'D12.776.660.720.650', 'D12.776.744.845']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]']",0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0
Initial Experiences of Laparoscopic Gastric Greater Curvature Plication in Korea-A Review of 64 Cases.,"PURPOSE: Laparoscopic gastric greater curvature plication (LGGCP) is an emerging, alternative form of restrictive weight loss surgery. We present our experiences of LGGCP with the primary focus on surgical techniques and weight loss. In addition, an investigation was performed on the food tolerance of LGGCP patients.MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was conducted by retrospectively reviewing the prospectively collected data of patients who underwent LGGCP from March 2013 to February 2015.RESULTS: Of the 64 patients were eligible for the study, 59 (92.2%) were female. Mean (range) patient age was 34 (21-49) years. Mean ± standard deviation (SD) preoperative body mass index was 31.4 ± 4.3 kg/m(2). There were no mortalities or postoperative complications. Immediate postoperative nausea and vomiting occurred in 58 patients (90.6%), mean postoperative hospital stay duration was 2.3 days (range, 1-7 days), and mean percentage excess body mass index losses at 1, 3, 6, 12, and 18 months were 34.7% (n = 64), 50.8% (n = 60), 61.1% (n = 40), 82.1% (n = 19), and 82.9% (n = 12), respectively. Follow-up endoscopy was performed at 12 months postoperatively in 19 patients, and reflux esophagitis of grade LA-M was observed in 16 patients (84.2%), LA-A in 2 patients (10.5%), and LA-B in 1 patient (5.3%). Mean ± SD satisfaction score with current eating and total food tolerance score was 4.27 ± 0.55 and 20.95 ± 4.30, respectively.CONCLUSIONS: LGGCP is an intervention that may be comparable with sleeve gastrectomy or adjustable gastric banding, especially for Class I or II obesity in an Asian population. Furthermore, quality of eating, as determined using food tolerance scores, was excellent.","['Adult', 'Bariatric Surgery', 'Body Mass Index', 'Eating', 'Esophagitis, Peptic', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Laparoscopy', 'Length of Stay', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nausea', 'Obesity', 'Patient Satisfaction', 'Republic of Korea', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Stomach', 'Vomiting', 'Weight Loss', 'Young Adult']",26389582,"[['M01.060.116'], ['E02.650.500.062', 'E04.062'], ['E01.370.600.115.100.125', 'E05.041.124.125', 'G07.100.100.125', 'N06.850.505.200.100.175'], ['G07.203.650.283', 'G10.261.330'], ['C06.405.117.620.420', 'C06.405.205.663.420', 'C06.405.469.275.800.523', 'C06.405.748.586.524'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E01.370.388.250.520', 'E04.502.250.520'], ['E02.760.400.480', 'N02.421.585.400.480'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['C23.888.821.712'], ['C18.654.726.500', 'C23.888.144.699.500', 'E01.370.600.115.100.160.120.699.500', 'G07.100.100.160.120.699.500'], ['F01.100.150.750.625', 'F01.145.488.887.625', 'N04.452.822.700', 'N05.300.150.800.625', 'N05.715.360.600'], ['Z01.252.474.557.750'], ['E05.318.372.500.500.500', 'E05.318.372.500.750.750', 'N05.715.360.330.500.500.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.825', 'N06.850.520.450.500.500.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.825'], ['A03.556.875.875'], ['C23.888.821.937'], ['C23.888.144.243.963', 'G07.345.249.314.120.200.963'], ['M01.060.116.815']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1

Nkx2.5 enhances the efficacy of mesenchymal stem cells transplantation in treatment heart failure in rats.,"AIMS: The aim of this study is to determine whether Nkx2.5 transfection of transplanted bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) improves the efficacy of treatment of adriamycin-induced heart failure in a rat model.MAIN METHODS: Nkx2.5 was transfected in MSCs by lentiviral vector transduction. The expressions of Nkx2.5 and cardiac specific genes in MSCs and Nkx2.5 transfected mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs-Nkx2.5) were analyzed with quantitative real-time PCR and Western blot in vitro. Heart failure models of rats were induced by adriamycin and were then randomly divided into 3 groups: injected saline, MSCs or MSCs-Nkx2.5 via the femoral vein respectively. Four weeks after injection, the cardiac function, expressions of cardiac specific gene, fibrosis formation and collagen volume fraction in the myocardium as well as the expressions of GATA4 and MEF2 in rats were analyzed with echocardiography, immunohistochemistry, Masson staining, quantitative real-time PCR and Western blot, respectively.KEY FINDINGS: Nkx2.5 enhanced cardiac specific gene expressions including á-MHC, TNI, CKMB, connexin-43 in MSCs-Nkx2.5 in vitro. Both MSCs and MSCs-Nkx2.5 improved cardiac function, promoted the differentiation of transplanted MSCs into cardiomyocyte-like cells, decreased fibrosis formation and collagen volume fraction in the myocardium, as well as increased the expressions of GATA4 and MEF2 in adriamycin-induced rat heart failure models. Moreover, the effect was much more remarkable in MSCs-Nkx2.5 than in MSCs group.SIGNIFICANCE: This study has found that Nkx2.5 enhances the efficacy of MSCs transplantation in treatment adriamycin-induced heart failure in rats. Nkx2.5 transfected to transplanted MSCs provides a potential effective approach to heart failure.","['Animals', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Doxorubicin', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Heart Failure', 'Homeobox Protein Nkx-2.5', 'Male', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells', 'Myocytes, Cardiac', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transfection']",28624390,"[['B01.050'], ['E05.196.401.143', 'E05.301.300.096', 'E05.478.566.320.200', 'E05.601.262', 'E05.601.470.320.200'], ['G04.152'], ['C22.232', 'E05.598.500', 'E05.599.395.080'], ['D02.455.426.559.847.562.050.200.175', 'D04.615.562.050.200.175', 'D09.408.051.059.200.175'], ['G05.308'], ['C14.280.434'], ['D12.776.260.400.234', 'D12.776.930.324'], ['E02.095.147.500.500.625', 'E04.936.225.687.625'], ['A11.329.830.500', 'A11.872.590.500'], ['A07.541.704.570', 'A10.690.552.750.570', 'A11.620.500'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700.750'], ['E05.393.620.500.706'], ['E05.393.350.810', 'G05.728.860']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Novel sulfated octa- and decasaccharides from squid cartilage chondroitin sulfate E: sequencing and application for determination of the epitope structure of the monoclonal antibody MO-225.,"A mixture of octa- and decasaccharides obtained by the digestion with the hyaluronidase of chondroitin sulfate E derived from squid cartilage was subfractionated into 20 and 23 different components, respectively, by anion-exchange HPLC. MALDI-TOF/MS was used to assign the sugar and sulfate composition of the putative octa- and decasaccharides, and a disaccharide composition analysis revealed the building blocks to be A- [GlcUAbeta1-3GalNAc(4S)], C- [GlcUAbeta1-3GalNAc(6S)], and E- [GlcUAbeta1-3GalNAc(4S,6S)] units, where 4S and 6S represent 4-O- and 6-O-sulfate, respectively. The sequences of these octa- and decasaccharides were determined at low picomole amounts by a combination of enzymatic digestions with chondroitinases in conjunction with anion-exchange HPLC. Sequencing revealed that each fraction is a mixture of a major component together with one to three minor components, reflecting the heterogeneity of the parent polysaccharide. Among the 11 different octasaccharide sequences reported here, 8 are novel, while all of the 6 decasaccharide sequences are novel, and this is the first report of the sequencing of CS oligosaccharides longer than octasaccharides. The reactivity of the monoclonal antibody MO-225 with octa- and decasaccharides tested with an oligosaccharide microarray revealed that a CS-E decasaccharide is the minimal requirement for antibody recognition. Among the 6 decasaccharides, only E-E-E-E-C was recognized by MO-225, suggesting the requirement of a C-unit at the reducing end and also the importance of chain length, which in turn may indicate the importance of the conformation acquired by this specific sequence for antibody recognition.","['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Cartilage', 'Chondroitin Sulfates', 'Chromatography, Gel', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Chromatography, Ion Exchange', 'Epitopes', 'Sharks', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization']",17284053,"[['B01.050'], ['D12.776.124.486.485.114.224', 'D12.776.124.790.651.114.224', 'D12.776.377.715.548.114.224'], ['A02.165', 'A10.165.382'], ['D09.698.373.200.300'], ['E05.196.181.400.250'], ['E05.196.181.400.300'], ['E05.196.181.400.383'], ['D23.050.550'], ['B01.050.150.900.493.370.853'], ['E05.196.566.755']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
A high-resolution melting approach for analyzing allelic expression dynamics.,"Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are single base pair mutations that provide new approaches to studies of allele transcript abundances. High-resolution DNA melting curve (HRM) analysis using a LightScanner (Hi-Res Melting system with Idaho's LC Green) provides post-PCR detection of mutations and SNPs in genomic DNA. This study investigated whether the HRM analysis can distinguish alleles among potato (Solanum tuberosum) transcript abundances. Transcript properties of genes encoding seven carbohydrate metabolism enzymes/proteins in various tissues and cold storage durations were studied. The HRM assay measured differential expression of alleles between different organs, between different storage treatments and stages of tubers from the same variety, and between different varieties with the same treatment. The RT-PCR amplicons were directly sequenced to assist the interpretation of HRM data. The cDNA HRM curves correlated well with the nucleotide polymorphisms of the cDNA sequences and the transcript abundance of alleles and therefore can serve as functional allele activity (FAA) markers. By combining the allelic specificity of HRM with simple PCR design, this technology can be applied to rapidly determine the most active allele of a gene among the cells analyzed.","['Alleles', 'Base Sequence', 'Genes, Plant', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nucleic Acid Denaturation', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Solanum tuberosum']",19193959,"[['G05.360.340.024.340.030'], ['G02.111.570.080', 'G05.360.080', 'L01.453.245.667.080'], ['G05.360.340.024.340.393', 'G05.360.340.365.500'], ['L01.453.245.667'], ['E05.393.640', 'G02.111.603', 'G05.627'], ['G05.365.795.598'], ['E05.393.620.500.725'], ['B01.650.940.800.575.912.250.908.500.725.777']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]']",0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
Impact of anxiety and depressive symptoms on perceptions of stigma in persons living with HIV disease in rural versus urban North Carolina.,"This analysis examined the relationships between HIV-related stigma, depression, and anxiety in rural and urban sites. Participants were HIV-positive urban (n = 100) and rural (n = 100) adult residents of a US southern state, drawn from a sample for a larger international study of self-esteem and self-compassion. Measures included demographic and health information, the HIV Stigma Scale, the Center for Epidemiology Studies Depression Scale (CES-D), and the Symptom Checklist 90 Revised (SCL-R-90) anxiety scale. Independent sample t-tests showed no significant differences between urban/rural groups on measures of HIV-related stigma, anxiety, or depression, except that rural participants reported greater disclosure concerns (t = 2.11, df = 196, p = .036). Both groups indicated high levels of depression and anxiety relative to published norms and clinically relevant cut-off scores. Hierarchical regression analyses were conducted for the HIV Stigma Scale including its four subscales and total stigma scores. Block 1 (control) contained health and demographic variables known to predict HIV-related stigma. Block 2 included the CES-D and the SCL-R-90, and Block 3 was urban/rural location. Mental health symptom scores contributed a significant amount to explained variance in total stigma scores (5.5%, FÄ = 6.020, p < .01), personalized stigma (4.8%, FÄ = 5.035, p < .01), negative self-image (9.7%, FÄ = 12.289, p < .001), and concern with public attitudes (4.9%, FÄ = 5.228, p < .01), but not disclosure concerns. Urban/rural location made significant additional contributions to the variance for total stigma (1.7%, FÄ = 3.899, p < .05), disclosure concerns (2.6%, FÄ = 5.446, p < .05), and concern with public attitudes (1.9%, FÄ = 4.169, p < .05) but not personalized stigma or negative self-image. Depression scores consistently and significantly predicted perceived stigma total and subscale scores. Findings suggest that mental health symptoms and urban/rural location play important roles in perceived stigma, and treatment implications are presented.","['Adult', 'Anxiety', 'Depression', 'Empathy', 'Female', 'HIV Infections', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'North Carolina', 'Perception', 'Regression Analysis', 'Rural Population', 'Self Concept', 'Social Stigma', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Urban Population']",26643581,"[['M01.060.116'], ['F01.470.132'], ['F01.145.126.350'], ['F01.752.355', 'F01.752.543.500.500'], ['C01.221.250.875', 'C01.221.812.640.400', 'C01.778.640.400', 'C01.925.782.815.616.400', 'C01.925.813.400', 'C20.673.480'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['Z01.107.567.875.075.475', 'Z01.107.567.875.750.530'], ['F02.463.593'], ['E05.318.740.750', 'N05.715.360.750.695', 'N06.850.520.830.750'], ['N01.600.725'], ['F01.752.747.792'], ['F01.145.813.840'], ['I01.880.853.996', 'N01.824'], ['N01.600.900']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]']",0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1
Extraction of polysaccharides from Phellinus nigricans mycelia and their antioxidant activities in vitro.,"In this study, response surface methodology was employed to optimize the extraction of polysaccharides from Phellinus nigricans mycelia. A central composite design was adopted to determine optimum parameters (extraction time, extraction temperature, extraction frequency, and ratio of water to raw material) that could yield a maximum polysaccharide. Results revealed the following optimum extraction conditions: extraction time, 2.8h; ratio of water to raw material, 28; extraction frequency, 5; and extraction temperature, 95 °C. Under optimized conditions, the experimental yield of P. nigricans mycelia polysaccharides was 15.33 ± 0.21%, which is consistent with the predicted yield. The antioxidant activity assay in vitro showed that the polysaccharides exhibited a high scavenging activity against superoxide anion, hydroxyl, and 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl radicals. These polysaccharides also exhibited a strong reducing power. Thus, these polysaccharides can be used as natural antioxidants in functional foods or medicine.","['Basidiomycota', 'Biphenyl Compounds', 'Factor Analysis, Statistical', 'Free Radical Scavengers', 'Fungal Polysaccharides', 'Hydroxyl Radical', 'Mycelium', 'Picrates', 'Superoxides', 'Temperature', 'Water']",24274486,"[['B01.300.179'], ['D02.455.426.559.389.185'], ['E05.318.740.400', 'N05.715.360.750.350', 'N06.850.520.830.400'], ['D27.505.519.217.500'], ['D09.698.357', 'D23.050.202.283'], ['D01.045.250.357', 'D01.248.497.158.459.300', 'D01.339.431.249'], ['A19.687'], ['D02.455.426.559.389.657.566.690', 'D02.640.743.690'], ['D01.248.497.158.685.750.850', 'D01.339.431.374.850', 'D01.650.550.750.800', 'D02.389.338.732'], ['G01.906.595', 'G16.500.275.063.725.710', 'G16.500.750.775.710', 'N06.230.150.450', 'N06.230.300.100.725.710'], ['D01.045.250.875', 'D01.248.497.158.459.650', 'D01.650.550.925']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
Wilson disease protein ATP7B is localized in the late endosomes in a polarized human hepatocyte cell line.,"Wilson disease is a genetic disorder characterized by the accumulation of copper in the body due to a defect of biliary copper excretion. The gene responsible for Wilson disease has been cloned, however, the precise localization of this gene product ATP7B, a copper-transporting ATPase, is still controversial. We examined the localization of ATP7B by expressing a chimeric protein, ATP7B-tagged with green fluorescent protein (GFP) (GFP-ATP7B), in HEK293, Hep3B and a highly polarized human hepatocyte line (OUMS29). Intracellular organelles were visualized by immunofluorescence microscopy. The effects of bathocuproine disulfonate, a copper chelator, and copper sulfate were examined. GFP-ATP7B colocalized with a late endosome marker, but not with endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi, or lysosome markers in a copper-depleting condition. Treatment with copper sulfate did not affect the localization of ATP7B. ATP7B is localized in the late endosomes in both copper-depleting and copper-loaded conditions. ATP7B seems to translocate copper from the cytosol into the late endosomes, and copper may be excreted to bile via lysosomes. We believe that the disturbed incorporation of copper into the late endosomes caused by mutated ATP7B is the main defect in Wilson disease.","['Adenosine Triphosphatases', 'Cation Transport Proteins', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Polarity', 'Chelating Agents', 'Copper', 'Copper Sulfate', 'Copper-Transporting ATPases', 'Endosomes', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins', 'Hepatocytes', 'Humans', 'Luminescent Proteins', 'Mutation', 'Phenanthrolines', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Transfection']",12579329,"[['D08.811.277.040.025'], ['D12.776.157.530.450.250', 'D12.776.543.585.450.250'], ['A11.251.210'], ['G04.250'], ['D27.505.519.914.500', 'D27.720.832.500'], ['D01.268.556.195', 'D01.268.956.170', 'D01.552.544.195'], ['D01.875.800.800.850.150'], ['D08.811.277.040.025.314.500', 'D12.776.157.530.450.250.578.750', 'D12.776.157.530.813.500', 'D12.776.543.585.450.250.578.750', 'D12.776.543.585.813.500'], ['A11.284.430.214.190.875.190.880.337'], ['D12.776.532.265'], ['A11.436.348'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D12.776.532'], ['G05.365.590'], ['D03.633.300.669'], ['D12.776.828'], ['E05.393.350.810', 'G05.728.860']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Dose frequency of prostaglandin F2á,"We hypothesized (1) that neither duration of the Ovsynch program nor dose frequency of PGF2á would change the proportion of cows with complete luteolysis (progesterone <0.4 ng/mL 72 h after PGF2á) and (2) that the additional GnRH treatment administered as part of a presynchronization program would not alter the proportion of anovulatory cows starting the timed artificial insemination (AI) program compared with an alternative shorter presynch program including only 1 GnRH treatment. Lactating Holstein cows (n = 406) were milked 3 times daily and enrolled in a 2 ? 2 ? 2 factorial experiment consisting of 8 treatments before the first postpartum AI. Treatments were used to test ovulatory, luteal, and luteolytic outcomes to 3 main effects: (1) 2 GnRH-PGF2á presynchronization programs (PG-3-G vs. Double Ovsynch), (2) 2 Ovsynch program durations [5 d: GnRH (GnRH-1)-5 d-PGF2á-24 h-PGF2á-32 h-GnRH (GnRH-2)-16 h-timed AI; 7 d: GnRH-1-7 d-PGF2á-56 h-GnRH-2-16 h-timed AI], and (3) 2 PGF2á dose frequency treatments (2 ? 25 mg) 24 h apart versus 1 dose (1 ? 50 mg) of PGF2á administered 72 h before timed AI. The presynchronization treatments of PG-3-G and Double Ovsynch had no effect on the proportion of cows with luteal function at the onset of the Ovsynch treatments (87.9 vs. 86.2%). Although ovulatory responses were similar after GnRH-1 (>60%), Double Ovsynch cows tended to have greater ovulatory responses than PG-3-G after GnRH-2 (95.3 vs. 90.6%). The 2 ? 25-mg doses of PGF2á and the 1 ? 50-mg dose induced luteolysis in both Ovsynch treatment durations, but the 1 ? 50-mg dose was less effective in the 5-d program. More pregnancy per AI (P/AI; 49.2%) tended to occur in the PG-3-G cows in the 7-d program compared with the other treatment combinations (range: 32.4-37.4%; Ovsynch ? presynch interaction). In addition, an Ovsynch ? PGF2á dose frequency interaction resulted in cows receiving the 1 ? 50-mg dose in the 7-d program having the greatest P/AI (46.1%) and cows receiving the 1 ? 50-mg dose in the 5-d program having the least P/AI (30.6%). We conclude that complete luteolysis was less effective in the 5-d program when the 1 ? 50-mg dose was applied, but both PGF2á dose frequencies (1 ? 50 mg and 2 ? 25 mg 24 h apart) effectively induced complete luteolysis in the 7-d program. Treatments producing complete luteolysis tended to be related to subsequent pregnancy outcomes.","['Animals', 'Cattle', 'Dinoprost', 'Estrus Synchronization', 'Female', 'Fertility', 'Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone', 'Insemination, Artificial', 'Lactation', 'Luteolysis', 'Ovulation', 'Pregnancy', 'Progesterone']",30100501,"[['B01.050'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.500.380.271'], ['D10.251.355.255.550.400.200', 'D23.469.050.175.725.400.200'], ['E05.820.150.370', 'G08.686.195.500.500'], ['G08.686.210'], ['D06.472.699.327.740.320', 'D12.644.400.400.740.320', 'D12.644.456.460', 'D12.644.548.365.740.320', 'D12.776.631.650.405.740.320'], ['E02.875.800.937', 'E05.820.800.937', 'G08.686.784.363.492'], ['G08.686.523', 'G08.686.702.500'], ['G08.686.784.690.380'], ['G08.686.784.690'], ['G08.686.784.769'], ['D04.210.500.745.745.654.829', 'D06.472.334.734.623', 'D06.472.334.851.687.750']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Biological reactive intermediates that mediate chromium (VI) toxicity.,"1. Addition of Cr VI (dichromate) to isolated rat hepatocytes results in rapid glutathione oxidation, reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation, lipid peroxidation, decreased mitochondrial membrane potential and lysosomal membrane rupture before hepatocyte lysis occurred. 2. Cytotoxicity was prevented by ""ROS"" scavengers, antioxidants, and glutamine (ATP generator). Hepatocyte dichlorofluorescin oxidation (to determine ROS/Cr V formation) was inhibited by mannitol (a hydroxyl radical scavenger) or butylated hydroxyanisole and butylated hydroxytoluene (antioxidants). 3. The Cr VI reductive mechanism required for toxicity are not known. Cytotoxicity was also prevented by cytochrome P450 inhibitors, particularly CYP 2E1 inhibitors, but not inhibitors of DT diaphorase or glutathione reductase. This suggests that P450 reductase and/or reduced cytochrome P450 contributes to Cr VI reduction to Cr IV. 4. Glutathione depleted hepatocytes were resistant to Cr (VI) toxicity and much less dichlorofluorescin oxidation occurred. Reduction of dichromate by glutathione or cysteine in vitro was also accompanied by oxygen uptake and was inhibited by Mn II (a Cr IV reductant ). Cr VI induced cytotoxicity and ROS formation was also inhibited by Mn II which suggests that Cr IV and Cr IV.GSH mediate ""ROS"" formation in isolated hepatocytes. 5.

Transplacental migration of Toxocara canis larvae in experimentally infected mice.,"In experimentally infected, nonpregnant mice the larvae of Toxocara canis were not found in the uterus at any time. In mice infected at 1 week, but not at 2 weeks, before gestation, larvae were found in the uterus but not in either the placenta or fetus. In mice infected during pregnancy, larvae were found in the uterus and placenta from the 9th day and in the fetus from the 11th day of pregnancy, more abundantly when infected at the middle than at the earlier stages. Examination of microsections revealed larvae in both maternal sinusoidal spaces and fetal blood vessels of the placenta; though mechanical damage to the tissues and the debris of tissues were sometimes seen, larva-associated inflammation in these tissues were not observed. The results suggest that in the pregnant mouse the migration of T. canis larvae is influenced by the developmental stages of the placenta.","['Animals', 'Ascariasis', 'Female', 'Fetus', 'Liver', 'Maternal-Fetal Exchange', 'Mice', 'Placenta', 'Pregnancy', 'Time Factors', 'Toxocariasis', 'Uterus']",932920,"[['B01.050'], ['C01.610.335.508.700.100.070'], ['A16.378'], ['A03.620'], ['G08.686.784.769.455'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500'], ['A16.710'], ['G08.686.784.769'], ['G01.910.857'], ['C01.610.335.349.868', 'C01.610.335.508.700.100.868', 'C01.610.701.377.868', 'C22.674.377.868'], ['A05.360.319.679']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Influence of interimplant distance on gingival papilla formation and bone resorption: clinical-radiographic study in dogs.,"PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate in dogs the area between implants after prosthetic restoration within 5 mm distance between the contact point (CP) between crowns and the bone crest (BC).MATERIALS AND METHODS: The mandibular premolars of 6 dogs were extracted bilaterally. After 12 weeks of healing, each dog received 8 implants. On each side, 2 implants were separated by 2 mm (group 1) and 2 by 3 mm (group 2). After a healing period (3 months), the implants were restored with temporary acrylic resin prostheses and after 4 more weeks, with definitive metallic prostheses. After 8 weeks, the distance between the CP and the papilla (P) was measured. The distance between a line extending from the CP and the gingival height at the distal extension of the prosthesis (DE) was also measured. Digital radiographic images were obtained for evaluation of the CP-BC and BC-P distances and the analysis of bone resorption adjacent to the implant surfaces.RESULTS: The median CP-P distances were 1.75 mm and 1.98 mm for groups 1 and 2, respectively; the median CP-DE distances were 2.60 and 2.69, respectively. The mean CP-BC distances were 5.64 mm and 6.45 mm, for groups 1 and 2, respectively; mean BC-P distances were 3.07 mm and 3.55 mm, respectively.DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: The differences in distances of 2 and 3 mm between implants did not present significant differences in the formation of papillae or in crestal resorption. The CP-BC distances for prostheses should be different from those of natural teeth because in natural teeth, the biologic width is already present, and in the case of implant-supported prostheses, it will develop following second-stage surgery.","['Animals', 'Bone Resorption', 'Dental Implantation, Endosseous', 'Dental Implants', 'Dental Papilla', 'Dental Prosthesis, Implant-Supported', 'Dogs', 'Male', 'Radiography, Dental, Digital']",16519181,"[['B01.050'], ['C05.116.264', 'G11.427.213.150'], ['E04.545.550.280.280', 'E04.650.230.500', 'E06.645.550.280.280', 'E06.780.314.310'], ['D25.339.312', 'E06.780.346.593', 'E07.695.185', 'J01.637.051.339.312'], ['A14.549.167.900.720.250'], ['E06.780.346.706', 'E07.695.190.185'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.750.250.216.200'], ['E01.370.350.600.350.700.690', 'E01.370.350.700.700.690', 'E01.370.350.700.720.720', 'E06.342.764.716']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
"Association Between Diabetes, Obesity, and Short-Term Outcomes Among Patients Surgically Treated for Ankle Fracture.","BACKGROUND: Although obesity is widely accepted as a risk factor for surgical complications following orthopaedic surgery, the literature is unclear with regard to the effect of obesity on outcomes of ankle fracture surgery, particularly in the setting of competing risks from diabetes. We hypothesized that obesity would be independently associated with more frequent complications, longer hospital length of stay, and higher costs of care among patients with and without diabetes.METHODS: With use of data from 2001 to 2010 from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample, we identified all adult patients who underwent surgical treatment for a primary diagnosis of an isolated ankle fracture or dislocation. We then divided patients into four groups according to the presence or absence of diabetes or obesity: Group A included patients with neither diagnosis; Group B, obesity alone; Group C, diabetes alone; and Group D, both diagnoses. Multivariable regression models were constructed to determine the association between diagnostic group and in-hospital complications, hospital length of stay, and imputed costs of care, while controlling for other conditions.RESULTS: The final sample included 148,483 patients (78.4% in Group A, 5.0% in Group B, 13.6% in Group C, and 3.0% in Group D). The median age was 53.0 years, and most patients (62.2%) were female and had a closed bimalleolar or trimalleolar fracture (62.2%). In the unadjusted analysis, the frequency of in-hospital complications (2.6%, 4.2%, 5.3%, and 6.5% in Groups A, B, C, and D, respectively; p < 0.001), length of stay (3.0, 3.6, 4.4, and 4.8 days, respectively; p < 0.001), and costs of care ($9686, $10,555, $11,616, and $12,804, respectively, in 2010 U.S. dollars; p < 0.001) increased across groups. Patients with obesity alone (Group B) (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 1.4; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.3 to 1.6), diabetes alone (Group C) (OR = 1.1; 95% CI = 1.0 to 1.2), and both diagnoses (Group D) (OR = 1.4; 95% CI = 1.2 to 1.5) had more frequent in-hospital complications than those with neither diagnosis.CONCLUSIONS: We found that patients with concurrent diagnoses of diabetes and obesity had higher health-care utilization and costs than those with neither diagnosis or with obesity alone or diabetes alone. The delay in the diagnosis of diabetes may somewhat obscure the true effect.","['Ankle Fractures', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Diabetes Complications', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Obesity', 'Postoperative Complications', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']",26085532,"[['C26.404.014'], ['E05.318.372.500.875', 'N05.715.360.330.500.875', 'N06.850.520.450.500.875'], ['C19.246.099'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['C18.654.726.500', 'C23.888.144.699.500', 'E01.370.600.115.100.160.120.699.500', 'G07.100.100.160.120.699.500'], ['C23.550.767'], ['G01.910.857'], ['E01.789.800', 'N04.761.559.590.800', 'N05.715.360.575.575.800']]","['Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
Simulated weightlessness and bone metabolism: impairment of insulin effect on alkaline phosphatase activity in bone tissue.,"The effect of simulated weightlessness on bone alkaline phosphatase was investigated after skeletal unloading for up to 4 days. The skeletal unloading was designed by using the model of hindlimb hang in rats. The femoral-diaphyseal fragments obtained from rats bred with skeletal unloading were cultured for 24 h at 37 degrees C in 5% CO2/95% air in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (high glucose). The bone alkaline and acid phosphatase activity were significantly decreased by skeletal unloading. When the bone tissue was cultured with synthetic [Asu1,7] eel calcitonin (3 and 30 nM), the hormone caused a significant increase of alkaline phosphatase activity in the bone tissues from rats with normal and skeletal-unloading. In culture with insulin (1.0 and 10 nM), skeletal unloading impaired the effect on insulin to increase bone alkaline phosphatase activity. Meanwhile, the culture with zinc sulfate (10 and 100 microM), which can increase bone protein synthesis, caused a remarkable elevation of alkaline phosphatase activity in the bone tissues form rats with normal and skeletal-unloading. Insulin (10 nM) did not alter the zinc effect. These findings suggest that the skeletal unloading with hindlimb hang causes the impairment of insulin's effect to increase alkaline phosphatase activity in the femoral diaphysis of rats, although the effects of calcitonin and zinc were not altered.","['Alkaline Phosphatase', 'Animals', 'Bone and Bones', 'Calcitonin', 'Cycloheximide', 'Insulin', 'Male', 'Organ Culture Techniques', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred Strains', 'Sulfates', 'Weightlessness', 'Zinc', 'Zinc Sulfate']",1857890,"[['D08.811.277.352.650.035'], ['B01.050'], ['A02.835.232', 'A10.165.265'], ['D06.472.699.150', 'D06.472.931.052', 'D12.644.400.095', 'D12.644.548.150', 'D12.776.631.650.095'], ['D03.383.621.808.240'], ['D06.472.699.587.200.500.625', 'D12.644.548.586.200.500.625'], ['E05.481.500.484'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700'], ['B01.050.050.199.520.760', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700.400'], ['D01.248.497.158.845', 'D01.875.800.800.850'], ['G01.060.350.369.400.900'], ['D01.268.556.940', 'D01.268.956.906', 'D01.552.544.940'], ['D01.875.800.800.850.950', 'D01.975.987']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Testicular pathology in 46,XY dysgenetic male pseudohermaphroditism: an approach to pathogenesis of testis cancer.","Eleven children with dysgenic male pseudohermaphroditism (DMP) and 18 boys with isolated penile hypospadias, all with 46,XY karyotype, were studied. Testicular dysgenesis was associated with significantly lower testosterone response to human chorionic gonadotropin (0.9 +/- 0.2 ng/mL) than it was in hypospadias (3.3 +/- 0.1 ng/mL), and with significantly higher mean serum follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels (8.4 +/- 2.3 IU/L vs 1.5 +/- 0.3 IU/L). Gonadoblastoma, a tumor that arises from the sex cords, was found in more than 1/4 of patients with DMP, whereas testicular carcinoma in situ (CIS) cells were present in all of these patients. Forty-two percent to 98% of CIS cells revealed an aneuploid pattern of nuclear DNA, indicating that most of them are neoplastic cells. In patients with hypospadias, CIS was not seen, and no other abnormalities were detected. In children with DMP, the percentage of tubules populated with germ cells was significantly lower than it was in those with hypospadias (48.3% +/- 10.6% vs 92.4% +/- 4.0%). The total number of germ cells (CIS cells + spermatogonia) did not differ significantly between the 2 groups, but the number of spermatogonia was significantly reduced in children with DMP (0.08 +/- 0.05 vs 3.65 +/- 0.2), suggesting impaired differentiation of gonocytes to spermatogonia. The following significant correlations were present with DMP: 1) the higher the seminiferous tubule cross-section area, the higher the number of CIS cells (r = 0.78); and 2) the higher the serum gonadotropin levels, the higher were tubular diameter (r = 0.93 for FSH and r = 0.75 for luteinizing hormone [LH]), area (r = 0.79 for FSH and r = 0.82 for LH), percentage of tubules populated with germ cells (r = 0.86 for FSH and r = 0.81 for LH), and number of CIS cells (r = 0.87 for FSH and r = 0.79 for LH). The results indicate that in intersex children with 46,XY karyotype, CIS occurs in dysgenetic testes in all cases and is frequently associated with gonadoblastoma. Impaired organogenesis of sex cords, relative inhibition of testosterone secretion, and the associated increased secretion of gonadotropins may create a milieu that induces or is favorable for the formation or maintenance of neoplastic lesions in dysgenetic testes early in childhood.","['Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disorders of Sex Development', 'Follicle Stimulating Hormone', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Infant', 'Karyotyping', 'Luteinizing Hormone', 'Male', 'Testicular Neoplasms', 'Testis']",11545290,"[['M01.060.406'], ['M01.060.406.448'], ['C12.706.316', 'C13.351.875.253', 'C16.131.939.316', 'C19.391.119'], ['D06.472.699.322.576.288', 'D06.472.699.631.525.343.288', 'D12.644.548.691.525.343.288'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E01.370.225.500.607.512', 'E01.370.225.750.551.512', 'E05.200.500.607.512', 'E05.200.750.551.512', 'E05.478.583', 'H01.158.100.656.234.512', 'H01.158.201.344.512', 'H01.158.201.486.512', 'H01.181.122.573.512', 'H01.181.122.605.512'], ['M01.060.703'], ['E01.370.225.500.385.315', 'E05.200.500.385.315', 'E05.242.385.315', 'E05.393.285.475'], ['D06.472.699.322.576.463', 'D06.472.699.631.525.343.463', 'D12.644.548.691.525.343.463'], ['C04.588.322.762', 'C04.588.945.440.915', 'C12.294.260.937', 'C12.758.409.937', 'C19.344.762', 'C19.391.829.782'], ['A05.360.444.849', 'A05.360.576.782', 'A06.300.312.782']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0

Grammatical characteristics of children's conversational utterances that contain disfluency clusters.,"Selected characteristics of disfluent conversational utterances with and without disfluency clusters were examined in 14 children who stutter (CWS) and 14 children who do not stutter (CWNS). For CWS, utterances with disfluency clusters contained significantly more syllables and clausal constituents than disfluent utterances without clusters, which, in turn, contained significantly more syllables, clauses, and clausal constituents than fluent utterances. For both groups of children, disfluency clusters coincided significantly more often with utterance or clause onset than they did with grammatical constituents located elsewhere within an utterance. CWNS produced a significantly greater percentage of disfluency clusters that contained grammatical revision than did CWS. No significant between-group differences were observed in terms of the number of syllables, clauses, or clausal constituents within cluster-inclusive utterances. Findings are taken to suggest that disfluency clusters are typically produced within the most complex linguistic contexts and that they reflect the effects of producing multiple syntactic constituents within an utterance.","['Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Stuttering', 'Verbal Behavior']",10025545,"[['M01.060.406'], ['M01.060.406.448'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C10.597.606.150.500.800.750', 'C23.888.592.604.150.500.800.750'], ['F01.145.209.908']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]']",0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
Lack of effect of azelastine and ketoconazole coadministration on electrocardiographic parameters in healthy volunteers.,"Azelastine, an antihistamine with additional pharmacologic properties, was evaluated for a possible influence on pharmacokinetic and electrocardiographic parameters due to its coadministration with CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole (200 mg every 12 hrs). Twelve volunteers entered this three-period, open-label study. Electrocardiographic parameters (PR, QRS and QTc intervals and U-wave morphology) were monitored after 14 days of azelastine HCl (4.4 mg every 12 hrs), after 7 days of either azelastine/ketoconazole or azelastine/placebo, and after a 21-day washout period, which was then followed by a 7-day administration of ketoconazole alone. None of the treatments resulted in meaningful alterations of electrocardiographic variables. Pharmacokinetic parameters could not be estimated because ketoconazole metabolites interfered with azelastine assay procedures. In vitro tests with human liver microsomes were used to characterize azelastine's inhibition spectrum. Azelastine did not inhibit CYP3A4 activity but it did inhibit CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 activity with Ki values exceeding maximum plasma concentration by 120 to 800-fold. Therefore, in vitro tests and the absence of electrocardiographic effects suggests azelastine can be safely administered with CYP3A4 inhibitors.","['Adult', 'Antifungal Agents', 'Area Under Curve', 'Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Electrocardiography', 'Heart Rate', 'Histamine H1 Antagonists', 'Humans', 'Ketoconazole', 'Male', 'Phthalazines']",9506001,"[['M01.060.116'], ['D27.505.954.122.136'], ['E05.318.740.200', 'G03.787.101', 'G07.690.725.064', 'N06.850.520.830.200'], ['D08.244.453', 'D08.811.682.690.708.170', 'D12.776.422.220.453'], ['E05.318.370.300', 'E05.581.500.300', 'N05.715.360.325.320', 'N06.850.520.445.300'], ['E01.370.370.380.240', 'E01.370.405.240'], ['E01.370.600.875.500', 'G09.330.380.500'], ['D27.505.519.625.375.425.400', 'D27.505.696.577.375.425.400'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D03.383.606.560'], ['D03.383.710.605']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]']",0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
Glucose lowering effect of aqueous extract of Enicostemma littorale Blume in diabetes: a possible mechanism of action.,Diabetes mellitus is a chronic metabolic disorder characterized by hyperglycemia. Enicostemma littorale Blume is a small herb and recently we have reported its blood glucose lowering potential in alloxan induced diabetic rats. A single dose of aqueous extract of E. littorale (15 g dry plant equivalent extract per kg) had shown significant increase in the serum insulin levels in alloxan-induced diabetic rats at 8 h. The insulinotropic action of aqueous extract of E. littorale was further investigated using rat pancreatic islets. Extract has the potential to enhance glucose-induced insulin release at 11.1 mM glucose from isolated rat pancreatic islets and was partially able to reverse the effect of diazoxide (0.25 mM). Incubation with Ca(2+) chelator (EGTA) and Ca(2+) channel blocker (nimodipine) did not affect the glucose-induced insulin release augmented by the extract.

Assay of hybrid ribonuclease using a membrane filter-immobilized synthetic hybrid: application to the human leukemic cell.,"A method for assaying hybrid ribonuclease has been devised which utilizes as substrate the synthetic hybrid [3H]polyriboadenylic acid [poly(rA)]:polydeoxythymidylic acid [poly(dT)] immobilized on the solid matrix of nitrocellulose filters. The hybridization on filter of [3H]poly(rA) to poly(dT) has been explored in terms of efficacy of the process and the response of the product to RNase H. A pulse of uv irradiation of poly(dT) while in dry state on the filter increased its firm binding to the filter in a concentration-dependent manner, resulting in a concomitant increase of the yield of hybrid formation.

When stored in toluene in the cold the hybrid maintained its stability for over 6 months, as judged by its resistance to RNase A.

Does soccer ball heading cause retinal bleeding?,"OBJECTIVES: To define forces of youth soccer ball heading (headers) and determine whether heading causes retinal hemorrhage.SETTING: Regional Children's Hospital, youth soccer camp.PATIENTS: Male and female soccer players, 13 to 16 years old, who regularly head soccer balls.MEASUREMENTS: Dilated retinal examination, after 2-week header diary, and accelerometer measurement of heading a lofted soccer ball.RESULTS: Twenty-one youth soccer players, averaging 79 headers in the prior 2 weeks, and 3 players who did not submit header diaries lacked retinal hemorrhage. Thirty control subjects also lacked retinal hemorrhage. Seven subjects heading the ball experienced linear cranial accelerations of 3.7 +/- 1.3g. Rotational accelerations were negligible.CONCLUSIONS: Headers, not associated with globe impact, are unlikely to cause retinal hemorrhage. Correctly executed headers did not cause significant rotational acceleration of the head, but incorrectly executed headers might.","['Acceleration', 'Adolescent', 'Athletic Injuries', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Male', 'Retinal Hemorrhage', 'Soccer', 'Washington']",11929366,"[['G01.482.107'], ['M01.060.057'], ['C26.115'], ['E05.318.372.500.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.500'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E05.318.308.985.525.375', 'N01.224.935.597.500', 'N06.850.505.400.975.525.375', 'N06.850.520.308.985.525.375'], ['C11.290.807', 'C11.768.710', 'C23.550.414.756.775'], ['I03.450.642.845.800'], ['Z01.107.567.875.560.900', 'Z01.107.567.875.580.900']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Geographicals [Z]']",0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1

"Identification of Goodpasture target antigens in basement membranes of human glomeruli, lung, and placenta.","Collagenase-digests of human glomerular (GBM), alveolar (ABM), and placenta basement membranes (PBM) were separated by gel filtration columns and the pools rich in Goodpasture antigens (GP) were identified by an antibody inhibition-ELISA. Sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) followed by immunoblotting on nitrocellulose membranes was performed with each basement membrane preparation. Sera from patients with florid GP-syndrome and antibodies to glomerular basement membrane (anti-GBM antibodies) were incubated with nitrocellulose strips of GBM, ABM, and PBM. Immunoperoxidase staining revealed reactivity with target antigens of 24, 26, 44, and 50 kD in the GBM and of 44 and 50 kD in the ABM and PBM, respectively. No corresponding reactivity was observed using convalescent GP-sera, sera from patients with other immunological diseases or sera from healthy blood donors. The antigens were sensitive to reduction. We conclude, that antigens of similar molecular-weights can be identified by anti-GBM positive sera in human glomerular, alveolar and placenta basement membranes.","['Adult', 'Anti-Glomerular Basement Membrane Disease', 'Autoantibodies', 'Autoantigens', 'Basement Membrane', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Humans', 'Kidney Glomerulus', 'Placenta', 'Pulmonary Alveoli']",3608225,"[['M01.060.116'], ['C08.381.483.156', 'C12.777.419.570.363.304', 'C13.351.968.419.570.363.304', 'C20.111.190'], ['D12.776.124.486.485.114.323', 'D12.776.124.790.651.114.323', 'D12.776.377.715.548.114.323'], ['D23.050.422'], ['A10.272.220', 'A10.615.179'], ['E05.196.401.402', 'E05.301.300.319'], ['E05.478.566.350.170', 'E05.478.566.380.360', 'E05.478.583.400.170', 'E05.601.470.350.170', 'E05.601.470.380.360'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['A05.810.453.324.359', 'A05.810.453.736.520'], ['A16.710'], ['A04.411.715']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
De Novo Missense Mutations in DHX30 Impair Global Translation and Cause a Neurodevelopmental Disorder.,"DHX30 is a member of the family of DExH-box helicases, which use ATP hydrolysis to unwind RNA secondary structures. Here we identified six different de novo missense mutations in DHX30 in twelve unrelated individuals affected by global developmental delay (GDD), intellectual disability (ID), severe speech impairment and gait abnormalities. While four mutations are recurrent, two are unique with one affecting the codon of one recurrent mutation. All amino acid changes are located within highly conserved helicase motifs and were found to either impair ATPase activity or RNA recognition in different in vitro assays. Moreover, protein variants exhibit an increased propensity to trigger stress granule (SG) formation resulting in global translation inhibition. Thus, our findings highlight the prominent role of translation control in development and function of the central nervous system and also provide molecular insight into how DHX30 dysfunction might cause a neurodevelopmental disorder.","['Adenosine Triphosphatases', 'Adolescent', 'Amino Acids', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Central Nervous System', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Developmental Disabilities', 'Female', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Intellectual Disability', 'Male', 'Mutation, Missense', 'RNA', 'RNA Helicases']",29100085,"[['D08.811.277.040.025'], ['M01.060.057'], ['D12.125'], ['A11.251.210'], ['A11.251.210.190', 'A11.251.860.180'], ['A08.186'], ['M01.060.406'], ['M01.060.406.448'], ['F03.625.421'], ['A11.251.210.172.750', 'A11.436.334'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C10.597.606.360', 'C23.888.592.604.646', 'F01.700.687', 'F03.625.539'], ['G05.365.590.650'], ['D13.444.735'], ['D08.811.913.696.445.735.720']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
Monoclonal antibodies to human thioredoxin reductase.,"The thioredoxin system consisting of thioredoxin (Trx), thioredoxin reductase (TrxR), and NADPH is an electron donor for ribonucleotide reductase but has also been implicated in other cellular events, including secretion, growth promotion, regulation of transcription factors, protection against oxidative stress, and apoptosis. Mammalian TrxR is a dimeric flavoprotein with 58 kDa subunits each with a catalytically active selenocysteine residue. To study the function and expression of TrxR, we have produced and characterized, for the first time, monoclonal antibodies against human TrxR. Native placenta TrxR was used for immunization of BALB/c mice, followed by hybridization, cloning, and establishment of hybridomas producing specific antibodies against human TrxR. Three clones of IgG1, kappa subclass, termed anti-TrxR1, anti-TrxR2, and anti-TrxR3, were studied in detail. The isoelectric points (pIs) of the mAbs were 6.5, 6.0, and 6.5, respectively. The affinities (Ka) of the mAbs were 2 x 10(8) M-1. Inhibition ELISA using biotin-labeled versus nonconjugated mAb IgG revealed that all three mAbs recognized one immunodominant epitope. Western blot analysis showed that the antibodies specifically bound to a 58 kDa protein, representing the subunit of TrxR. A Trx-dependent insulin reduction assay was used for analysis of enzymatic activity and the antibodies neutralized the reductase activity.","['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antibody Affinity', 'Antibody Specificity', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Thioredoxin-Disulfide Reductase']",9705836,"[['B01.050'], ['D12.776.124.486.485.114.224', 'D12.776.124.790.651.114.224', 'D12.776.377.715.548.114.224'], ['G12.040', 'G12.122.125'], ['G12.100'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500'], ['B01.050.050.199.520.520.338', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500.400.338'], ['D08.811.682.667.750', 'D12.776.331.971']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Effects of mivacurium on the diaphragm evaluated by cervical magnetic stimulation of the phrenic nerves.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents have differential effects on the diaphragm and skeletal muscles. We employed a new method to study the effects of mivacurium on the diaphragm and compared the results obtained with this method with published data.METHODS: Anaesthesia was induced and maintained with propofol and alfentanil and the trachea was intubated after topical anaesthesia. Contractions of the diaphragm were induced by cervical magnetic stimulation of the phrenic nerves and quantified by measuring airway pressure responses. The neuromuscular effects on skeletal muscles were measured by acceleromyography of the adductor pollicis muscle. Mivacurium (0.15 mg kg(-1)) was injected and neuromuscular responses were recorded until the effects had waned.RESULTS: Eleven male and 10 female patients (ASA I-II; 57 +/- 16 yr; 78 +/- 13 kg; mean +/- standard deviation) participated. Median maximal reduction of twitch response was less (P < 0.05) for the diaphragm (89%) than for the adductor pollicis (100%). Time to 25% recovery was shorter for the diaphragm than for the adductor pollicis (8.8 +/- 2.2 min vs. 22.6 +/- 5.0 min, P < 0.05). The difference between the recovery index of the diaphragm (7.3 min (3.6-18.4)) and the adductor pollicis (8.2 min (4.4-20.9) (median (range)) just missed our chosen level of statistical significance (P = 0.06). The recovery time to train-of-four 0.8 was shorter for the diaphragm (median and 95% confidence interval 25.1 +/- 10.2 min) than for the adductor pollicis (median and 95% confidence interval 37.5 +/- 9.4 min, P < 0.05).CONCLUSIONS: The duration of the clinical effect of mivacurium on the diaphragm is markedly shorter than on the adductor pollicis muscles but there was only a small difference in the recovery index of the two muscles. These effects and the time courses determined with the new method closely resemble the results obtained with different methods in other studies.","['Aged', 'Alfentanil', 'Anesthesia', 'Anesthesia, Intravenous', 'Anesthetics, Intravenous', 'Diaphragm', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Electromagnetic Fields', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Isoquinolines', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mivacurium', 'Muscle Contraction', 'Myography', 'Neuromuscular Nondepolarizing Agents', 'Phrenic Nerve', 'Propofol']",16045143,"[['M01.060.116.100'], ['D03.383.621.265.100'], ['E03.155'], ['E03.155.308'], ['D27.505.696.277.100.035.075', 'D27.505.954.427.210.100.035.075'], ['A02.633.567.900.300'], ['E05.723.402'], ['G01.358.500.260', 'G01.358.750.500'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D03.633.100.531'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['D03.633.100.531.430'], ['G11.427.494'], ['E01.370.530'], ['D27.505.696.663.700.710.575'], ['A08.800.800.720.150.700'], ['D02.455.426.559.389.657.773']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

Cytochemical localization and biochemical evaluation of a lysosomal serine protease in lung: dipeptidyl peptidase II in the normal rat.,"Dipeptidyl peptidase II (DPP II) in normal rat lung was evaluated by the enzymes' ability to hydrolyze Lys-Ala or Lys-Pro derivatives of 4-methoxy-2-naphthylamine (MNA). For visualization of this activity, the liberated MNA was coupled with fast blue B for light microscopy (LM) or hexazotized pararosaniline with osmication for electron microscopy (EM). Granular to diffuse reaction product was noted in many lung cells in frozen sections for LM, including alveolar and tissue macrophages, fibroblasts, chondrocytes, bronchial and bronchiolar epithelial cells and mast cells. Reaction product at the EM level was seen in the lysosomal structures of the above cells, although lysosomal heterogeneity with regard to reactivity was noted. Cellular content of reaction product by EM correlated with LM staining intensity. Additional structures, not obviously reactive by LM, such as the lamellar bodies of type II cells and lysosomes in other cell types, were seen to contain reaction product ultrastructurally. A modified biochemical assay for the quantitation of DPP II in tissue homogenates was used to determine the activity of the enzyme in rat lung. Enzyme activity in polyacrylamide isoelectric focusing gels indicate that Lys-Ala-MNA was the more specific substrate but, by virtue of its rapid hydrolysis, Lys-Pro-MNA was more sensitive.","['2-Naphthylamine', 'Alanine', 'Animals', 'Dipeptidyl-Peptidases and Tripeptidyl-Peptidases', 'Endopeptidases', 'Histocytochemistry', 'Isoelectric Focusing', 'Lung', 'Lysine', 'Lysosomes', 'Male', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Proline', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred Strains']",3924993,"[['D02.092.710', 'D02.455.426.559.847.638.850', 'D04.615.638.850'], ['D12.125.042'], ['B01.050'], ['D08.811.277.656.350.350'], ['D08.811.277.656.300'], ['E01.370.225.500.607', 'E01.370.225.750.551', 'E05.200.500.607', 'E05.200.750.551', 'H01.158.100.656.234', 'H01.158.201.344', 'H01.181.122.573'], ['E05.196.401.663', 'E05.301.300.663'], ['A04.411'], ['D12.125.068.555', 'D12.125.095.647', 'D12.125.142.497'], ['A11.284.430.214.190.875.190.550'], ['E01.370.350.515.402', 'E05.595.402'], ['D12.125.072.401.623'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700'], ['B01.050.050.199.520.760', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700.400']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
Pneumococcal behavior and host responses during bronchopneumonia are affected differently by the cytolytic and complement-activating activities of pneumolysin.,"Pneumolysin, a multifunctional toxin produced by all clinical isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae, is strongly implicated in the pathogenesis of pneumococcal bronchopneumonia and septicemia. Using isogenic mutant strains, we examined the effect of deletion of the cytotoxic activity or complement-activating activity of pneumolysin on bacterial growth in lungs and blood, histological changes in infected lung tissue, and the pattern of inflammatory cell recruitment. Both of the activities of pneumolysin contributed to the pathology in the lungs, as well as the timing of the onset of bacteremia. Histological changes in the lungs were delayed after infection with either mutant compared to the changes seen after infection with the wild-type pneumococcus. The complement-activating activity of pneumolysin affected the accumulation of T cells, whereas the toxin's cytolytic activity influenced neutrophil recruitment into lung tissue.","['Animals', 'Bacteremia', 'Bacterial Proteins', 'Bronchopneumonia', 'Complement Activation', 'Cytotoxins', 'Female', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Lung', 'Mice', 'Pneumonia, Pneumococcal', 'Streptococcus pneumoniae', 'Streptolysins']",12654795,"[['B01.050'], ['C01.150.252.100', 'C01.757.100', 'C23.550.470.790.500.100'], ['D12.776.097'], ['C01.748.610.127', 'C08.127.509', 'C08.381.677.127', 'C08.730.610.127'], ['G12.274'], ['D27.888.569.213'], ['E01.370.225.500.607.512', 'E01.370.225.750.551.512', 'E05.200.500.607.512', 'E05.200.750.551.512', 'E05.478.583', 'H01.158.100.656.234.512', 'H01.158.201.344.512', 'H01.158.201.486.512', 'H01.181.122.573.512', 'H01.181.122.605.512'], ['A04.411'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500'], ['C01.150.252.410.890.670.750', 'C01.150.252.620.550', 'C01.748.610.540.550', 'C08.381.677.540.550', 'C08.730.610.540.550'], ['B03.353.750.737.872.550', 'B03.510.400.800.872.550', 'B03.510.550.737.872.550'], ['D12.776.543.695.937', 'D23.946.123.868', 'D23.946.350.750']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
Diagnosis of myeloproliferative disease by analysis of the platelet volume distribution.,"Analysis of platelet volume distribution curves was performed on whole blood specimens from patients with myeloproliferative disease, reactive thrombocytosis, and a control group. Estimates of the mean platelet volume and megathrombocyte index were made using either the maximum height or the area under the curve. Also, a lognormal curve was fitted to the data, providing a measure of the dispersion and another estimate of the mean platelet volume. An index expression the breadth of the distribution was derived from the ratio of megathrombocyte index to estimated mean volume. The control and reactive thrombocytosis groups were indistinguishable except for mean platelet count. The mean platelet volume and megathrombocyte index did not provide a useful separation of the myeloproliferative disease group from the other, however their ratios, when considered together with the dispersion of the distribution, enabled a distinction to be made in most cases. Thus, analysis of the platelet volume distribution is useful in detecting the presence of myeloproliferative disease.","['Acute Disease', 'Aged', 'Aging', 'Clone Cells', 'Edetic Acid', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders', 'Platelet Aggregation', 'Platelet Count', 'Thrombocytosis']",6794355,"[['C23.550.291.125'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['G07.345.124'], ['A11.251.353'], ['D02.092.782.258.368.250', 'D02.241.081.018.253'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C04.557.337'], ['C04.557.337.539.275'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['C15.378.190.636'], ['G09.188.370.687', 'G09.188.390.600.640'], ['E01.370.225.500.195.107.740', 'E01.370.225.625.107.700', 'E01.370.225.625.625.625', 'E05.200.500.195.107.740', 'E05.200.625.107.700', 'E05.200.625.625.625', 'E05.242.195.107.740', 'G04.140.107.740', 'G09.188.105.700'], ['C15.378.140.860', 'C15.378.190.636.860']]","['Diseases [C]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
Finite difference modelling of the temperature rise in non-linear medical ultrasound fields.,"Non-linear propagation of ultrasound can lead to increased heat generation in medical diagnostic imaging due to the preferential absorption of harmonics of the original frequency. A numerical model has been developed and tested that is capable of predicting the temperature rise due to a high amplitude ultrasound field. The acoustic field is modelled using a numerical solution to the Khokhlov-Zabolotskaya-Kuznetsov (KZK) equation, known as the Bergen Code, which is implemented in cylindrical symmetric form. A finite difference representation of the thermal equations is used to calculate the resulting temperature rises. The model allows for the inclusion of a number of layers of tissue with different acoustic and thermal properties and accounts for the effects of non-linear propagation, direct heating by the transducer, thermal diffusion and perfusion in different tissues. The effect of temperature-dependent skin perfusion and variation in background temperature between the skin and deeper layers of the body are included. The model has been tested against analytic solutions for simple configurations and then used to estimate temperature rises in realistic obstetric situations. A pulsed 3 MHz transducer operating with an average acoustic power of 200 mW leads to a maximum steady state temperature rise inside the foetus of 1.25 degrees C compared with a 0.6 degree C rise for the same transmitted power under linear propagation conditions. The largest temperature rise occurs at the skin surface, with the temperature rise at the foetus limited to less than 2 degrees C for the range of conditions considered.","['Acoustics', 'Models, Theoretical', 'Nonlinear Dynamics', 'Skin', 'Skin Temperature', 'Ultrasonography, Prenatal']",10829673,"[['H01.671.031'], ['E05.599'], ['E05.599.850', 'H01.548.675'], ['A17.815'], ['G07.110.753', 'G13.750.844'], ['E01.370.350.850.865', 'E01.370.378.630.865']]","['Disciplines and Occupations [H]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",1,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
Men's sexual response to female partner's intranasal oxytocin administration for hypoactive sexual desire disorder: an open prospective cohort study.,"OBJECTIVE: To study sexual function, quality of life, and depression in men, whose female partners are undergoing double-blind placebo-controlled randomized treatment for hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD).DESIGN: Open prospective cohort study of 22 weeks.SETTING: Academic medical center.PATIENT(S): Male partners of 30 premenopausal and postmenopausal women with HSDD.INTERVENTION(S): Baseline, 3-month, and 5-month assessment (for 8 weeks each) of male response to female partner's use of oxytocin nasal spray (32 IE) and placebo within 50 minutes before sexual intercourse.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Primary outcome parameters were Sexual Life Quality Questionnaire-Male, Sexual Activity Record, Partner Performance Questionnaire, and Hamilton Depression Scale.RESULT(S): Male Sexual Life Quality questionnaire improved significantly from -7.4 ± 9.9 at baseline to 8.2 ± 12 with female partners' treatment with oxytocin nasal spray and to 10.8 ± 13.8 with placebo. Frequency of intercourse improved slightly but not significantly from 6.3 ± 3.9 at baseline to 7.3 ± 4 with female oxytocin therapy, but not with placebo. Male desire and arousal remained stable throughout the study period. Evaluation of female partners' performance by men improved significantly from 8.9 ± 2.8 at baseline to 10.6 ± 2.2 with oxytocin and to 11.2 ± 2.6 with placebo.CONCLUSION(S): Female treatment with either oxytocin or placebo for HSDD significantly improves male sexual quality of life and evaluation of female partner's sexual performance with no difference between oxytocin and placebo on any outcome parameters.

A serum factor stimulating cathepsin D-release from erythrocytes or ghosts.,"A serum factor preparation extensively purified from bovine serum stimulated cathepsin D-release from the rat blood cells in a concentration-dependent fashion within a range of physiological concentrations of the factor. Among the blood cells only the erythrocytes (or ghosts) were responsive to the factor, and the leucocytes and lymphocytes were unresponsive. The effects of Ca2+-concentrations, SH- blocking reagents, protease-inhibitors, calmodulin-inhibitors, calmodulin or EGTA-pretreatment of the ghosts on cathepsin D-release from the erythrocytes of ghosts in the presence or the absence of serum factor were investigated. The results suggested that the serum factor may first activate the Ca2+-calmodulin system via the mobilization of ""Ca2+-pool"" and then the calmodulin-dependent SH-protease in the erythrocyte plasma membranes. The activated protease in turn may break the linkage between cathepsin D and the plasma membranes, liberating cathepsin D activity into the incubation medium. The name of ""calciferin"" was proposed for the serum factor.","['Animals', 'Calcium', 'Calmodulin', 'Cathepsin D', 'Cathepsins', 'Cysteine Endopeptidases', 'Endopeptidases', 'Erythrocyte Membrane', 'Erythrocytes', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Male', 'Parathyroid Hormone', 'Protease Inhibitors', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred Strains']",6368282,"[['B01.050'], ['D01.268.552.100', 'D01.552.539.288', 'D23.119.100'], ['D12.644.360.372.249', 'D12.776.157.125.412.249', 'D12.776.476.387.249'], ['D08.811.277.656.074.500.180', 'D08.811.277.656.224.187', 'D08.811.277.656.300.048.180'], ['D08.811.277.656.224'], ['D08.811.277.656.262.500', 'D08.811.277.656.300.200'], ['D08.811.277.656.300'], ['A11.118.290.270', 'A11.284.149.356', 'A15.145.229.334.270'], ['A11.118.290', 'A11.443.240', 'A15.145.229.334'], ['E05.481'], ['D06.472.699.590', 'D12.644.548.587'], ['D27.505.519.389.745'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700'], ['B01.050.050.199.520.760', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700.400']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Mitochondrial Lon protease is a human stress protein.,"The targeted removal of damaged proteins by proteolysis is crucial for cell survival. We have shown previously that the Lon protease selectively degrades oxidized mitochondrial proteins, thus preventing their aggregation and cross-linking. We now show that the Lon protease is a stress-responsive protein that is induced by multiple stressors, including heat shock, serum starvation, and oxidative stress. Lon induction, by pretreatment with low-level stress, protects against oxidative protein damage, diminished mitochondrial function, and loss of cell proliferation induced by toxic levels of hydrogen peroxide. Blocking Lon induction with Lon siRNA also blocks this induced protection. We propose that Lon is a generalized stress-protective enzyme whose decline may contribute to the increased levels of protein damage and mitochondrial dysfunction observed in aging and age-related diseases.","['Aging', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Survival', 'Culture Media, Serum-Free', 'Free Radicals', 'Heat-Shock Proteins', 'Hot Temperature', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide', 'Mitochondria', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Protease La', 'Protein Carbonylation', 'RNA, Small Interfering']",19439239,"[['G07.345.124'], ['A11.251.210.190', 'A11.251.860.180'], ['G04.161.750', 'G07.345.249.410.750'], ['G04.346'], ['D27.720.470.305.255', 'E07.206.255'], ['D01.339', 'D02.389'], ['D12.776.580.216'], ['G01.906.595.543', 'G16.500.275.063.725.710.380', 'G16.500.750.775.710.380', 'N06.230.300.100.725.232', 'N06.230.300.100.725.710.380'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D01.248.497.158.685.750.424', 'D01.339.431.374.424', 'D01.650.550.750.400', 'D02.389.338.253'], ['A11.284.430.214.190.875.564', 'A11.284.835.626'], ['G03.673', 'G07.775.750'], ['D08.811.277.040.013.500.032.099.750', 'D08.811.277.040.025.024.032.099.750', 'D08.811.277.656.149.099.750', 'D08.811.277.656.300.065.750', 'D12.776.157.025.750.032.099.750'], ['G02.111.660.871.790.600.350', 'G02.111.691.600.350', 'G03.673.690', 'G03.734.871.790.600.350', 'G05.308.670.600.350', 'G07.775.750.750'], ['D13.150.650.700', 'D13.444.735.150.700', 'D13.444.735.790.552.875']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
Dietary supplementation with dried plum prevents ovariectomy-induced bone loss while modulating the immune response in C57BL/6J mice.,"This study was designed to investigate the effects of dried plum on the changes in bone metabolism and the immune response associated with ovarian hormone deficiency. Adult female C57BL/6J mice were either sham-operated (Sham) and fed AIN-93 diet (control) or ovariectomized (OVX) and fed a control diet with 0%, 5%, 15% or 25% dried plum (w/w), corresponding to control, low- (LDP), medium- (MDP) and high (HDP)-dose dried plum. Four weeks of HDP supplementation prevented the decrease in spine bone mineral density and content induced by OVX. The OVX compromise in trabecular bone of the vertebra and proximal tibia was prevented by the higher doses of dried plum, and in the vertebra these effects resulted in greater (P<.05) bone strength and stiffness. In the bone marrow, OVX suppressed granulocyte and committed monocyte populations and increased the lymphoblast population, but the MDP and HDP restored these myeloid and lymphoid populations to the level of the Sham. Dried plum also suppressed lymphocyte tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-á production ex vivo by splenocytes, in response to concanavalin (Con) A stimulation. These data indicate that dried plum's positive effects on bone structural and biomechanical properties coincide with the restoration of certain bone marrow myeloid and lymphoid populations, and suppressed splenocyte activation occurring with ovarian hormone deficiency.","['Animals', 'Biomarkers', 'Body Weight', 'Bone Density', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Bone and Bones', 'Concanavalin A', 'Cytokines', 'Dietary Supplements', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Eating', 'Female', 'Femur', 'Gene Expression', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor I', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Organ Size', 'Osteoporosis', 'Ovariectomy', 'Peptide Fragments', 'Procollagen', 'Prunus', 'Spleen', 'Tibia', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha', 'Uterus']",21414765,"[['B01.050'], ['D23.101'], ['C23.888.144', 'E01.370.600.115.100.160.120', 'E05.041.124.160.750', 'G07.100.100.160.120', 'G07.345.249.314.120'], ['G11.427.100'], ['A11.148', 'A15.378.316'], ['A02.835.232', 'A10.165.265'], ['D12.776.503.499.500', 'D12.776.765.678.500'], ['D12.644.276.374', 'D12.776.467.374', 'D23.529.374'], ['G07.203.300.456', 'J02.500.456'], ['C22.232', 'E05.598.500', 'E05.599.395.080'], ['G07.203.650.283', 'G10.261.330'], ['A02.835.232.043.150'], ['G05.297'], ['D12.644.276.937.400', 'D12.776.124.862.400', 'D12.776.467.937.400', 'D23.529.937.400'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500'], ['B01.050.050.199.520.520.420', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500.400.420'], ['E01.370.600.115.100.660', 'E05.041.124.715', 'G07.100.100.660', 'G07.345.249.690'], ['C05.116.198.579', 'C18.452.104.579'], ['E04.270.282.685', 'E04.950.165.685', 'E04.950.300.680'], ['D12.644.541'], ['D12.776.811.690', 'D12.776.860.300.250.600'], ['B01.650.940.800.575.912.250.859.937.500.625'], ['A10.549.700', 'A15.382.520.604.700'], ['A02.835.232.043.650.883'], ['D12.644.276.374.500.800', 'D12.644.276.374.750.626', 'D12.776.124.900', 'D12.776.395.930', 'D12.776.467.374.500.800', 'D12.776.467.374.750.626', 'D23.529.374.500.800', 'D23.529.374.750.626'], ['A05.360.319.679']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
"Concussion Attitudes and Beliefs, Knowledge, and Clinical Practice: Survey of Physical Therapists.","BACKGROUND: A concussion is considered a mild traumatic brain injury that may cause physical, cognitive, affective, and sleep dysfunction. Physical therapists have been identified as health care providers involved in the multidisciplinary care of a patient with concussion.OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to describe the current attitudes and beliefs, knowledge, and practice of physical therapists in the treatment of patients with concussion.METHODS: A 55-question electronic survey divided into 6 sections-(1) demographics, (2) current practice in concussion, (3) youth concussion legislation, (4) attitudes and beliefs toward concussion management, (5) concussion knowledge, and (6) clinical decision making-was developed and distributed online through selected American Physical Therapy Association sections.RESULTS: A total of 1,272 physical therapists completed the survey. Seventy percent of the respondents (n=894) reported having concussion training. Although supportive of the role of the physical therapist in the treatment of a person with concussion, the respondents demonstrated less confidence when making return-to-play decisions. Respondents correctly answered, on average, 13 (out of 15) concussion knowledge questions, with gaps exhibited in understanding the clinical utilization of concussion severity scales, the conservative treatment of youth who sustain a concussion, and anticipated normal computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging after a concussion. When provided with clinical scenarios, respondents were able to recognize when a referral to a physician was indicated; however, they demonstrated variability in identifying a need for vestibular or manual physical therapy.LIMITATIONS: Convenience sampling was utilized, limiting generalizability of the results of the study to the physical therapy profession as a whole.CONCLUSION: Physical therapists demonstrated a solid foundation of concussion knowledge, but gaps still existed. Future professional development opportunities should be developed to target identified gaps in knowledge and current practice patterns.","['Adult', 'Attitude of Health Personnel', 'Brain Concussion', 'Clinical Competence', 'Decision Making', 'Female', 'Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Physical Therapists', 'Referral and Consultation', 'Return to Sport', 'Self Efficacy', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Trauma Severity Indices']",26637654,"[['M01.060.116'], ['F01.100.050', 'N05.300.100'], ['C10.228.140.199.444.250', 'C10.900.300.087.235.250', 'C10.900.300.350.300', 'C26.915.300.200.194.250', 'C26.915.300.450.500', 'C26.974.382.200'], ['I02.399.630.210', 'N04.761.210', 'N05.715.175'], ['F02.463.785.373'], ['F01.100.150.500', 'N05.300.150.410'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['M01.526.485.790', 'N02.360.790'], ['N04.452.758.849'], ['I03.450.642.845.605'], ['F01.752.747.792.700'], ['E05.318.308.980', 'N05.715.360.300.800', 'N06.850.520.308.980'], ['E05.318.308.940.968.875', 'E05.944', 'N04.452.859.564.800', 'N05.715.360.300.715.500.800', 'N06.850.520.308.940.968.875']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0
Nerve conduction velocity in human limbs with late sequelae after local cold injury.,Cold-induced neuropathy may play a dominant role in the long-term sequelae with cold sensitivity after local cold injuries (LCIs). Somatosensory functions were assessed and nerve conduction velocity (NCV) and motor distal delay (MDD) were measured in the limbs of 31 Norwegian former soldiers with persistent cold intolerance 3-4 years after the primary LCI. NCV measurements were performed in 24 lower and 16 upper extremities. NCV was related to degree of overall subjective complaints quantified by means of a visual analogue scale (VAS). Motor (MNCV) and sensory conduction velocity (SNCV) in the lower extremities and SNCV in the hands were significantly decreased compared with controls. MDD was pathologically increased in the feet. NCV of the forearms ranged from normal to significant reduction. The more pronounced effect on the lower extremities may be caused by deeper cooling of the calves compared with forearms for several reasons. No significant associations were found between VAS and NCV except for the right median nerve. NCV measurements may provide objective findings in cold-injured patients and in those with few or no conspicuous clinical signs.,"['Adult', 'Cold Temperature', 'Forearm', 'Frostbite', 'Humans', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Leg', 'Motor Neurons', 'Neural Conduction', 'Neurons, Afferent', 'Pain Measurement']",8817155,"[['M01.060.116'], ['G01.906.595.272', 'G16.500.275.063.725.710.300', 'G16.500.750.775.710.300', 'N06.230.300.100.725.154', 'N06.230.300.100.725.710.300'], ['A01.378.800.585'], ['C26.212.500', 'C26.417'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C20.543'], ['A01.378.610.500'], ['A08.675.655.500', 'A11.671.655.500'], ['G07.265.753', 'G11.561.601'], ['A08.675.650', 'A11.671.650'], ['E01.370.600.550.324']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
Concomitant replacement of language and mtDNA in South Caspian populations of Iran.,"The Gilaki and Mazandarani occupy the South Caspian region of Iran and speak languages belonging to the North-Western branch of Iranian languages . It has been suggested that their ancestors came from the Caucasus region, perhaps displacing an earlier group in the South Caspian . Linguistic evidence supports this scenario, in that the Gilaki and Mazandarani languages (but not other Iranian languages) share certain typological features with Caucasian languages . We analyzed patterns of mtDNA and Y chromosome variation in the Gilaki and Mazandarani. Based on mtDNA HV1 sequences, the Gilaki and Mazandarani most closely resemble their geographic and linguistic neighbors, namely other Iranian groups. However, their Y chromosome types most closely resemble those found in groups from the South Caucasus. A scenario that explains these differences is a south Caucasian origin for the ancestors of the Gilaki and Mazandarani, followed by introgression of women (but not men) from local Iranian groups, possibly because of patrilocality. Given that both mtDNA and language are maternally transmitted, the incorporation of local Iranian women would have resulted in the concomitant replacement of the ancestral Caucasian language and mtDNA types of the Gilaki and Mazandarani with their current Iranian language and mtDNA types. Concomitant replacement of language and mtDNA may be a more general phenomenon than previously recognized.","['Chromosomes, Human, Y', 'DNA, Mitochondrial', 'Female', 'Genetics, Population', 'Geography', 'Haplotypes', 'Humans', 'Iran', 'Language', 'Male', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide']",16581511,"[['A11.284.187.520.300.505.757', 'A11.284.187.865.983.500', 'G05.360.162.520.300.505.757', 'G05.360.162.865.983.500'], ['D13.444.308.283.225'], ['H01.158.273.343.335'], ['H01.277.500'], ['G05.380.360'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['Z01.252.245.500.350'], ['F01.145.209.399', 'L01.559'], ['G05.365.795.598']]","['Anatomy [A]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Information Science [L]']",1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1

Eye health outreach services in the Pacific Islands region: an updated profile.,"BACKGROUND: Anecdotal reports indicate a decreasing number of patients presenting for assessment, and in particular a reduction in the number of patients requiring cataract surgery in Pacific Island Countries (PICs). Furthermore, research and routine surveillance is uncommon.AIM: To analyse and describe the records of eye health outreach clinics from a single provider in seven Pacific Islands.METHOD: Routine data collected at the Fred Hollows Foundation eye health outreach clinics in Fiji, Kiribati, Papua New Guinea (PNG), Samoa, the Solomon Islands, Tonga and Vanuatu between 2009 and 2013 were analysed.RESULTS: Over the study period the number of patients treated per clinic fell in Fiji, Samoa and the Solomon Islands. Data from PNG show a higher mean number of patients per clinic and the numbers of patients presenting at PNG outreach clinics appears to be increasing. Cataract was the main eye health condition for between 40%-70% of visits overall, but this range varied between 14% (PNG) and 94% (Fiji). In all countries, males were more likely to receive cataract surgery than females. Refractive error was the most common presenting complaint at PNG outreach clinics; diabetic retinopathy was most common in Tonga. Cases of trachoma or trichiasis were identified in all countries, excepting Kiribati, Samoa and Tonga.CONCLUSION: Data from outreach eye health clinics show marked differences between PICs in the most common presenting conditions. In three countries, it appears there has recently been a reduction in the overall number of patients presenting for treatment. Cautious interpretation of the data is required due to concern about data completeness and quality.","['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Distribution', 'Aged', 'Ambulatory Care Facilities', 'Community Health Services', 'Community Networks', 'Community-Institutional Relations', 'Eye Diseases', 'Female', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pacific Islands', 'Vision Disorders']",26367510,"[['M01.060.057'], ['M01.060.116'], ['I01.240.050', 'N01.224.033', 'N06.850.505.400.050'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['N02.278.035'], ['N02.421.143'], ['I01.880.853.500.300', 'L01.313.500.750.300.184', 'N02.421.143.202'], ['N04.452.822.210'], ['C11'], ['N04.590.374.350', 'N05.300.430'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['Z01.639.760', 'Z01.678.100.873'], ['C10.597.751.941', 'C11.966', 'C23.888.592.763.941']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Geographicals [Z]']",0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,1
Cost Efficacy of Metal Stents for Palliation of Extrahepatic Bile Duct Obstruction in a Randomized Controlled Trial.,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: Endoscopic stents are placed for palliation of extrahepatic bile duct obstruction. Although self-expandable metal stents (SEMS) remain patent longer than plastic stents, they are more expensive. We aimed to evaluate which type of stent (plastic, uncovered SEMS [uSEMS], or partially covered SEMS [pcSEMS]) is the most effective and we assessed costs.METHODS: We performed a multicenter randomized trial in 219 patients at 18 hospitals in The Netherlands from February 2008 through February 2013. Patients were assigned randomly for placement of a plastic stent (n = 73), uSEMS (n = 75), or pcSEMS (n = 71) during endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography. Patients were followed up for up to 1 year. Researchers were not blinded to groups. The main study end points included functional stent time and costs.RESULTS: The mean functional stent times were 172 days for plastic stents, 288 days for uSEMS, and 299 days for pcSEMS (P < .005 for uSEMS and pcSEMS vs plastic). The initial placement of plastic stents (€1042 or $1106) cost significantly less than placement of SEMS (€1973 or $2094) (P = .001). However, the total cost per patient at the end of the follow-up period did not differ significantly between plastic stents (€7320 or $7770) and SEMS (€6932 or $7356) (P = .61). Furthermore, in patients with short survival times (?3 mo) or metastatic disease, the total cost per patient did not differ between plastic stents and SEMS. No differences in costs were found between pcSEMS and uSEMS.CONCLUSIONS: Although placement of SEMS (uncovered or partially covered) for palliation of extrahepatic bile duct obstruction initially is more expensive than placement of plastic stents, SEMS have longer functional time. The total costs after 1 year do not differ significantly with stent type.

Angiosarcoma associated with germ cell tumors.,"In two patients with malignant germ cell tumors angiosarcoma developed through two apparently different mechanisms. In one case the angiosarcoma probably developed as a complication of therapeutic radiation, since radiation changes were demonstrated in tissue adjacent to the neoplasm and since the angiosarcoma was not associated with elements of germ cell tumor. The absence of associated germ cell elements does not support the development of the angiosarcoma from a teratoma. In the second case, however, it is likely that the angiosarcoma developed as a result of malignant change within teratomatous foci, since angiosarcomatous elements were intermingled with teratomatous elements and the patient's primary germ cell tumor contained malignant and atypical teratomatous elements as well as prominent vascular proliferation. Malignant change within teratomatous components of germ cell tumors is a phenomenon of increasing importance in this era of effective chemotherapy for germ cell tumors.

[Results of 75 lung transplantations performed in Groningen in 1990-1995. Lung Transplantation Group Groningen].,"OBJECTIVE: To describe the development of the lung transplantation programme in Groningen, and the results of single and bilateral lung transplantations in the first 75 consecutive patients, up to December 1995.DESIGN: Retrospective.SETTING: Academic Hospital Groningen, the Netherlands.METHODS: The results of the lung transplantation programme were evaluated retrospectively.RESULTS: In November 1990 the first unilateral lung transplantation was performed in Groningen in a patient with pulmonary fibrosis. In February 1991 a national lung transplantation programme for the Netherlands was instituted in Groningen by the government. Of 500 patients referred from all over the Netherlands from 1990 to December 1995, 75 were transplanted, 16 unilaterally and 59 bilaterally. The actuarial survival for all patients was 85% after 1 year and 72% after 2 years. After transplantation 16 patients died (21%) after 15 months follow-up (median). Early mortality (5%) was caused by graft failure, late mortality (16%) by chronic rejection and lymphoproliferative disease. The mean time on the transplantation waiting list was 9.3 months; it increased during the programme. The limiting factor for further expansion of the programme was caused by donor scarcity. The lungs from only 16% of the multiorgan donors reported by Eurotransplant to our centre could be transplanted.CONCLUSION: The results of the lung transplantation programme in Groningen are good but with an increasing number of lung transplantation centres in the Eurotransplant region the further development of lung transplantation in the Netherlands will depend mainly on the availability of lung donors from the Netherlands.","['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Cystic Fibrosis', 'Humans', 'Hypertension, Pulmonary', 'Lung Diseases', 'Lung Transplantation', 'Middle Aged', 'Netherlands', 'Patient Selection', 'Pulmonary Fibrosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate', 'Tissue Donors', 'Waiting Lists']",8710026,"[['M01.060.057'], ['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.406'], ['C06.689.202', 'C08.381.187', 'C16.320.190', 'C16.614.213'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C08.381.423', 'C14.907.489.556'], ['C08.381'], ['E04.928.600.495', 'E04.936.450.495'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['Z01.542.651'], ['E05.581.500.653', 'N04.590.731'], ['C08.381.765'], ['E05.318.372.500.500.500', 'E05.318.372.500.750.750', 'N05.715.360.330.500.500.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.825', 'N06.850.520.450.500.500.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.825'], ['E05.318.308.985.550.900', 'N01.224.935.698.826', 'N06.850.505.400.975.550.900', 'N06.850.520.308.985.550.900'], ['M01.898'], ['N04.452.095.738']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Health Care [N]']",0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1
Activation energy determinations suggest that thiols reverse autooxidation of tetrahydrobiopterin by a different mechanism than ascorbate.,"In neutral aqueous solutions tetrahydrobiopterin is oxidized by dioxygen in a reaction that is succinctly described as autooxidation. Ascorbate and thiols moderate this reaction by reversing the oxidative process. In the present study the effect of various thiols on the apparent Arrhenius activation energy of tetrahydrobiopterin autooxidation was characterized and compared to that of ascorbate determined previously. We observed that - in sharp contrast to ascorbate - the efficiency of thiols to protect tetrahydrobiopterin decreased with the elevation of temperature from 22 to 37 degrees C. Accordingly, the apparent Arrhenius activation energies (in kJ/mol) measured in the presence of thiols were consistently greater than the value determined with tetrahydrobiopterin alone (59.6 +/- 1.4) or in the presence of ascorbate (59.9 +/- 2.8). Thus, the energy values were 88.8+/-1.1 with glutathione, 87.6 +/- 2.1 with N-acetylcysteine, 79.2 +/- 1.6 with cysteine, 75.1 +/- 2.4 with dithiotreitol and 70.3 +/- 0.9 with homocysteine. Since thiols are as potent reducing agents as ascorbate, these findings suggest that thiols and ascorbate protect tetrahydrobiopterin from oxidation acting at different steps of the oxidation process. It is likely that thiols reduce quinoidal dihydrobiopterin, whereas ascorbate scavenges the trihydrobiopterin radical to tetrahydrobiopterin. Furthermore, the results indicate that thiols are excellent tools to protect tetrahydrobiopterin from autooxidative decomposition in laboratory experiments conducted at relatively low temperatures, whereas the protective effect diminishes at 37 degrees C, i.e. under physiological conditions.","['Ascorbic Acid', 'Biopterin', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Sulfhydryl Compounds', 'Temperature']",16777471,"[['D02.241.081.844.107', 'D02.241.511.902.107', 'D09.811.100'], ['D03.633.100.733.631.202', 'D08.211.090'], ['G02.700', 'G03.295.531'], ['D02.886.489'], ['G01.906.595', 'G16.500.275.063.725.710', 'G16.500.750.775.710', 'N06.230.150.450', 'N06.230.300.100.725.710']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Health Care [N]']",0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
Isolation and preliminary characterization of amino acid substitution mutations that increase the activity of the osmoregulated ProP protein of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium.,"In Enterobacteriaceae, the ProP protein, which takes up proline and glycine betaine, is subject to a post-translational control mechanism that increases its activity at high osmolarity. In order to investigate the osmoregulatory mechanism of the Salmonella enterica ProP, we devised a positive selection for mutations that conferred increased activity on this protein at low osmolarity. The selection involved the isolation of mutations in a proline auxotroph that resulted in increased accumulation of proline via the ProP system in the presence of glycine betaine, which is a competitive inhibitor of proline uptake by this permease. This selection was performed by first-year undergraduates in two semesters of a research-based laboratory course. The students generated sixteen mutations resulting in six different single amino acids substitutions. They determined the effects of the mutations on the growth rates of the cells in media of high and low osmolarity in the presence of low concentrations of proline or glycine betaine. Furthermore, they identified the mutations by DNA sequencing and displayed the mutated amino acids on a putative three-dimensional structure of the protein. This analysis suggested that all six amino acid substitutions are residues in trans-membrane helices that have been proposed to contribute to the formation of the transport pore, and, thus, may affect the substrate binding site of the protein.","['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Amino Acid Substitution', 'Bacterial Proteins', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation, Missense', 'Phenotype', 'Proline', 'Protein Conformation', 'Protein Engineering', 'Salmonella typhimurium', 'Water-Electrolyte Balance']",22360681,"[['G02.111.570.060', 'L01.453.245.667.060'], ['E05.393.420.601.035', 'G05.558.109'], ['D12.776.097'], ['E05.599.595'], ['L01.453.245.667'], ['G05.365.590.650'], ['G05.695'], ['D12.125.072.401.623'], ['G02.111.570.820.709'], ['E05.393.420.601'], ['B03.440.450.425.800.200.825', 'B03.660.250.150.710.160.760'], ['G02.111.635.500', 'G03.615.500', 'G07.410.810.500']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]']",0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
Quality of life and eating disorders.,"OBJECTIVE: Eating disorders (EDs) can have a serious impact on various life domains and may lead to physical, mental and social impairment and consequently to poor quality of life (QOL). This study compared the QOL of ED patients and former ED patients in a large community based sample to the QOL of a normal reference group and to the QOL of patients with mood disorders. Differences between ED diagnostic groups were examined. The study investigated what factors contribute to QOL.METHODS: A generic health-related quality of life questionnaire, the Short Form-36 (SF-36), and the Eating Disorder Examination-Questionnaire were administered to 156 ED patients--44 anorexia nervosa patients, 43 bulimia nervosa patients, 69 eating disorder not otherwise specified patients--and 148 former ED patients.RESULTS: ED patients reported significantly poorer QOL than a normal reference group. No differences were found between the diagnostic groups. Former ED patients still had poorer QOL than a normal reference group. ED patients reported significantly poorer QOL than patients with mood disorders. Self esteem contributed most to QOL.CONCLUSION: EDs have a severe impact on many domains of QOL. Therefore QOL needs to be addressed in effectiveness research and clinical practice.","['Adult', 'Attitude to Health', 'Feeding and Eating Disorders', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Mood Disorders', 'Netherlands', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Quality of Life', 'Self Concept', 'Sickness Impact Profile', 'Stress, Psychological', 'Surveys and Questionnaires']",16110931,"[['M01.060.116'], ['F01.100.150', 'N05.300.150'], ['F03.400'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['F03.600'], ['Z01.542.651'], ['F01.145.677'], ['I01.800', 'K01.752.400.750', 'N06.850.505.400.425.837'], ['F01.752.747.792'], ['E05.318.308.980.438.475.730', 'N05.715.360.300.800.438.375.730', 'N06.850.520.308.980.438.475.730'], ['F01.145.126.990', 'F02.830.900'], ['E05.318.308.980', 'N05.715.360.300.800', 'N06.850.520.308.980']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Humanities [K]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1
Effect of dietary advice and n-3 supplementation in newly diagnosed MS patients.,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether supplementation with fish oil given together with dietary advice and vitamin supplementation influenced the clinical outcome in newly diagnosed multiple sclerosis (MS) patients.MATERIAL AND METHODS: Sixteen consecutive, newly diagnosed patients with multiple sclerosis were recruited to an open intervention study. They were given dietary advice and supplemented with 0.9 g/day of long-chain marine fatty acids and vitamins. The patients were followed for 2 years with respect to dietary habits, blood parameters and neurological assessment including exacerbation rate.RESULTS: There was a significant reduction in the mean annual exacerbation rate and the mean Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) as compared to pre-study values. The plasma total phospholipid n-3 fatty acids increased and n-6 fatty acids decreased significantly.CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that fish oil supplementation given together with vitamins and dietary advice can improve clinical outcome in patients with newly diagnosed MS.","['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Diet, Fat-Restricted', 'Fatty Acids, Omega-3', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Multiple Sclerosis, Relapsing-Remitting', 'Patient Education as Topic', 'Phospholipids', 'Prospective Studies', 'Secondary Prevention', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vitamins']",10987373,"[['C23.550.291.125'], ['M01.060.116'], ['E02.642.249.260', 'G07.203.650.240.260'], ['D10.212.302.380.410', 'D10.251.355.337', 'D10.627.430.450'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C10.114.375.500.600', 'C10.314.350.500.600', 'C20.111.258.250.500.600'], ['I02.233.332.500', 'N02.421.726.407.680'], ['D10.570.755'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.625', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.650', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.650'], ['E02.897', 'N02.421.726.825', 'N06.850.780.750'], ['E01.789.800', 'N04.761.559.590.800', 'N05.715.360.575.575.800'], ['D27.505.696.494.600', 'G07.203.300.681.500.600', 'J02.500.681.500.600']]","['Diseases [C]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0
Intraoperative electroencephalographic monitoring during carotid surgery with routine shunting.,"Fifty-nine patients undergoing sixty-four carotid reconstructions with routine intraluminal shunting had intraoperative electroencephalographic monitoring. The onset of rhythm or amplitude disturbances was demonstrated in 14 patients during exposure of the carotid artery, and in 24 patients during initial carotid clamping. Disturbances were seen in 15 patients during the period of intraluminal shunting and increased momentarily during the second clamping period. During closure of the surgical wound, all abnormalities disappeared except in one patient who ultimately developed a neurologic deficit upon awakening. Although patients who maintained normal electroencephalographic readings had higher carotid stump pressure (59 mm) than those who did not (42 mm), individual values were scattered. Intraoperative monitoring during carotid surgery with routine shunting has little usefulness.","['Aged', 'Anastomosis, Surgical', 'Blood Pressure', 'Brain Ischemia', 'Carotid Arteries', 'Carotid Artery Diseases', 'Electroencephalography', 'Endarterectomy', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Intraoperative Care', 'Intraoperative Complications', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Monitoring, Physiologic']",2364045,"[['M01.060.116.100'], ['E04.035'], ['E01.370.600.875.249', 'G09.330.380.076'], ['C10.228.140.300.150', 'C14.907.253.092'], ['A07.015.114.186'], ['C10.228.140.300.200', 'C14.907.253.123'], ['E01.370.376.300', 'E01.370.405.245'], ['E04.100.814.456'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E02.760.731.400', 'E04.604.249', 'N02.421.585.722.400'], ['C23.550.505'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['E01.370.520']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Health Care [N]']",1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
The PEDALS stationary cycling intervention and health-related quality of life in children with cerebral palsy: a randomized controlled trial.,"AIM: The aim of this study was to assess health-related quality of life (HRQOL) following a stationary cycling intervention in children with cerebral palsy (CP).METHOD: This was a phase I multisite randomized controlled trial with single blinding. HRQOL was evaluated using the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory SF15 (PedsQL; children) and Pediatric Outcomes Data Collection Instrument (PODCI; parent proxy) before and after a 3-month stationary cycling intervention. Sixty-two children (29 male, 33 female; mean age 11y; range 7-18y) with spastic diplegic CP, classified as levels I to III on the Gross Motor Function Classification System, were enrolled. Paired and independent t-tests were used to evaluate within- and between-group differences respectively.RESULTS: Between-group differences, favoring the cycling group, were found for PedsQL emotional functioning (p=0.046) and Parental PODCI treatment expectations scores (p=0.006). Between-group differences were not found for other scales. Within-group improvements were found in the cycling group: PedsQL total score (+5.8; p=0.006), psychosocial health summary (+6.9; p=0.008), and school functioning (+8.0; p=0.038). PODCI satisfaction with symptoms decreased significantly only in the control group (-12.0; p=0.046).INTERPRETATION: A beneficial influence of exercise on pediatric emotional well-being and parental treatment expectations was found. The evidence was not strong for other aspects of HRQOL. Results support the positive relationship between physical fitness and emotional well-being in the general population. A child's perception is important when examining change in his or her emotional well-being due to intervention.","['Adolescent', 'California', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Child', 'Comorbidity', 'Exercise Therapy', 'Female', 'Health Status', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Missouri', 'Motor Skills', 'Quality of Life', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Treatment Outcome']",22582760,"[['M01.060.057'], ['Z01.107.567.875.580.200', 'Z01.107.567.875.760.200'], ['C10.228.140.140.254'], ['M01.060.406'], ['N05.715.350.225', 'N06.850.490.687'], ['E02.760.169.063.500.387', 'E02.779.483', 'E02.831.535.483'], ['I01.240.425', 'N01.224.425', 'N06.850.505.400.425'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['Z01.107.567.875.510.515'], ['F02.808.260'], ['I01.800', 'K01.752.400.750', 'N06.850.505.400.425.837'], ['E05.318.308.980.438.475.456.500', 'N05.715.360.300.800.438.375.364.500', 'N06.850.520.308.980.438.475.364.500'], ['E01.789.800', 'N04.761.559.590.800', 'N05.715.360.575.575.800']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Humanities [K]']",0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1
Structure-activity correlations in human kidney aldehyde reductase-catalyzed reduction of para-substituted benzaldehyde by 3-acetyl pyridine adenine dinucleotide phosphate.,"Steady-state kinetic parameters of the human kidney aldehyde reductase-catalyzed reduction of para-substituted benzaldehydes by 3-acetyl pyridine dinucleotide phosphate (3-APADPH) were determined. The kcat of aldehyde reduction by 3-APADPH was 2- to 4-fold lower than by NADPH. The dissociation constant of 3-APADPH from the enzyme-coenzyme complex was higher (77 microM) than that of NADPH (5.3 microM). Primary deuterium kinetic isotope effects on both kcat and kcat/Km for para-substituted benzaldehyde reduction by 3-APADPH (with the exception of para-carboxybenzaldehyde) were equal and on average 2.82 +/- 0.21, suggesting that these reactions follow a rapid equilibrium-ordered reaction scheme in which the hydride transfer step is rate-limiting. Multiple regression analysis of the data suggests that benzaldehyde reduction depends upon electronic substituent effects, characterized by a rho value of 0.5. These data are consistent with a transition state in which the charge on the aldehyde carbonyl increases relative to the charge on this group in the ground state. A positive deviation of para-carboxybenzaldehyde from the linear correlation between other benzaldehydes and the substituent constant sigma + suggests a specific interaction of the carboxyl substituent of the substrate with the enzyme.","['Alcohol Dehydrogenase', 'Benzaldehydes', 'Catalysis', 'Humans', 'Kidney', 'Kinetics', 'NADP', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",2015291,"[['D08.811.682.047.820.250'], ['D02.047.222'], ['G02.130'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['A05.810.453'], ['G01.374.661', 'G02.111.490'], ['D03.633.100.759.646.138.749', 'D08.211.625', 'D13.695.667.138.749', 'D13.695.827.068.749'], ['G02.700', 'G03.295.531'], ['G02.111.830', 'G07.690.773.997']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Hyperdynamic resuscitation improves survival in patients with life-threatening burns.,"Our clinical experience has led to the conclusion, shared by others, that standard vital signs produce inadequate data for the resuscitation of severe burns. We reviewed three groups of burn patients including an index group (N = 53) whose resuscitation was guided by means of a pulmonary artery catheter, a control group (N = 33) collected from the burn registry for the period just before the index group, and a current group (N = 30) resuscitated with hyperdynamic end points defined empirically from surviving patients as guidelines. The mortality rate and organ failures decreased over time; the mortality rate of the control group was 48%, the index group 32%, and the protocol group 10% (p = 0.003). We concluded that hyperdynamic resuscitation does improve survival and reduces the incidence of organ failure.","['Adult', 'Burns', 'Cardiotonic Agents', 'Catheterization, Swan-Ganz', 'Colloids', 'Fluid Therapy', 'Hemodynamics', 'Humans', 'Resuscitation', 'Survival Rate']",9063781,"[['M01.060.116'], ['C26.200'], ['D27.505.954.411.222', 'D27.720.799.080'], ['E01.370.370.380.140.210', 'E02.148.224.165', 'E02.148.442.165', 'E04.100.814.529.937.165', 'E04.502.382.937.165', 'E05.157.250.165', 'E05.157.375.165'], ['D20.280', 'D26.255.165'], ['E02.319.360'], ['G09.330.380'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E02.365.647'], ['E05.318.308.985.550.900', 'N01.224.935.698.826', 'N06.850.505.400.975.550.900', 'N06.850.520.308.985.550.900']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Health Care [N]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
Immediate pars plana vitrectomy improves outcome in retained intravitreal lens fragments after phacoemulsification.,"PURPOSE: To investigate the clinical features, visual acuity outcomes and the most appropriate intervention time in patients with retained lens fragments managed by pars plana vitrectomy.METHODS: This was a retrospective review of the records of 78 patients who underwent pars plana vitrectomy for retained lens fragments at the Tri-Service General Hospital from January 1, 2000, to December 31, 2006.RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 70 years (range, 24-92 years). There were 40 men (51%) and 38 women (49%). The mean follow-up period after surgery was 13.8 months. Forty-five patients (58%) had vitrectomy within 1 day of phacoemulsification (group A), 22 (28%) within 1 week (group B) and 11 (14%) after more than 1 week (group C). No patients in group A developed complications, and 76% achieved a final visual acuity of 6/12 or better. In group B, all patients had elevated intraocular pressure, and 45% achieved a final visual acuity of 6/12 or better. In group C, all patients presented with corneal edema, moderate or severe uveitis, and elevated intraocular pressure. Of these patients, 27% had cystoid macular edema, 36% developed retinal detachment, and 27% had a final visual acuity of 6/12 or better.CONCLUSION: Pars plana vitrectomy performed immediately after cataract surgery for retained lens fragments is a viable option and may achieve a better visual outcome, with reduced risk of secondary glaucoma, retinal detachment or cystoid macular edema.","['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Lens Subluxation', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Phacoemulsification', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Visual Acuity', 'Vitrectomy']",18560248,"[['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['M01.060.116.100.080'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.249', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.350', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.350'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C11.510.598'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['E04.540.825.249.704', 'E04.943.875'], ['E05.318.372.500.500.500', 'E05.318.372.500.750.750', 'N05.715.360.330.500.500.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.825', 'N06.850.520.450.500.500.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.825'], ['E05.318.740.600.800.725', 'N05.715.350.200.700', 'N05.715.360.750.625.700.700', 'N06.850.490.625.750', 'N06.850.520.830.600.800.725'], ['G01.910.857'], ['E01.789.800', 'N04.761.559.590.800', 'N05.715.360.575.575.800'], ['E01.370.380.850.950', 'F02.463.593.932.901', 'G14.940'], ['E04.540.960']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]']",0,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
How to Map Theory: Reliable Methods Are Fruitless Without Rigorous Theory.,"Good science requires both reliable methods and rigorous theory. Theory allows us to build a unified structure of knowledge, to connect the dots of individual studies and reveal the bigger picture. Some have criticized the proliferation of pet ""Theories,"" but generic ""theory"" is essential to healthy science, because questions of theory are ultimately those of validity. Although reliable methods and rigorous theory are synergistic, Action Identification suggests psychological tension between them: The more we focus on methodological details, the less we notice the broader connections. Therefore, psychology needs to supplement training in methods (how to design studies and analyze data) with training in theory (how to connect studies and synthesize ideas). This article provides a technique for visually outlining theory: theory mapping. Theory mapping contains five elements, which are illustrated with moral judgment and with cars. Also included are 15 additional theory maps provided by experts in emotion, culture, priming, power, stress, ideology, morality, marketing, decision-making, and more (see all at theorymaps.org ).

However, we have reported a selective increase in renal inner medullary PDE5 that participates in the sodium retention of pregnancy. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine whether oral sildenafil treatment impairs maternal plasma volume expansion and/or fetal growth during rat pregnancy. Rats received sildenafil (10 mg x kg(-1) x day(-1), 50 mg x kg(-1) x day(-1), or 90 mg x kg(-1) x day(-1)) or vehicle on days 4-20 of pregnancy. On days 14-19, rats were housed in metabolic cages for collection of urine and measurement of food and water intake. Terminal hemodynamic and fetal measurements were taken on day 20. None of the sildenafil doses lowered blood pressure, and although all doses increased plasma cGMP concentrations, only the highest dose increased aortic and inner medullary cGMP content. Sildenafil had no effect on maternal weight gain; however, the highest dose decreased both plasma volume and renal sodium retention. The pup number and size were similar among the groups. Therefore, these studies suggest that low doses of systemic sildenafil may be safe during pregnancy in the rat, but higher doses may interfere with the physiological sodium retention and volume expansion of pregnancy. The effects of systemic sildenafil on blood pressure and sodium retention during hypertension in human pregnancy remain to be examined.","['Animals', 'Blood Pressure', 'Creatinine', 'Cyclic Nucleotide Phosphodiesterases, Type 5', 'Female', 'Fetal Development', 'Fetus', 'Hematocrit', 'Hemodynamics', 'Phosphodiesterase 5 Inhibitors', 'Phosphodiesterase Inhibitors', 'Piperazines', 'Plasma Volume', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy, Animal', 'Purines', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Regional Blood Flow', 'Sildenafil Citrate', 'Sodium', 'Sulfones', 'Vasodilator Agents']",19955496,"[['B01.050'], ['E01.370.600.875.249', 'G09.330.380.076'], ['D03.383.129.308.207'], ['D08.811.277.352.640.150.500', 'D08.811.277.352.640.155.500', 'D12.644.360.008.500', 'D12.644.360.009.500', 'D12.776.476.008.500', 'D12.776.476.009.500'], ['G07.345.500.325.235', 'G08.686.784.170.157'], ['A16.378'], ['E01.370.225.625.400', 'E05.200.625.400', 'G09.188.370.374'], ['G09.330.380'], ['D27.505.519.389.735.500'], ['D27.505.519.389.735'], ['D03.383.606'], ['G09.188.130.610', 'G09.330.380.092.610'], ['G08.686.784.769'], ['G08.686.784.769.498'], ['D03.633.100.759'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700.750'], ['G09.330.100.780'], ['D02.065.884.675', 'D02.886.590.700.675', 'D03.383.606.854', 'D03.633.100.759.824'], ['D01.268.549.750', 'D01.268.557.650', 'D01.552.528.850', 'D01.552.547.725'], ['D02.886.590'], ['D27.505.954.411.918']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
In vivo evaluation of [11C]- and [18F]-labelled cocaine analogues as potential dopamine transporter ligands for positron emission tomography.,"Four analogues of the potent dopamine transporter ligand, WIN 35,428, were radiolabelled with 11C and 18F at the 2-beta-carboxy position for evaluation as potential ligands for imaging dopamine uptake sites by positron emission tomography (PET) namely, methyl (1R-2-exo-3-exo)-8- methyl-3-(4-methylphenyl)-8-azabicyclo[3.2.1]octane-2-carboxylate (RTI-32), its 4-chlorophenyl analogue (RTI-31), 2'-fluoroethyl (1R-2-exo-3-exo)-8-methyl-3-(4-methylphenyl)-8-azabicyclo[3.2.1]octane-2 - carboxylate (FETT) and its 4-chlorophenyl analogue (FECT). Upon intravenous injection in rats, all four radiotracers displayed preferential accumulation of radioactivity in regions known to contain high concentrations of dopamine uptake sites. Competition studies with two of the analogues, [11C]RTI-32 and [18F]FETT, demonstrated that, for both radiotracers, binding was saturable and displayed the appropriate pharmacology as potential PET ligands for imaging the dopamine transporter.

ICTV Virus Taxonomy Profile: Partitiviridae.,"The Partitiviridae is a family of small, isometric, non-enveloped viruses with bisegmented double-stranded (ds) RNA genomes of 3-4.8 kbp. The two genome segments are individually encapsidated. The family has five genera, with characteristic hosts for members of each genus: either plants or fungi for genera Alphapartitivirus and Betapartitivirus, fungi for genus Gammapartitivirus, plants for genus Deltapartitivirus and protozoa for genus Cryspovirus. Partitiviruses are transmitted intracellularly via seeds (plants), oocysts (protozoa) or hyphal anastomosis, cell division and sporogenesis (fungi); there are no known natural vectors.

Cross-subtype antibody and cellular immune responses induced by a polyvalent DNA prime-protein boost HIV-1 vaccine in healthy human volunteers.,"An optimally effective AIDS vaccine would likely require the induction of both neutralizing antibody and cell-mediated immune responses, which has proven difficult to obtain in previous clinical trials. Here we report on the induction of Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type-1 (HIV-1)-specific immune responses in healthy adult volunteers that received the multi-gene, polyvalent, DNA prime-protein boost HIV-1 vaccine formulation, DP6-001, in a Phase I clinical trial conducted in healthy adult volunteers of both genders. Robust cross-subtype HIV-1-specific T cell responses were detected in IFNgamma ELISPOT assays. Furthermore, we detected high titer serum antibody responses that recognized a wide range of primary HIV-1 Env antigens and also neutralized pseudotyped viruses that express the primary Env antigens from multiple HIV-1 subtypes. These findings demonstrate that the DNA prime-protein boost approach is an effective immunization method to elicit both humoral and cell-mediated immune responses in humans, and that a polyvalent Env formulation could generate broad immune responses against HIV-1 viruses with diverse genetic backgrounds.","['AIDS Vaccines', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'HIV Antibodies', 'HIV Envelope Protein gp120', 'Human Experimentation', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin G', 'Interferon-gamma', 'Middle Aged', 'Neutralization Tests', 'T-Lymphocytes', 'Vaccines, DNA']",18243434,"[['D20.215.894.899.050'], ['M01.060.057'], ['M01.060.116'], ['D12.776.124.486.485.114.254.150.440', 'D12.776.124.790.651.114.254.150.440', 'D12.776.377.715.548.114.254.150.440'], ['D12.776.964.775.325.164.249', 'D12.776.964.775.562.500.500', 'D12.776.964.970.880.325.164.249', 'D23.050.327.520.350'], ['E05.445', 'H01.770.644.145.365'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D12.776.124.486.485.114.619.393', 'D12.776.124.790.651.114.619.393', 'D12.776.377.715.548.114.619.393'], ['D12.644.276.374.440.893', 'D12.644.276.374.480.615.350', 'D12.776.467.374.440.893', 'D12.776.467.374.480.615.350', 'D23.529.374.440.893', 'D23.529.374.480.615.350'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['E01.370.225.812.735.550', 'E05.200.812.735.550', 'E05.478.594.760.550'], ['A11.118.637.555.567.569', 'A15.145.229.637.555.567.569', 'A15.382.490.555.567.569'], ['D12.776.828.868.910', 'D20.215.894.865.910', 'D23.050.865.910']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0
A liquor contacting area in the pineal recess of the golden hamster (Mesocricetus auratus).,"The wall of the third ventricle in the pineal recess of the golden hamster (Mesocricetus auratus) has been investigated by light and electron microscopy. Deep in the pineal recess, where the ependymal lining is thin and non-ciliated, clusters of pinealocytes protrude into the ventricular lumen. They force the ependyma apart so that their surface is directly exposed to the CSF, while basal processes extend towards the hypependymal pineal tissue.

Incidence of microcracks in maxillary first premolars after instrumentation with three different mechanized file systems: a comparative ex vivo study.,"OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study is to determine the potential for microcracks in the radicular dentin of first maxillary premolars using three different mechanized endodontic instrumentation systems.METHODS: Eighty extracted maxillary first premolars with two root canals and no externally visible microcracks were selected. Root canal instrumentation was performed with either the ProTaper file system, the WaveOne primary file, or the self-adjusting file (SAF). Teeth with intact roots served as controls. The roots were cut into segments and examined with an intensive, small-diameter light source that was applied diagonally to the entire periphery of the root slice under ?20 magnification; the presence of microcracks and fractures was recorded. Pearson's chi-square method was used for statistical analysis, and significance was set at p < 0.05.RESULTS: Microcracks were present in 30 and 20 % of roots treated with the ProTaper and WaveOne systems, respectively, while no microcracks were present in the roots treated with the SAF (p = 0.008 and p = 0.035, respectively). Intact teeth presented with cracks in 5 % of the roots. The intensive, small-diameter light source revealed microcracks that could not be detected when using the microscope's light alone.CONCLUSIONS: Within the limitations of this study, it could be concluded that mechanized root canal instrumentation with the ProTaper and WaveOne systems in maxillary first premolars causes microcracks in the radicular dentin, while the use of the SAF file causes no such microcracks.CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Rotary and reciprocating files with large tapers may cause microcracks in the radicular dentin of maxillary first premolars. Less aggressive methods should be considered for these teeth.","['Bicuspid', 'Dental Instruments', 'Equipment Design', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Maxilla', 'Root Canal Preparation']",27025212,"[['A14.549.167.860.150'], ['E06.186.501', 'E07.222.501'], ['E05.320'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E05.481'], ['A02.835.232.781.324.502.645', 'A14.521.645'], ['E06.397.778.889', 'E06.931.625']]","['Anatomy [A]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]']",1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Characterisation of the water-isopropyl myristate system.,"Partition coefficients for compounds (solutes) from water to isopropyl myristate, IPM, have been obtained from the literature, either as directly determined partition coefficients or from solubilities in water and in IPM. The general solvation equation of Abraham has been applied to 141 such partition coefficients, as logPipm, and it is shown that the main solute factors that influence partition are dipolarity/polarisability, hydrogen bond acidity and hydrogen bond basicity that reduce partition, and volume that increases partition. These factors are quantitatively very similar to those that influence partition in the water to olive oil system, and indicate that IPM has the expected behaviour of a long chain, hydrophobic ester. It is shown that the water to IPM system is a poor model for partition between water and human stratum corneum and for permeation from water through human skin.","['Epidermis', 'Humans', 'Myristates', 'Water']",15814236,"[['A10.272.497', 'A17.815.250'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D10.251.640.610'], ['D01.045.250.875', 'D01.248.497.158.459.650', 'D01.650.550.925']]","['Anatomy [A]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]']",1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
The influence of the host cell on standardisation of influenza vaccine potency.,"Conventional influenza vaccines are standardised using the single-radial-immunodiffusion (SRD) test where reagents are produced from egg-grown viruses. It is important to ensure homology between SRD antigen reagents and test vaccines. There was concern that cell-grown vaccines may differ antigenically from corresponding egg-grown vaccines, which may in turn affect vaccine standardisation. In an examination of five cell-grown vaccines from two companies, only one vaccine was affected by the specificity of the SRD test. Options for standardisation of cell-grown vaccines are considered and recommendations are made for further studies.","['Animals', 'Antigens, Viral', 'Cell Line', 'Chick Embryo', 'Dogs', 'Humans', 'Immunodiffusion', 'Influenza A virus', 'Influenza Vaccines', 'Radioimmunoassay', 'Virus Cultivation']",10494972,"[['B01.050'], ['D23.050.327'], ['A11.251.210'], ['A13.350.150', 'A16.331.200'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.750.250.216.200'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E01.370.225.812.735.645.350', 'E05.200.812.735.645.350', 'E05.478.594.760.645.350', 'E05.478.605.492.350'], ['B04.820.480.968.405.400'], ['D20.215.894.899.302'], ['E01.370.384.700', 'E05.478.566.639', 'E05.601.470.639'], ['E01.370.225.875.970', 'E05.200.875.970']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The peptidoglycan type of strain JG 06(T) was variant A4ã. The menaquinone content was MK7 (100%). The polar lipid profile consisted of diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, monogalactosyl diglyceride, three unidentified phospholipids and three glycolipids. The predominant fatty acid was anteiso-C(15:0) (52.07%); significant amounts of iso-C(16:0)(12.38%), iso-C(15:0 )(8.59%) and anteiso-C(17:0)(10.03%) were also present. The G+C content of the DNA was 73.0 mol%. The strain formed a growth pellicle in nitrogen-free semisolid NFb medium containing NaCl at levels of up to 4% (w/v) and reduced acetylene to ethylene, a result indicative of N(2) fixation. In nutrient broth medium the novel strain grew at NaCl concentrations up to 15% (w/v). It also had the ability to produce indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) and siderophores, utilized 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC) as a sole source of nitrogen and possessed the ACC deaminase enzyme. On the basis of physiological, biochemical data and phylogenetic analyses, strain JG 06(T) should be placed in the genus Brachybacterium.

A study of sensory recovery following carpal tunnel release.,"The purpose of this study was to define the testing parameters that are most sensitive to sensory loss in carpal tunnel syndrome and then to track recovery of these sensations postoperatively. Two dozen patients underwent standard nerve decompression and were subsequently re-evaluated at six weeks, three months, and six months.

The most sensitive indicators of sensory abnormality were the ATT low-frequency vibration and skin indentation tests. Responses to all but these two tests returned to normal within two months postoperatively. The ATT indentation and vibration tests showed continual improvement over the study period, returning to nearly normal values by six months.

"The effects of recombinant human leptin on visceral fat, dyslipidemia, and insulin resistance in patients with human immunodeficiency virus-associated lipoatrophy and hypoleptinemia.","CONTEXT: Leptin deficiency is associated with dyslipidemia and insulin resistance in animals and humans with lipoatrophy; leptin replacement ameliorates these abnormalities.OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to evaluate the effects of leptin therapy in lipoatrophic HIV-infected patients with dyslipidemia and hypoleptinemia.DESIGN: This was a 6-month, open-label, proof-of-principle pilot study.SETTING: Metabolic ward studies were performed before and 3 and 6 months after leptin treatment.PARTICIPANTS: Participants included eight HIV-infected men with lipoatrophy, fasting triglycerides greater than 300 mg/dl, and serum leptin less than 3 ng/ml.INTERVENTION: Recombinant human leptin was given by sc injection (0.01 mg/kg and 0.03 mg/kg twice daily for successive 3 month periods).OUTCOME MEASURES: Measures included fat distribution by magnetic resonance imaging and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry; fasting lipids; insulin sensitivity by euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp; endogenous glucose production, gluconeogenesis, glycogenolysis, and whole-body lipolysis by stable isotope tracer studies; oral glucose tolerance testing; liver fat by proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy; and safety.RESULTS: Visceral fat decreased by 32% (P = 0.001) with no changes in peripheral fat. There were significant decreases in fasting total (15%, P = 0.012), direct low-density lipoprotein (20%, P = 0.002), and non-high-density lipoprotein (19%, P = 0.005) cholesterol. High-density lipoprotein cholesterol increased. Triglycerides, whole-body lipolysis, and free fatty acids decreased during fasting and hyperinsulinemia. Fasting insulin decreased. Endogenous glucose production decreased during fasting and hyperinsulinemia, providing evidence of improved hepatic insulin sensitivity. Leptin was well tolerated but decreased lean mass.CONCLUSIONS: Leptin treatment was associated with marked improvement in dyslipidemia. Hepatic insulin sensitivity improved and lipolysis decreased. Visceral fat decreased with no exacerbation of peripheral lipoatrophy. Results from this pilot study suggest that leptin warrants further study in patients with HIV-associated lipoatrophy.","['Adipose Tissue', 'Adult', 'Body Composition', 'Cholesterol', 'HIV Infections', 'Humans', 'Leptin', 'Lipodystrophy', 'Middle Aged', 'Oxygen Consumption', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Triglycerides', 'Viscera']",19174500,"[['A10.165.114'], ['M01.060.116'], ['G02.111.130', 'G03.180', 'G07.100.049'], ['D04.210.500.247.222.284', 'D04.210.500.247.808.197', 'D10.570.938.208'], ['C01.221.250.875', 'C01.221.812.640.400', 'C01.778.640.400', 'C01.925.782.815.616.400', 'C01.925.813.400', 'C20.673.480'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D06.472.699.042.500', 'D12.644.276.024.500', 'D12.644.548.011.500', 'D12.776.467.024.500', 'D23.529.024.500'], ['C17.800.849.391', 'C18.452.584.625', 'C18.452.880.391'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['G03.680'], ['D12.776.828'], ['D10.351.801'], ['A01.960']]","['Anatomy [A]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]']",1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
Success of medical therapy in a rare case of cecal ameboma.,"INTRODUCTION: Colitis caused by Entamoeba histolytica (EH) is prevalent in developing countries. Clinical presentation ranges from mild diarrhoea episodes to dysentery and liver abscess. Ameboma, a complication caused by EH invasion of the intestinal wall, is a rare presentation of amebiasis, occurring approximately in 1.5% of cases. Because of its insidious and variable clinical presentation only few cases are diagnosed previous to surgical intervention. We report a 52 years old Mexican-mestizo female, presenting with a pain-less right lower quadrant abdominal mass and diagnosed of cecal ameboma prior to surgery by colonoscopy and histopathologic examination. The present case highlights the importance of early diagnosis and medical therapy with antiparasitic drugs in order to avoid complications that could lead these patients to unnecessary surgical management.","['Amebiasis', 'Cecal Diseases', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Middle Aged', 'Remission Induction']",21592907,"[['C01.610.752.049'], ['C06.405.469.110'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['E02.860']]","['Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
Pre-operative localization of aldosterone-secreting adrenal adenomas.,"Techniques for pro-operative localization of aldosterone-secreting adrenal adenomas were studied in thirty-seven patients, each with hypertension and biochemical evidence of primary hyperaldosteronism and each later having adrenal surgery (thirty-two adenomas, five bilateral hyperplasia). Bilateral adrenal vein catheterization was attempted in all cases; it was successful on the left side in all patients and in 92% of cases on the right. Adrenal vein plasma samples were obtained from the left side in 92% and from the right in 73% of cases. Adrenal vein plasma aldosterone measurements correctly indicated the presence of tumour in twenty-eight cases but falsely predicted unilateral adenoma in two cases of bilateral adrenal hyperplasia. Adrenal venography also correctly predicted unilateral adrenal adenomas in twenty-six cases but falsely suggested the presence of tumour in three cases of bilateral adrenal hyperplasia. Computed tomography (CT) was used in the last eight cases. In seven instances the predictions (six adenomas, one bilateral adrenal hyperplasia) were confirmed at surgery. However, the remaining patient harboured an adenoma 20 mm in diameter which was not detected by CT although diagnosed both by adrenal venography and adrenal vein aldosterone measurements. Ultrasound detected adenoma in only three of twenty-two cases examined. Although further comparative studies of the type described here are required, the results of computed tomography are promising and suggest that this non-invasive technique might well become the first choice procedure in localizing aldosterone-secreting adenomas.","['Adenoma', 'Adrenal Gland Neoplasms', 'Adrenal Glands', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aldosterone', 'Catheterization', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hyperplasia', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed', 'Ultrasonography']",7326851,"[['C04.557.470.035'], ['C04.588.322.078', 'C19.053.347', 'C19.344.078'], ['A06.300.071'], ['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['D04.210.500.745.745.654.062', 'D06.472.040.585.353.118'], ['E02.148', 'E05.157'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C23.550.444'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['E01.370.350.350.810', 'E01.370.350.600.350.700.810', 'E01.370.350.700.700.810', 'E01.370.350.700.810.810', 'E01.370.350.825.810.810'], ['E01.370.350.850']]","['Diseases [C]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
Carbofuran-induced neurochemical and neurobehavioral alterations in rats: attenuation by N-acetylcysteine.,"Carbofuran, a widely used carbamate pesticide, has been reported to cause neurotoxicity. However, the underlying mechanisms involved in carbofuran neurotoxicity are not well understood. The present study was envisaged to investigate the possible role of oxidative stress in carbofuran neurotoxicity and to evaluate the protective effects of N-acetylcysteine (NAC). Acetylcholinesterase activity was significantly inhibited in all the regions of brain after carbofuran exposure (1 mg/kg body weight, orally, for 28 days). NAC, on the other hand, was found to partially restore the activity of acetylcholinesterase in carbofuran treated animals. Carbofuran exposure resulted in increased lipid peroxidation (LPO) in brain regions accompanied by decreased levels of glutathione. NAC administration to the carbofuran exposed animals lowered LPO along with partial repletion in glutathione levels. Concomitantly, the activities of superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase and glutathione reductase were significantly decreased after carbofuran exposure, while no significant change in the activity of glutathione-S-transferase was observed. NAC treatment to carbofuran treated rats resulted in protective effect on the activities of these enzymes. Marked impairment in the motor function was seen following carbofuran exposure, which is evident by significant decrease in the retention time of the rats on rotating rods. Cognitive deficits were also seen after carbofuran exposure as indicated by the significant decrease in active avoidance response. NAC treatment significantly improved the carbofuran-induced neurobehavioral deficits. The results clearly demonstrate that carbofuran exerts its neurotoxic effects by accentuating oxidative stress and suggest neuroprotective role of NAC in carbofuran neurotoxicity.","['Acetylcholinesterase', 'Acetylcysteine', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Animals', 'Avoidance Learning', 'Behavior, Animal', 'Brain', 'Brain Chemistry', 'Carbofuran', 'Cholinesterase Inhibitors', 'Drug Interactions', 'Free Radical Scavengers', 'Glutathione', 'Lipid Peroxidation', 'Male', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar', 'Rotarod Performance Test']",16307259,"[['D08.811.277.352.100.170.176'], ['D02.886.030.230.259', 'D12.125.166.230.259'], ['E05.318.740.150', 'N05.715.360.750.125', 'N06.850.520.830.150'], ['B01.050'], ['F02.463.425.097', 'F02.463.785.373.173'], ['F01.145.113'], ['A08.186.211'], ['G02.111.150', 'G03.185'], ['D02.241.081.251.583.166'], ['D27.505.519.389.275', 'D27.505.519.625.120.300', 'D27.505.696.577.120.300'], ['G07.690.773.968'], ['D27.505.519.217.500'], ['D12.644.456.448'], ['G02.111.515', 'G03.295.531.587'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700.900'], ['E05.017.449']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

Electrochemical screening of anti-microbial peptide LL-37 interaction with phospholipids.,"LL-37 is an alpha-helical antimicrobial peptide of human origin. It is a 37 residue cathelicidin peptide. This paper explores the use of electrochemical methods to investigate the interaction of LL-37 with phospholipid and lipid A monolayers on a mercury drop electrode. Experiments were carried out in Dulbecco's phosphate buffered saline at pH approximately 7.6. The capacity-potential curves of the coated electrode in the presence and absence of LL-37 were measured using out-of-phase ac voltammetry. The frequency dependence of the complex impedance of the coated electrode in the presence and absence of LL-37 was estimated at -0.4 V versus Ag/AgCl 3.5 mol dm(-3) KCl. The monolayer permeability to ions was studied by following the reduction of Tl(I) to Tl(Hg) at the coated electrode. LL-37 shows no significant interaction with DOPC. However, LL-37 shows a small interaction with DOPG and lipid A within a DOPC monolayer where the monolayer permeability is marginally increased and the zero frequency capacitance (ZFC) is marginally decreased in both cases. LL-37 shows a significant interaction with a lipid A monolayer thereby decreasing the ZFC by 30%. The results concur with the known membrane active properties of LL-37 and establish this electrochemical approach as a key technique for screening peptides.","['Antimicrobial Cationic Peptides', 'Electric Impedance', 'Electrochemistry', 'Lipid Bilayers', 'Materials Testing', 'Phospholipids', 'Porosity', 'Spectrum Analysis']",16949887,"[['D12.644.050', 'D12.776.543.695.054'], ['G01.358.500.249.277.350'], ['H01.181.529.307'], ['D10.570.510', 'J01.637.087.500.510'], ['E05.570'], ['D10.570.755'], ['G01.374.710'], ['E05.196.867']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0
Reconstitution of carotenoids into the light-harvesting complex B800-850 of Chromatium minutissimum.,"Chromatophores and peripheral light-harvesting complexes B800-850 with a trace of carotenoids were isolated from Chromatium minutissimum cells in which carotenoid biosynthesis was inhibited by diphenylamine. Three methods previously used for the reconstitution of carotenoids into either the light-harvesting (LH1) type complexes or reaction centers (RC) of carotenoidless mutants were examined for the possibility of carotenoid reconstitution into the carotenoid depleted chromatophores. All these methods were found to be unsuitable because carotenoid depleted complex B800-850 from Chr. minutissimum is characterized by high lability. We have developed a novel method maintaining the native structure of the complexes and allowing reconstitution of up to 80% of the carotenoids as compared to the control. The reconstituted complex has a similar CD spectrum in the carotenoid region as the control, and its structure restores its stability. These data give direct proof for the structural role of carotenoids in bacterial photosynthesis.","['Bacterial Proteins', 'Carotenoids', 'Chromatium', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Diphenylamine', 'Mutation', 'Photosynthetic Reaction Center Complex Proteins']",12948391,"[['D12.776.097'], ['D02.455.326.271.665.202', 'D02.455.426.392.368.367.379.249', 'D02.455.849.131', 'D23.767.261'], ['B03.440.425.410.290', 'B03.660.250.110.150'], ['E05.196.181.400.300'], ['D02.092.146.350'], ['G05.365.590'], ['D05.500.562.488', 'D08.811.600.710', 'D12.776.543.930.500', 'D12.776.765.199.750.750']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Genomic and transcriptome analysis of triclosan response of a multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii strain, MDR-ZJ06.","During the last decade, an increasing amount of attention has focused on the potential threat of triclosan to both the human body and environmental ecology. However, the role of triclosan in the development of drug resistance and cross resistance is still in dispute ascribed to largely unknown of triclosan resistance mechanism. In this work, Acinetobacter baumannii MDR-ZJ06, a multidrug-resistant strain, was induced by triclosan, and the genomic variation and transcriptional levels were investigated, respectively. The comparative transcriptomic analysis found that several general protective mechanisms were enhanced under the triclosan condition, including responses to reactive oxygen species and cell membrane damage. Meanwhile, all of the detected fifteen single nucleotide polymorphisms were not directly associated triclosan tolerance. In summary, this work revealed the crucial role of the general stress response in A. baumannii under a triclosan stress condition, which informs a more comprehensive understanding of the role of triclosan in the spread of drug-resistant bacteria.","['Acinetobacter baumannii', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple, Bacterial', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genome, Bacterial', 'Genomics', 'Triclosan']",27665456,"[['B03.440.400.425.537.050.099', 'B03.660.250.530.050.099'], ['D27.505.954.122.085'], ['G06.099.225.812', 'G06.225.347.812', 'G07.690.773.984.269.347.812', 'G07.690.773.984.300.500'], ['E05.393.332'], ['G05.360.340.358.207'], ['H01.158.273.180.350', 'H01.158.273.343.350'], ['D02.355.726.900', 'D02.455.426.559.389.657.654.900']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]']",0,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
Xanthine derivatives: comparison between suppression of tumour necrosis factor-alpha production and inhibition of cAMP phosphodiesterase activity.,"Several in vitro and in vivo studies have demonstrated suppression of tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) synthesis by pentoxifylline. In the present study we compared the effect of pentoxifylline with that of five other xanthine derivatives. We addressed two questions. First, what is the relative potency of those chemically related compounds in suppressing the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced production of TNF-alpha in human mononuclear cells? Second, does suppression of TNF-alpha production by these xanthine derivatives correlate with their capacity to inhibit 3',5'-cAMP phosphodiesterase (PDE) activity? The experimental drug A 80 2715 [1-(5-hydroxy-5-methylhexyl)-3-methyl-7-propylxanthine] was identified as the most potent agent with an IC50 (concentration exerting 50% suppression of LPS-induced TNF-alpha production) of 41 microM (mean of 13 individuals). The IC50 values of the other substances ranged between 106 microM for HWA 138 and 419 microM for theophylline. The LPS-induced interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) production was not influenced by all substances tested at comparable concentrations. Inhibition of PDE activity was determined in a cell-free system using PDE isolated from bovine heart. All xanthine derivatives dose-dependently inhibited PDE activity. Furthermore, with the exception of theophylline, there was a high degree of correlation between the potency to suppress TNF-alpha production in the cell culture system and the potency to inhibit PDE activity in the cell-free enzymatic assay. This argues for a crucial role of PDE inhibition in the suppression of TNF-alpha synthesis by xanthine derivatives.","[""3',5'-Cyclic-AMP Phosphodiesterases"", 'Cells, Cultured', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Humans', 'Pentoxifylline', 'Theophylline', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha', 'Xanthines']",8388363,"[['D08.811.277.352.640.150', 'D12.644.360.008', 'D12.776.476.008'], ['A11.251'], ['G07.690.773.875', 'G07.690.936.500'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D03.633.100.759.758.824.651.700'], ['D03.132.960.751', 'D03.633.100.759.758.824.751'], ['D12.644.276.374.500.800', 'D12.644.276.374.750.626', 'D12.776.124.900', 'D12.776.395.930', 'D12.776.467.374.500.800', 'D12.776.467.374.750.626', 'D23.529.374.500.800', 'D23.529.374.750.626'], ['D03.132.960', 'D03.633.100.759.758.824']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]']",1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
A voltage-clamp study of calcium currents in neurons freshly isolated from the dorsal root ganglion of adult rats.,"Calcium currents were studied in a preparation of freshly isolated neurons of the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) of adult rats using the whole-cell voltage-clamp technique in conditions of minimal current flow through sodium and potassium channels. A low-threshold (LT) and a high-threshold (HT) current were distinguished on the basis of a different potential of activation. Both currents also showed differences in their peak amplitude, their distribution among the cells, their kinetics, their steady-state inactivation curve and their sensitivity to cadmium. Comparison of the properties of both currents with the known properties of calcium currents in DRG neurons from immature animals indicates a slower rate of inactivation of the LT-current in the adult DRG neuron. The calcium entry blocker flunarizine (10 microM) caused a negative shift of the steady-state inactivation curve of the inactivating component of HT-current, an effect which suggests voltage-dependent inhibition.","['Animals', 'Cadmium', 'Calcium Channels', 'Electric Conductivity', 'Flunarizine', 'Ganglia, Spinal', 'Kinetics', 'Neurons', 'Nifedipine', 'Potassium Channels', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar', 'Sodium Channels']",7508292,"[['B01.050'], ['D01.268.556.137', 'D01.268.956.061', 'D01.552.544.137'], ['D12.776.157.530.400.150', 'D12.776.543.550.450.150', 'D12.776.543.585.400.150'], ['G01.358.500.249.277'], ['D03.383.606.450'], ['A08.340.390.340', 'A08.800.350.340', 'A08.800.800.720.725.350'], ['G01.374.661', 'G02.111.490'], ['A08.675', 'A11.671'], ['D03.383.725.203.540'], ['D12.776.157.530.400.600', 'D12.776.543.550.450.750', 'D12.776.543.585.400.750'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700.900'], ['D12.776.157.530.400.875', 'D12.776.543.550.450.875', 'D12.776.543.585.400.875']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Nanotube surfactant design: the versatility of water-soluble perylene bisimides.,"The synthesis of perylene-based single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) surfactants and the dispersion and exfoliation of SWCNTs in water by a variety of designed surfactants is investigated. The quality of the nanotube dispersions is evaluated by optical absorption and emission spectroscopy, zeta-potential measurements and statistical atomic force microscopy (AFM). Significantly the dispersion efficiency can be increased at higher pH, as water solubility of the surfactants is ensured by peripheral derivatization with carboxyl-functionalized first- and second-order Newkome dendrimers. Even at very low perylene concentrations of 0.1 g L(-1) and a nanotube-to-surfactant ratio of 1:1, the nanotube supernatant after centrifugation contains up to 73% of the pristine material with exfoliation degrees (the number of fractions of individualized nanotubes N(I)/N(T)) of up to 76%. The adsorption of the perylene core to the nanotube scaffold is indicated by red-shifted perylene-absorption and SWCNT-emission features except for the smallest perylene amphiphile, where solubilization is presumably based on a micellar arrangement. The nanotube fluorescence is significantly altered and reduced in intensity compared to nanotubes dispersed in sodium dodecylbenzene sulfonate (SDBS) being strongly dependent on the structure of the perylene surfactant. We attribute this observation to the homogeneity of the surfactant coverage, e.g., the supramolecular arrangement onto the nanotube backbone. This study represents a step forward in understanding the structure-property relationship of nanotube surfactants. Furthermore high-quality nanotube dispersions with increased degrees of exfoliation are highly desirable, as the efficiency of nanotube separation techniques relies on highly individualized samples.","['Imides', 'Microscopy, Atomic Force', 'Nanotubes, Carbon', 'Perylene', 'Spectrophotometry, Ultraviolet', 'Spectroscopy, Near-Infrared', 'Surface-Active Agents', 'Water']",20217789,"[['D02.478'], ['E01.370.350.515.666.400', 'E05.595.666.400'], ['D01.268.150.250.500', 'J01.637.512.850.500'], ['D02.455.426.559.847.149.700', 'D02.455.426.559.847.680.500', 'D04.615.149.700', 'D04.615.680.500'], ['E05.196.712.726.802', 'E05.196.867.826.802'], ['E01.370.350.750', 'E05.196.867.851'], ['D27.720.877'], ['D01.045.250.875', 'D01.248.497.158.459.650', 'D01.650.550.925']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]']",0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
The effects of different phosphoric acid concentrations on surface enamel.,"The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of different acid concentrations on the enamel surface morphology. The buccal surfaces of 25 extracted premolars from young patients were etched with 40%, 20%, 10%, 5%, and 2% phosphoric acid solutions for 60 seconds. The specimens were examined with a scanning electron microscope in the occlusal, central, and cervical regions. A great variation of the etching patterns was observed in almost all test groups. The extent of the appearance of prism outlines was smaller in the cervical region and at lower acid concentrations. The advantages and disadvantages of the use of lower concentrated acids are discussed.","['Acid Etching, Dental', 'Adolescent', 'Child', 'Dental Enamel', 'Dental Enamel Solubility', 'Humans', 'Microscopy, Electron, Scanning', 'Phosphoric Acids', 'Time Factors']",1554164,"[['E06.931.475.111'], ['M01.060.057'], ['M01.060.406'], ['A14.549.167.900.255'], ['G10.549.181'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E01.370.350.515.402.541', 'E05.595.402.541'], ['D01.029.260.700.675', 'D01.695.625.675'], ['G01.910.857']]","['Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
Conceptual views on quality of life.,"Quality of life can be discussed in many ways. One way is to analyse the empirical quantitative approach to determine whether the research categories are operational, empirically unambiguous, and thematically relevant; progress, in the sense of changing the number of research categories, does not take place through a systematic empirical test but through a modification of the theory of quality of life. The current debate on quality of life has included a conflict between natural science and a humanistic approach. Our view is that quality of life must be defined through the difficult concept of happiness. When cancer threatens happiness, not one but two fundamental crises influence quality of life, which we regard as a key concept of a therapeutic method.","['Adaptation, Psychological', 'Choice Behavior', 'Humanism', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms', 'Quality of Life', 'Research Design', 'Science']",1514971,"[['F01.058'], ['F02.463.785.373.346'], ['K01.752.566.479.174', 'N05.350.835'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C04'], ['I01.800', 'K01.752.400.750', 'N06.850.505.400.425.837'], ['E05.581.500', 'H01.770.644.728'], ['H01.770']]","['Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Humanities [K]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]']",0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0
Current use of preoperative intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation in high-risk cardiac surgery: a cohort study.,"OBJECTIVE: To determine whether preoperative introduction of intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation (IABC) reduced mortality in high-risk patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery.METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study of prospectively collected data on all patients who underwent cardiac surgery at a university hospital in Sydney, New South Wales, between 1 January 2002 and 20 August 2007. High risk was defined as the presence of two or more recognised risk factors. We compared the observed mortality to the mortality predicted by the EuroSCORE, and conducted a logistic regression analysis to determine the effect of preoperative IABC on mortality.RESULTS: Among 358 patients deemed high risk, 36 underwent preoperative IABC. This group had higher EuroSCORE-predicted mortality than the group that did not undergo IABC (38% v 18%, P = 0.008). Despite this, observed mortality was similar for those with and without preoperative IABC (both 2.8%) and was significantly lower than predicted in both groups. This equates to a riskadjusted reduction in mortality associated with the use of preoperative IABC (hazard ratio, 0.47; 95%CI, 0.26-0.84; P = 0.005). This result was not confirmed in the logistic regression analysis, with an adjusted odds ratio for mortality of 0.85 (95% CI, 0.09-7.6; P = 0.88). Rates of postoperative complications, including limb ischaemia, were low and similar in both groups.CONCLUSIONS: In this study of high-risk CABG patients, the use of preoperative IABC in the group with higher predicted mortality was associated with a relative reduction in observed mortality. These data provide cautious support for the use of preoperative IABC in selected high-risk patients.","['Aged', 'Coronary Artery Bypass', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Intra-Aortic Balloon Pumping', 'Length of Stay', 'Male', 'New South Wales', 'Postoperative Complications', 'Preoperative Care', 'Regression Analysis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors']",18798716,"[['M01.060.116.100'], ['E04.100.376.719.332', 'E04.100.814.868.750', 'E04.928.220.520.220'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E04.050.215.400'], ['E02.760.400.480', 'N02.421.585.400.480'], ['Z01.639.100.750', 'Z01.678.100.373.750'], ['C23.550.767'], ['E02.760.795', 'E04.604.750', 'N02.421.585.795'], ['E05.318.740.750', 'N05.715.360.750.695', 'N06.850.520.830.750'], ['E05.318.372.500.500.500', 'E05.318.372.500.750.750', 'N05.715.360.330.500.500.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.825', 'N06.850.520.450.500.500.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.825'], ['E05.318.740.600.800.725', 'N05.715.350.200.700', 'N05.715.360.750.625.700.700', 'N06.850.490.625.750', 'N06.850.520.830.600.800.725']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Diseases [C]']",0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1
Personality dysfunction in adults who stutter: another look.,"PURPOSE: Given reports of the frequent occurrence of personality disorders (PD) among individuals who stutter, this investigation was designed to determine the presence of personality disorders (PD) for individuals seeking treatment for stuttering, using a different self-report measure.METHOD: The sample included 50 adults who were undergoing treatment for stuttering. The participants also completed a self-report measure (Assessment of the DSM-IV Personality Disorders, ADP-IV) that is known to have good differential validity in the assessment of personality disorders as well as good convergent validity with a structured interview administered by a skilled mental health professional.RESULTS: Four participants met threshold values for one personality disorder (PD) and one participant met criteria for two personality disorders. The remaining 45 participants (90%) did not meet criteria for a PD.CONCLUSION: Rates of observed PDs in this sample approximated rates that have been observed in general community samples using structured clinical interviews and trained interviewers. Related reports which have claimed high levels of personality disorders among adults who stutter appear to be inflated by the use of self-report devices that overestimate the occurrence and co-morbidity of these conditions. Implications for the treatment of adults who stutter are discussed.EDUCATIONAL OBJECTIVES: The reader will be able to (a) summarize two basic perspectives of how individuals who stutter are influenced by the possibility of personality dysfunction (b) describe the factors that influence the detection of personality dysfunction using self-report procedures, discuss the important (c) theoretical and (d) clinical implications of accurately identifying personality dysfunction for adults who stutter.","['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Comorbidity', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Personality', 'Personality Disorders', 'Personality Inventory', 'Self Report', 'Stuttering', 'Young Adult']",23773670,"[['M01.060.057'], ['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['N05.715.350.225', 'N06.850.490.687'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['F01.752'], ['F03.675'], ['F04.711.647.513'], ['E05.318.308.980.500', 'N05.715.360.300.800.500', 'N06.850.520.308.980.500'], ['C10.597.606.150.500.800.750', 'C23.888.592.604.150.500.800.750'], ['M01.060.116.815']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Diseases [C]']",0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
Transcriptional Response of Multiple ESBL Genes Within Escherichia coli Under Oxyimino-Cephalosporin Stress.,"The expression of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases directly interferes with the treatment options in a clinical setting. It is not clearly defined why bacteria acquire multiple beta-lactamases and how they are being expressed in antibiotic stress. With this key question, the study was designed to understand the transcriptional response in Escherichia coli harboring multiple blaESBLs against different oxyimino-cephalosporin stress. A total of 169 consecutive, nonduplicate oxyimino-cephalosporin-resistant isolates of E. coli were screened and were ESBL positive. Among them six isolates were found to harbor multiple beta-lactamase genes and we, as per our objective, selected them for this study. Molecular characterization was done by multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay. Minimum inhibitory concentration, transcriptional expression, transferability, and plasmid incompatibility typing of multiple blaESBLs were carried out. Plasmid stability and antibiotic susceptibility of donor and transconjugants were performed. A total of six isolates were found to be harboring multiple ESBL genes and MIC above the breakpoint level against all the tested antibiotics. Quantitative real-time PCR showed that in basal level without antibiotic stress, SHV-148 expressed more, but with ceftriaxone stressed, expression of CTX-M-15 and SHV-148 was high. In case of PER-1, expression was high with ceftazidime stress. blaESBLs were horizontally transferable and originated through multiple inc types. Plasmids were stable till 115 serial passages. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis results showed that multiple ESBL genes were spread through six pulsotypes. Our study concludes that acquisition of multiple ESBL genes in E. coli was a specific adaptation for survival against multiple oxyimino-cephalosporin stress in this clinical setting.","['Adult', 'Aged', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Ceftazidime', 'Cephalosporins', 'Escherichia coli', 'Escherichia coli Infections', 'Escherichia coli Proteins', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Microbial Sensitivity Tests', 'Middle Aged', 'Plasmids', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'beta-Lactamases']",27214038,"[['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['D27.505.954.122.085'], ['D02.065.589.099.249.210.150', 'D02.886.665.074.210.150', 'D03.633.100.300.249.210.150'], ['D02.065.589.099.249', 'D02.886.665.074', 'D03.633.100.300.249'], ['B03.440.450.425.325.300', 'B03.660.250.150.180.100'], ['C01.150.252.400.310.330'], ['D12.776.097.275'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E01.370.225.875.595', 'E05.200.875.595', 'E05.337.550.400'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['G05.360.600'], ['E05.393.620.500.706'], ['G02.111.873', 'G05.297.700'], ['D08.811.277.087.180']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
Influence of repeated sprint training on pulmonary O2 uptake and muscle deoxygenation kinetics in humans.,"We hypothesized that a short-term training program involving repeated all-out sprint training (RST) would be more effective than work-matched, low-intensity endurance training (ET) in enhancing the kinetics of oxygen uptake (Vo(2)) and muscle deoxygenation {deoxyhemoglobin concentration ([HHb])} following the onset of exercise. Twenty-four recreationally active subjects (15 men, mean +/- SD: age 21 +/- 4 yr, height 173 +/- 9 cm, body mass 71 +/- 11 kg) were allocated to one of three groups: RST, which completed six sessions of four to seven 30-s RSTs; ET, which completed six sessions of work-matched, moderate-intensity cycling; and a control group (CON). All subjects completed moderate-intensity and severe-intensity ""step"" exercise transitions before (Pre) and after the 2-wk intervention period (Post). Following RST, [HHb] kinetics were speeded, and the amplitude of the [HHb] response was increased during both moderate and severe exercise (P < 0.05); the phase II Vo(2) kinetics were accelerated for both moderate (Pre: 28 +/- 8, Post: 21 +/- 8 s; P < 0.01) and severe (Pre: 29 +/- 5, Post: 23 +/- 5 s; P < 0.05) exercise; the amplitude of the Vo(2) slow component was reduced (Pre: 0.52 +/- 0.19, Post: 0.40 +/- 0.17 l/min; P < 0.01); and exercise tolerance during severe exercise was improved by 53% (Pre: 700 +/- 234, Post: 1,074 +/- 431 s; P < 0.01). None of these parameters was significantly altered in the ET and CON groups. Six sessions of RST, but not ET, resulted in changes in [HHb] kinetics consistent with enhanced fractional muscle O(2) extraction, faster Vo(2) kinetics, and an increased tolerance to high-intensity exercise.","['Adaptation, Physiological', 'Bicycling', 'Exercise', 'Exercise Test', 'Female', 'Hemoglobins', 'Humans', 'Lung', 'Male', 'Muscle, Skeletal', 'Oxygen', 'Oxygen Consumption', 'Spectroscopy, Near-Infrared', 'Young Adult']",19342439,"[['G07.025', 'G16.012.500'], ['I03.450.642.845.140'], ['G11.427.410.698.277', 'I03.350'], ['E01.370.370.380.250', 'E01.370.386.700.250', 'E05.333.250'], ['D12.776.124.400', 'D12.776.422.316.762'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['A04.411'], ['A02.633.567', 'A10.690.552.500'], ['D01.268.185.550', 'D01.362.670'], ['G03.680'], ['E01.370.350.750', 'E05.196.867.851'], ['M01.060.116.815']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Named Groups [M]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
Prophylactic oophorectomy in the treatment of carcinoma of the breast.,"Several prospective clinical trials have been conducted to investigate the efficacy of prophylactic ovarium ablation in the primary treatment of carcinoma of the breast. The results have varied and the follow-up periods have been rather short. A prospective randomized study was done at our institution from 1961 to 1966 to test the value of prophylactic oophorectomy in the treatment of carcinoma of the breast. The patients have now been studied for 17 to 22 years. Patients were randomized into two groups: a control group and a group treated by surgical castration. By December 1983 280 patients were evaluable, 154 in the control group and 126 in the oophorectomy group. One hundred and forty-nine patients died during the observation time. All but 11 patients underwent autopsy. There are no significant differences between the group regarding age, axillary node involvement, menstrual status, perinodal tumor growth and distribution in the different TNM stages. The results of the study did not demonstrate any significant differences in cure rate, survival time, recurrence free intervals or intervals between recurrence of the disease and death. The results were independent of nodal status, TNM classification and menstrual status of the patient. These findings do not support the use of prophylactic oophorectomy in the treatment of operable carcinoma of the breast in TNM Stages I and II, whereas no conclusion can be drawn regarding TNM Stage III as the number of patients in this stage is small.","['Adult', 'Aged', 'Breast Neoplasms', 'Carcinoma', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Lymph Node Excision', 'Mastectomy', 'Menopause', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Ovariectomy', 'Prospective Studies', 'Random Allocation']",3513347,"[['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['C04.588.180', 'C17.800.090.500'], ['C04.557.470.200'], ['E05.318.372.250.250', 'N05.715.360.330.250.250', 'N06.850.520.450.250.250'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.249', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.350', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.350'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E04.446'], ['E04.466'], ['G08.686.157.500', 'G08.686.841.249.500'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['C04.697.655', 'C23.550.727.655'], ['E01.789.625'], ['E04.270.282.685', 'E04.950.165.685', 'E04.950.300.680'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.625', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.650', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.650'], ['E05.318.370.700', 'E05.581.500.805', 'N05.715.360.325.675', 'N06.850.520.445.700']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0

Ministers' perceptions of church-based programs to provide depression care for African Americans.,"African Americans, compared with white Americans, underutilize mental health services for major depressive disorder. Church-based programs are effective in reducing racial disparities in health; however, the literature on church-based programs for depression is limited. The purpose of this study was to explore ministers' perceptions about depression and the feasibility of utilizing the church to implement evidence-based assessments and psychotherapy for depression. From August 2011 to March 2012, data were collected from three focus groups conducted with adult ministers (n = 21) from a black mega-church in New York City. Using consensual qualitative research to analyze data, eight main domains emerged: definition of depression, identification of depression, causal factors, perceived responsibilities, limitations, assessment, group interpersonal psychotherapy, and stigma. A major finding was that ministers described depression within a context of vast suffering due to socioeconomic inequalities (e.g., financial strain and unstable housing) in many African American communities. Implementing evidence-based assessments and psychotherapy in a church was deemed feasible if principles of community-based participatory research were utilized and safeguards to protect participants' confidentiality were employed. In conclusion, ministers were enthusiastic about the possibility of implementing church-based programs for depression care and emphasized partnering with academic researchers throughout the implementation process. More research is needed to identify effective, multidisciplinary interventions that address social inequalities which contribute to racial disparities in depression treatment.","['African Americans', 'Depressive Disorder, Major', 'Female', 'Focus Groups', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mental Health Services', 'Middle Aged', 'New York City', 'Professional Role', 'Protestantism', 'Psychotherapy', 'Religion and Psychology']",23471573,"[['M01.686.508.100.100', 'M01.686.754.100'], ['F03.600.300.375'], ['E05.318.308.112', 'N05.715.360.300.269', 'N06.850.520.308.112'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['F04.408', 'N02.421.461'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['Z01.107.567.875.350.530.530', 'Z01.107.567.875.500.530.530', 'Z01.433.741'], ['F01.829.316.616.625'], ['K01.844.188.644'], ['F04.754'], ['F02.880', 'K01.844.664']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Humanities [K]']",0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1
"The randomized fast-track trial in palliative care: role, utility and ethics in the evaluation of interventions in palliative care?","BACKGROUND: Randomized trials are the gold standard method for evaluating treatments and services in health care. However, they are often difficult to complete in palliative care, and suffer from poor recruitment.AIM: To introduce the randomized fast-track trial and its potential use in palliative care.METHOD: The randomized fast-track trial is a form of randomized trial with two periods. In the first, the trial runs as a normal randomized trial. In the second period, the standard (control) group also are offered the intervention. The design is adapted from a 'wait list' design (sometimes called a deferred entry or delayed intervention trial) but is both less confusing for patients, who are not on waiting lists, and more appropriate to the nature of services offered. The methodology has the advantage of being more acceptable to many patients, clinicians and ethics committees than standard randomized trials, because all patients will eventually be offered the intervention. Yet it has the rigour of a traditional randomized trial. However, care is needed to ensure the correct timing for the first period, before the standard group receive the intervention. The analysis of data in the second period is complex.CONCLUSION: The fast-track trial has been used successfully in palliative care among patients severely affected by multiple sclerosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and cancer. It is best suited to evaluations of palliative care services among patients who have longer prognoses, for example of several months or more although it has been used in people with prognoses of weeks.","['Data Collection', 'Evaluation Studies as Topic', 'Humans', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Palliative Care', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Research Design', 'Waiting Lists', 'Workforce']",21993806,"[['E05.318.308', 'L01.399.250', 'N05.715.360.300', 'N06.850.520.308'], ['E05.337', 'N05.715.360.335'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C10.114.375.500', 'C10.314.350.500', 'C20.111.258.250.500'], ['E02.760.666', 'N02.421.585.666'], ['E05.318.372.250.250.365.500', 'N05.715.360.330.250.250.365.500', 'N06.850.520.450.250.250.365.500'], ['E05.581.500', 'H01.770.644.728'], ['N04.452.095.738'], ['N04.452.525']]","['Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]']",0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0
Comparison of an auto-stereoscopic display and polarized stereoscopic projection for macroscopic pathology.,"We investigated stereoscopic imaging for gross examination in telepathology. A conventional macroscopic station was equipped with two cameras mounted 6.5 cm apart and images were produced of 30 different routine pathology specimens. Still images were displayed on a three-dimensional auto-stereoscopic display with a lenticular plate (which did not require the viewer to wear special glasses) and as a three-dimensional projection that required the viewer to wear glasses with polarized lenses. Nine observers (pathologists, laboratory technicians and engineers) viewed the three-dimensional images first on the auto-stereoscopic display and then with polarized projection. The observers scored the images for spatial reproduction, surface structure, proportions, colour and sharpness (10 indices in total, each rated on a five-point Likert scale of 1-5, with lower scores indicating better quality). Results were compared with those from five observers who had previously viewed the corresponding two-dimensional images on a conventional (two-dimensional) display. The mean scores across each of the 10 indices were 2.9 (two-dimensional display), 2.1 (auto-stereoscopic display) and 1.6 (polarized projection). All observers stated that the polarized projection had superior image quality with regard to resolution, colour and surface structures. The results obtained in the present study with still images have encouraged us to integrate stereoscopy into a dynamic telepathology system.","['Automation', 'Equipment Design', 'Humans', 'Image Processing, Computer-Assisted', 'Pathology']",15273030,"[['J01.897.104'], ['E05.320'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['L01.224.308'], ['H02.403.650']]","['Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]']",0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0
Perceptions of Hospital-Dependent Patients on Their Needs for Hospitalization.,"In the United States, older adults account for a significant proportion of hospitalizations, and a subset become hospital-dependent, for reasons that are unclear. We conducted a qualitative study to explore these individuals' perspectives on their need for hospitalizations. Twenty patients hospitalized at an academic medical center underwent semistructured qualitative interviews. Criteria for selection included age 65 and older, at least three hospitalizations over six months, admission to the medical service at the time of the study, did not meet criteria for chronic critical illness, was not comfort measures only, and did not have a conservator. Interviews were audiotaped, transcribed, and inductively analyzed. The major themes derived were the necessity and inevitability of hospitalizations (""You have to bring me in here""), feeling safe in the hospital (""It makes me feel more secure""), patients hospitalized despite having outside medical and social support (""I have everything""), and inadequate goals-of-care discussions (""It just doesn't occur to me""). Results suggested that candid discussions about health trajectories are needed to ensure hospitalization is consistent with the patient's realistic health priorities.

Three weeks of early-onset exercise prolongs obesity resistance in DIO rats after exercise cessation.,"We assessed the effect of early-onset exercise as a means of preventing childhood obesity using juvenile male rats selectively bred to develop diet-induced obesity (DIO) or to be diet resistant (DR) when fed a 31% fat high-energy diet. Voluntary wheel running begun at 36 days of age selectively reduced adiposity in DIO vs. DR rats. Other 4-wk-old DIO rats fed a high-energy diet and exercised (Ex) for 13 wk increased their core temperature, gained 22% less body weight, and had 39% lighter fat pads compared with sedentary (Sed) rats. When wheels were removed after 6 wk (6 wk Ex/7 wk Sed), rats gained less body weight over the next 7 wk than Sed rats and still had comparable adipose pad weights to 13-wk-exercised rats. In fact, only 3 wk of exercise sufficed to prevent obesity for 10 wk after wheel removal. Terminally, the 6-wk-Ex/7-wk-Sed rats had a 55% increase in arcuate nucleus proopiomelanocortin mRNA expression vs. Sed rats, suggesting that this contributed to their sustained obesity resistance. Finally, when Sed rats were calorically restricted for 6 wk to weight match them to Ex rats (6 wk Rstr/7 wk Al), they increased their intake and body weight when fed ad libitum and, after 7 wk more, had higher leptin levels and adiposity than Sed rats. Thus, early-onset exercise may favorably alter, while early caloric restriction may unfavorably influence, the development of the hypothalamic pathways controlling energy homeostasis during brain development.","['Adipose Tissue', 'Animal Feed', 'Animals', 'Body Weight', 'Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor', 'Caloric Restriction', 'Eating', 'Hypothalamus', 'Insulin', 'Leptin', 'Male', 'Neuropeptide Y', 'Obesity', 'Physical Conditioning, Animal', 'Pro-Opiomelanocortin', 'RNA, Messenger', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred Strains', 'Receptors, Leptin', 'Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 3 Protein', 'Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling Proteins']",17989137,"[['A10.165.114'], ['G07.203.300.300.100', 'J02.500.300.100'], ['B01.050'], ['C23.888.144', 'E01.370.600.115.100.160.120', 'E05.041.124.160.750', 'G07.100.100.160.120', 'G07.345.249.314.120'], ['D12.644.276.860.100', 'D12.776.467.860.100', 'D12.776.631.600.100', 'D23.529.850.100'], ['E02.642.249.200', 'G07.203.650.240.340.150'], ['G07.203.650.283', 'G10.261.330'], ['A08.186.211.180.497', 'A08.186.211.200.317.357'], ['D06.472.699.587.200.500.625', 'D12.644.548.586.200.500.625'], ['D06.472.699.042.500', 'D12.644.276.024.500', 'D12.644.548.011.500', 'D12.776.467.024.500', 'D23.529.024.500'], ['D12.644.400.500', 'D12.776.631.650.500'], ['C18.654.726.500', 'C23.888.144.699.500', 'E01.370.600.115.100.160.120.699.500', 'G07.100.100.160.120.699.500'], ['G11.427.410.698.277.280'], ['D06.472.699.327.935', 'D06.472.699.631.525.600', 'D12.644.400.400.935', 'D12.644.548.365.935', 'D12.644.548.691.525.690', 'D12.776.631.650.405.935', 'D12.776.811.800'], ['D13.444.735.544'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700'], ['B01.050.050.199.520.760', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700.400'], ['D12.776.543.750.650.500'], ['D12.644.360.024.374.750', 'D12.776.157.057.249.750', 'D12.776.476.024.437.750'], ['D12.644.360.024.374', 'D12.776.157.057.249', 'D12.776.476.024.437']]","['Anatomy [A]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
Identification of mimotopes by screening of a bacterially displayed random peptide library and its use in eliciting an immune response to native HBV-preS.,"Bacterially-displayed peptide libraries have been widely used as an alternative to phage-displayed peptide libraries in screening epitopes or mimotopes of antibodies. Using a protective monoclonal antibody (mAb) 3B9 against hepatitis B virus (HBV) preS protein as target, mimotopes were successfully screened from a FliTrx random peptide library. To monitor the enrichment ratios of each round and to isolate higher affinity clones from the library, a modified procedure was performed in which the titer of eluted bacteria from an antibody-coated well (P value) was compared with that from a non-coated well (N value). After sufficient enrichment of the library, bacterial colonies were randomly picked and identified further by the monoclonal bacterial P/N value assay and Western blotting analysis. Immunization of mice with the selected bacterially-displayed mimotopes, including the enriched populations without clone identification, elicited strong specific immune responses against the recombinant preS protein. The present study provides a potentially rapid and effective strategy for the development of engineered live bacterial vaccines without the need for information about the aetiological agents or their antigens.","['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antibodies, Viral', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Epitopes', 'Female', 'Hepatitis B Surface Antigens', 'Hepatitis B virus', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Peptide Library', 'Protein Precursors']",14505920,"[['B01.050'], ['D12.776.124.486.485.114.224', 'D12.776.124.790.651.114.224', 'D12.776.377.715.548.114.224'], ['D12.776.124.486.485.114.254', 'D12.776.124.790.651.114.254', 'D12.776.377.715.548.114.254'], ['E05.196.401.143', 'E05.301.300.096', 'E05.478.566.320.200', 'E05.601.262', 'E05.601.470.320.200'], ['E05.393.220'], ['D13.444.308'], ['E05.478.566.350.170', 'E05.478.566.380.360', 'E05.478.583.400.170', 'E05.601.470.350.170', 'E05.601.470.380.360'], ['D23.050.550'], ['D23.050.327.495.500.475'], ['B04.280.375.650.425', 'B04.450.390.650.425'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500'], ['B01.050.050.199.520.520.338', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500.400.338'], ['D12.644.555', 'G02.111.570.060.620', 'G05.360.325.640'], ['D12.776.811']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Restenosis after transluminal coronary angioplasty detected with exercise-gated radionuclide ventriculography.,"Forty-one patients were evaluated with exercise-gated radionuclide ventriculography before and within 4 days after successful transluminal coronary angioplasty and 4 to 12 months later. Patients were subgrouped according to the degree of restenosis demonstrated angiographically at 4 to 12 months (Group I [n = 23]: less than or equal to 20%; Group II [n = 10]: greater than 20% but less than 50%; Group III [n = 8]: greater than or equal to 50%). Patients with abnormal findings on gated radionuclide ventriculography (less than 5 point increase in ejection fraction or wall motion deterioration) early after angioplasty were eventually found to have a greater degree of restenosis than were patients with normal findings (41.2 +/- 30.3 versus 19.0 +/- 25.4% restenosis, p less than 0.0001). The accuracy of abnormal radionuclide ventriculography in predicting 50% or greater restenosis was 73% immediately after angioplasty and 77% at the time of follow-up angiography. Gated radionuclide ventriculographic results were abnormal in 5% of Group I patients compared with 75% of Group III patients (p less than 0.01) early after angioplasty; at late follow-up, they were abnormal in 27% of Group I patients compared with 88% of Group III patients (p less than 0.01). Group I patients had a greater increase in ejection fraction than did Group III patients at early (+11.3 +/- 7.5 versus + 3.5 +/- 6.5 points, p less than 0.01) and late (+11.8 +/- 7.8 versus -1.9 +/- 8.7 points, p less than 0.0005) follow-up.

Influence of Block Copolymerization on the Antifreeze Protein Mimetic Ice Recrystallization Inhibition Activity of Poly(vinyl alcohol).,"Antifreeze (glyco) proteins are produced by many cold-acclimatized species to enable them to survive subzero temperatures. These proteins have multiple macroscopic effects on ice crystal growth which makes them appealing for low-temperature applications-from cellular cryopreservation to food storage. Poly(vinyl alcohol) has remarkable ice recrystallization inhibition activity, but its mode of action is uncertain as is the extent at which it can be incorporated into other high-order structures. Here the synthesis and characterization of well-defined block copolymers containing poly(vinyl alcohol) and poly(vinylpyrrolidone) by RAFT/MADIX polymerization is reported, as new antifreeze protein mimetics. The effect of adding a large second hydrophilic block is studied across a range of compositions, and it is found to be a passive component in ice recrystallization inhibition assays, enabling retention of all activity. In the extreme case, a block copolymer with only 10% poly(vinyl alcohol) was found to retain all activity, where statistical copolymers of PVA lose all activity with very minor changes to composition. These findings present a new method to increase the complexity of antifreeze protein mimetic materials, while retaining activity, and also to help understand the underlying mechanisms of action.","['Antifreeze Proteins', 'Biomimetic Materials', 'Cryoprotective Agents', 'Crystallization', 'Hydrophobic and Hydrophilic Interactions', 'Ice', 'Polymerization', 'Polyvinyl Alcohol']",27476873,"[['D12.776.053'], ['J01.637.087'], ['D27.505.696.706.320', 'D27.720.799.180'], ['E05.196.300', 'G02.171'], ['G02.409'], ['D01.045.250.875.400', 'D01.248.497.158.459.650.400', 'D01.650.550.925.400', 'G16.500.275.410', 'G16.500.750.775.342', 'N06.230.291'], ['G02.750'], ['D02.033.750', 'D02.455.326.271.884.533.532', 'D05.750.716.721.616', 'D25.720.716.721.616', 'J01.637.051.720.716.721.616']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Health Care [N]']",0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0
"Penile cancer: importance of circumcision, human papillomavirus and smoking in in situ and invasive disease.","Few population-based case-control studies have assessed etiologic factors for penile cancer. Past infection with high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) is a known risk factor for penile cancer; however, few previous studies have related the HPV DNA status of the tumor to potential demographic and behavioral risk factors for the disease or evaluated whether in situ and invasive penile cancer share risk factors. Little information is available on the role and timing of circumcision in the etiology of penile cancer. We conducted a population-based case-control study in western Washington state that included 137 men diagnosed with in situ (n = 75) or invasive (n = 62) penile cancer between January 1, 1979, and December 31, 1998, and 671 control men identified through random digit dialing. Cases and controls were interviewed in person and provided peripheral blood samples. Case and control blood samples were tested for antibodies to HPV16 and HSV-2, and tumor specimens from cases were tested for HPV DNA. Men not circumcised during childhood were at increased risk of invasive (OR = 2.3, 95% CI 1.3-4.1) but not in situ (OR = 1.1, 95% CI 0.6-1.8) penile cancer. Approximately 35% of men with penile cancer who had not been circumcised in childhood reported a history of phimosis compared to 7.6% of controls (OR = 7.4, 95% CI 3.7-15.0). Penile conditions such as tear, rash and injury were associated with increased risk of disease. Among men not circumcised in childhood, phimosis was strongly associated with development of invasive penile cancer (OR = 11.4, 95% CI 5.0-25.9). When we restricted our analysis to men who did not have phimosis, the risk of invasive penile cancer associated with not having been circumcised in childhood was not elevated (OR = 0.5, 95% CI 0.1-2.5). Cigarette smoking was associated with a 4.5-fold risk (95% CI 2.0-10.1) of invasive penile cancer. HPV DNA was detected in 79.8% of tumor specimens, and 69.1% of tumors were HPV16-positive. The proportion of HPV DNA-positive tumors did not vary by any risk factors evaluated. Many risk factors were common for both in situ and invasive disease. However, 3 factors that did not increase the risk for in situ cancer proved significant risk factors for invasive penile cancer: lack of circumcision during childhood, phimosis and cigarette smoking. The high percentage of HPV DNA-positive tumors in our study is consistent with a strong association between HPV infection and the development of penile cancer regardless of circumcision status. Circumcision in early childhood may help prevent penile cancer by eliminating phimosis, a significant risk factor for the disease.","['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Circumcision, Male', 'DNA, Viral', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness', 'Papillomavirus Infections', 'Penile Neoplasms', 'Phimosis', 'Risk Factors', 'Smoking']",15825185,"[['M01.060.057'], ['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['E05.318.372.500.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.500'], ['E02.218.085.170', 'E04.085.170', 'E04.950.774.860.226'], ['D13.444.308.568'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['C04.697.645', 'C23.550.727.645'], ['C01.925.256.650', 'C01.925.928.725'], ['C04.588.945.440.715', 'C12.294.260.500', 'C12.294.494.591', 'C12.758.409.500'], ['C12.294.494.684'], ['E05.318.740.600.800.725', 'N05.715.350.200.700', 'N05.715.360.750.625.700.700', 'N06.850.490.625.750', 'N06.850.520.830.600.800.725'], ['F01.145.805']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]']",0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
How--and why--to request an autopsy.,"Autopsy remains the touch-stone of diagnosis, but clinicians are often reluctant to request the procedure because of their discomfort in approaching the family. Fundamental to a successful autopsy request is sensitivity for the family's feelings, which bespeaks respect for the deceased and the family. For example, in announcing the death and requesting autopsy, the clinician should bring the family to the hospital and talk with them privately. If they have questions or reservations about autopsy, the clinician should answer honestly and simply, stressing the benefits of the procedure to the family and society as a whole. Since the manner of request influences the family's decision in about one third of cases, efforts at overcoming personal reluctance in requesting autopsy are worthwhile. Clinical excellence develops through effort and practice in this activity as in any other.","['Autopsy', 'Communication', 'Death', 'Family', 'Informed Consent', 'Mortuary Practice', 'Professional-Family Relations']",3975184,"[['E01.370.060', 'E05.070', 'I01.198.780.937.120'], ['F01.145.209', 'L01.143'], ['C23.550.260'], ['F01.829.263', 'I01.880.853.150'], ['I01.880.604.473.650.718', 'I01.880.604.583.427', 'N03.706.437.650.312', 'N03.706.535.489'], ['H02.438'], ['F01.829.401.550']]","['Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]']",0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0
Characterization of acetate transport in colorectal cancer cells and potential therapeutic implications.,"Acetate, together with other short chain fatty acids has been implicated in colorectal cancer (CRC) prevention/therapy. Acetate was shown to induce apoptosis in CRC cells. The precise mechanism underlying acetate transport across CRC cells membrane, that may be implicated in its selectivity towards CRC cells, is not fully understood and was addressed here. We also assessed the effect of acetate in CRC glycolytic metabolism and explored its use in combination with the glycolytic inhibitor 3-bromopyruvate (3BP). We provide evidence that acetate enters CRC cells by the secondary active transporters MCT1 and/or MCT2 and SMCT1 as well as by facilitated diffusion via aquaporins. CRC cell exposure to acetate upregulates the expression of MCT1, MCT4 and CD147, while promoting MCT1 plasma membrane localization. We also observed that acetate increases CRC cell glycolytic phenotype and that acetate-induced apoptosis and anti-proliferative effect was potentiated by 3BP. Our data suggest that acetate selectivity towards CRC cells might be explained by the fact that aquaporins and MCTs are found overexpressed in CRC clinical cases. Our work highlights the importance that acetate transport regulation has in the use of drugs such as 3BP as a new therapeutic strategy for CRC.","['Acetates', 'Biological Transport', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Colorectal Neoplasms', 'Glycolysis', 'Humans', 'Monocarboxylic Acid Transporters', 'Muscle Proteins', 'Pyruvates', 'Symporters']",28874966,"[['D02.241.081.018', 'D10.251.400.045'], ['G03.143'], ['A11.251.210.190', 'A11.251.860.180'], ['C04.588.274.476.411.307', 'C06.301.371.411.307', 'C06.405.249.411.307', 'C06.405.469.158.356', 'C06.405.469.491.307', 'C06.405.469.860.180'], ['G02.111.158.750', 'G03.191.750', 'G03.295.436', 'G03.493.360'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D12.776.157.530.450.074.500.400', 'D12.776.543.585.450.074.500.300'], ['D12.776.210.500'], ['D02.241.755.812'], ['D12.776.157.530.450.625', 'D12.776.543.585.450.625']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]']",1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
[Performance of the Hemoccult test in the screening of colorectal cancer and adenoma. Results of 5 screening campaigns in Sa?ne-et-Loire].,"OBJECTIVES: The aim of this population-based study was to specify the positivity rate, the positive predictive value of Hemoccult test as well as the characteristics of the cancers and adenomas screened during the successive colorectal cancer screening campaigns.METHODS: This study focused on five colorectal cancer mass screening campaigns by Hemoccult test carried out between 1988 and 1996. The test was offered every two years to a cohort of subjects born between 1914 and 1943 and living in some districts of the Sa?ne-et-Loire administrative area.RESULTS: The positivity rate of the test was higher in the first campaign (2.1%) than in the subsequent ones (mean 1.3%). It was also higher in males than in females and it increased with age. After a positive test, 85.4% of the subjects had a colonic exploration. The exploration rate was higher when the test was offered by general practitioners (88.0%) than when it was mailed (77.8%) (P < 0.01). Through this test, cancer was detected in 168 patients, and one adenoma or more in 414 patients. The positive predictive value was 11.4% for cancer, 17.1% for adenoma > or = 1 cm and 11.1 for adenoma < 1 cm. It was higher in males than in females and it increased with age. Depending on the campaigns, 35.9% to 47.3% of the subjects explored after a positive test had a cancer or an adenoma. The screened cancers or adenomas were more often localized in the sigmoid or the rectum. Three quarters of screened cancers were stage I or II (TNM classification). All together, 82.7% of cancers were treated with surgical resection for cure and 10.1% with endoscopic resection.CONCLUSIONS: This work confirms the feasibility of carrying out regular colorectal cancer screening campaigns, through which a few subjects can be selected for undergoing colonic explorations. These latter can detect a cancer or adenoma in 40% of cases.","['Adenoma', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Colorectal Neoplasms', 'Female', 'France', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mass Screening', 'Middle Aged', 'Occult Blood', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Retrospective Studies']",10429850,"[['C04.557.470.035'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['M01.060.116.100.080'], ['C04.588.274.476.411.307', 'C06.301.371.411.307', 'C06.405.249.411.307', 'C06.405.469.158.356', 'C06.405.469.491.307', 'C06.405.469.860.180'], ['Z01.542.286'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E01.370.500', 'E05.318.308.980.438.580', 'N02.421.726.233.443', 'N05.715.360.300.800.438.500', 'N06.850.520.308.980.438.580', 'N06.850.780.500'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['E01.370.225.925', 'E05.200.925'], ['E05.318.370.800.650', 'N05.715.360.325.700.640', 'N06.850.520.445.800.650'], ['E05.318.372.500.500.500', 'E05.318.372.500.750.750', 'N05.715.360.330.500.500.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.825', 'N06.850.520.450.500.500.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.825']]","['Diseases [C]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]']",0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1
"Social and racial inequalities in preterm births in Western Australia, 1984 to 2006.","Preterm birth is associated with a range of childhood morbidities and in industrialised societies is the primary cause of infant mortality. Social and racial inequalities in preterm birth have been reported in North America, UK, Europe and New Zealand. This study utilised population-level data to investigate social and racial inequalities in preterm birth among Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal infants in Western Australia. All live, singleton births between 1984 and 2006 (n = 567 468) were included, and multilevel multivariable logistic regression was used to investigate relative differences in preterm infants between socio-economic groups. Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal infants were analysed separately. The prevalence of preterm births increased from 7.1% in 1984-88 to 7.5% in 1999-2003, before decreasing to 7.2% in 2004-06. Inequalities in preterm births between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal infants increased over time, with the percentage of preterm births being almost twofold higher for Aboriginal infants (14.8%), compared with non-Aboriginal infants (7.6%). A significant portion of the disparity between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal infants is attributable to parental socio-economic and demographic characteristics, though the disparity continues to persist even after adjustment for these factors. While the overall rates of preterm birth in Western Australia have remained fairly static over the last two decades, the disparity between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal infants has increased and is now similar to inequalities seen 20 years ago. These findings highlight a major public health issue that should be of great concern, given the short- and long-term morbidities and complications associated with preterm birth.","['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Logistic Models', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Oceanic Ancestry Group', 'Population Surveillance', 'Premature Birth', 'Prevalence', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Western Australia', 'Young Adult']",20618725,"[['M01.060.057'], ['M01.060.116'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.703.520'], ['E05.318.740.500.525', 'E05.318.740.600.800.450', 'E05.318.740.750.450', 'E05.599.835.875', 'N05.715.360.750.530.480', 'N05.715.360.750.625.700.450', 'N05.715.360.750.695.470', 'N06.850.520.830.500.525', 'N06.850.520.830.600.800.450', 'N06.850.520.830.750.450'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['M01.686.508.600'], ['E05.318.308.980.438.700', 'N05.715.360.300.800.438.625', 'N06.850.520.308.980.438.700', 'N06.850.780.675'], ['C13.703.420.491.500'], ['E05.318.308.985.525.750', 'N01.224.935.597.750', 'N06.850.505.400.975.525.750', 'N06.850.520.308.985.525.750'], ['I01.880.853.996', 'N01.824'], ['Z01.639.100.996', 'Z01.678.100.373.996'], ['M01.060.116.815']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Geographicals [Z]']",0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1
Allostery is an intrinsic property of the protease domain of DegS: implications for enzyme function and evolution.,"DegS is a periplasmic Escherichia coli protease, which functions as a trimer to catalyze the initial rate-limiting step in a proteolytic cascade that ultimately activates transcription of stress response genes in the cytoplasm. Each DegS subunit consists of a protease domain and a PDZ domain. During protein folding stress, DegS is allosterically activated by peptides exposed in misfolded outer membrane porins, which bind to the PDZ domain and stabilize the active protease. It is not known whether allostery is conferred by the PDZ domains or is an intrinsic feature of the trimeric protease domain. Here, we demonstrate that free DegS(ÄPDZ) equilibrates between active and inactive trimers with the latter species predominating. Substrate binding stabilizes active DegS(ÄPDZ) in a positively cooperative fashion. Mutations can also stabilize active DegS(ÄPDZ) and produce an enzyme that displays hyperbolic kinetics and degrades substrate with a maximal velocity within error of that for fully activated, intact DegS. Crystal structures of multiple DegS(ÄPDZ) variants, in functional and non-functional conformations, support a two-state model in which allosteric switching is mediated by changes in specific elements of tertiary structure in the context of an invariant trimeric base. Overall, our results indicate that protein substrates must bind sufficiently tightly and specifically to the functional conformation of DegS(ÄPDZ) to assist their own degradation. Thus, substrate binding alone may have regulated the activities of ancestral DegS trimers with subsequent fusion of the protease domain to a PDZ domain, resulting in ligand-mediated regulation.","['Allosteric Site', 'Bacterial Proteins', 'Crystallography, X-Ray', 'Dimerization', 'Escherichia coli', 'Escherichia coli Proteins', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Bacterial', 'Hydrogen Bonding', 'Kinetics', 'Mutation', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Folding', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary']",20739286,"[['G02.111.570.120.147'], ['D12.776.097'], ['E05.196.309.742.225'], ['G02.206', 'G03.230'], ['B03.440.450.425.325.300', 'B03.660.250.150.180.100'], ['D12.776.097.275'], ['G05.308.300'], ['G02.282'], ['G01.374.661', 'G02.111.490'], ['G05.365.590'], ['G02.111.679', 'G03.808'], ['G01.154.651', 'G02.111.688'], ['G02.111.570.820.709.610']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]']",0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
One-step synthesis of methylene-bridged bis-carbazole and evaluation of its antitumor activity and G-quadruplex DNA binding property.,"Most reported carbazolyl G-quadruplex DNA (G4-DNA) ligands possess a rigid structure rather than a flexible one. The conformationally flexible ligands are paid much less attention. In this study, we report a novel class of non-rigid methylene-bridged biscarbazolyl ligand and their G4-DNA binding properties. Moreover, the antitumor activities of all these oligomers have been evaluated. The results show that this family of oligomers could be facilely synthesized via solely one step. Among them, compound 2, the bis-carbazole derivative, displays the best antitumor activity and IC50 values against HT-29, HepG2, A375 and MCF-7 cells are 0.69, 5.09, 3.15 and 3.8 ì mol/L, respectively. Although conformationally flexible, 2 is still capable of binding to as well as stabilizing G4-DNA via ð-ð stacking interaction. Moreover, 2 selectively binds to G4-DNA over duplex DNA. The current study enriches the category of carbazolyl G4-DNA ligands and paves the way for the search of more efficient G4-DNA ligands and antitumor leads.","['Antineoplastic Agents', 'Apoptosis', 'Carbazoles', 'Cell Proliferation', 'DNA', 'G-Quadruplexes', 'Humans', 'Ligands', 'Neoplasms', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",31255989,"[['D27.505.954.248'], ['G04.146.954.035'], ['D03.633.100.473.144', 'D03.633.300.148'], ['G04.161.750', 'G07.345.249.410.750'], ['D13.444.308'], ['G02.111.570.820.486.550', 'G05.360.580.550'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D27.720.470.480'], ['C04'], ['G02.111.830', 'G07.690.773.997'], ['A11.251.860']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type R (PTPRR) antagonizes the Wnt signaling pathway in ovarian cancer by dephosphorylating and inactivating â-catenin.,"Despite a lack of mutations, accumulating evidence supports an important role for the Wnt/â-catenin pathway in ovarian tumorigenesis. However, the molecular mechanism that contributes to the aberrant activation of the Wnt signaling cascade in ovarian cancer has not been fully elucidated. Here, we found that protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type R (PTPRR) suppressed the activation of the Wnt/â-catenin pathway in ovarian cancer. We performed an shRNA-based biochemical screen, which identified PTPRR as being responsible for tyrosine dephosphorylation of â-catenin on Tyr-142, a key site controlling the transcriptional activity of â-catenin. Of note, PTPRR was down-regulated in ovarian cancers, and ectopic PTPRR re-expression delayed ovarian cancer cell growth both in vitro and in vivo Using a proximity-based tagging system and RNA-Seq analysis, we identified a signaling nexus that includes PTPRR, á-catenin, â-catenin, E-cadherin, and AT-rich interaction domain 3C (ARID3C) in ovarian cancer. Immunohistochemistry staining of human samples further suggested that PTPRR expression is inversely correlated with disease prognosis. Collectively, our findings indicate that PTPRR functions as a tumor suppressor in ovarian cancer by dephosphorylating and inactivating â-catenin. These results suggest that PTPRR expression might have utility as a prognostic marker for predicting overall survival.","['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Mice, Nude', 'Ovarian Neoplasms', 'Phosphorylation', 'RNA Interference', 'RNAi Therapeutics', 'Receptor-Like Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases, Class 7', 'Survival Analysis', 'Wnt Signaling Pathway', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays', 'beta Catenin']",31653698,"[['B01.050'], ['A11.251.210'], ['A11.251.210.190', 'A11.251.860.180'], ['E05.393.332'], ['G05.308.370'], ['A11.251.210.172.750', 'A11.436.334'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500.550.500'], ['C04.588.322.455', 'C13.351.500.056.630.705', 'C13.351.937.418.685', 'C19.344.410', 'C19.391.630.705'], ['G02.111.665', 'G02.607.780', 'G03.796'], ['G05.308.203.374.790'], ['E02.095.301.250'], ['D08.811.277.352.650.775.400.700', 'D12.644.360.587.700', 'D12.776.476.592.700'], ['E05.318.740.998', 'N05.715.360.750.795', 'N06.850.520.830.998'], ['G02.111.820.925', 'G04.835.925'], ['E05.337.550.200.900', 'E05.624.850'], ['D12.776.091.249', 'D12.776.220.145.500', 'D12.776.930.130']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Health Care [N]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
Involvement of polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) in mitotic arrest by inhibition of mitogen-activated protein kinase-extracellular signal-regulated kinase-ribosomal S6 kinase 1 (MEK-ERK-RSK1) cascade.,"Cell division is controlled through cooperation of different kinases. Of these, polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) and p90 ribosomal S6 kinase 1 (RSK1) play key roles. Plk1 acts as a G(2)/M trigger, and RSK1 promotes G(1) progression. Although previous reports show that Plk1 is suppressed by RSK1 during meiosis in Xenopus oocytes, it is still not clear whether this is the case during mitosis or whether Plk1 counteracts the effects of RSK1. Few animal models are available for the study of controlled and transient cell cycle arrest. Here we show that encysted embryos (cysts) of the primitive crustacean Artemia are ideal for such research because they undergo complete cell cycle arrest when they enter diapause (a state of obligate dormancy). We found that Plk1 suppressed the activity of RSK1 during embryonic mitosis and that Plk1 was inhibited during embryonic diapause and mitotic arrest. In addition, studies on HeLa cells using Plk1 siRNA interference and overexpression showed that phosphorylation of RSK1 increased upon interference and decreased after overexpression, suggesting that Plk1 inhibits RSK1. Taken together, these findings provide insights into the regulation of Plk1 during cell division and Artemia diapause cyst formation and the correlation between the activity of Plk1 and RSK1.","['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Artemia', 'Aurora Kinases', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoints', 'Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases', 'Mitosis', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'RNA Interference', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Ribosomal Protein S6 Kinases, 90-kDa', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Signal Transduction']",22427657,"[['G02.111.570.060', 'L01.453.245.667.060'], ['B01.050'], ['B01.050.500.131.365.060.050'], ['D08.811.913.696.620.682.700.103', 'D12.776.167.049'], ['G02.111.570.080', 'G05.360.080', 'L01.453.245.667.080'], ['E05.196.401.143', 'E05.301.300.096', 'E05.478.566.320.200', 'E05.601.262', 'E05.601.470.320.200'], ['G04.144.109'], ['D12.776.167'], ['D08.811.913.696.620.682.700.567.249', 'D12.644.360.450.169', 'D12.776.476.450.169'], ['G05.308.310'], ['G05.308.320'], ['A11.251.210.190.400', 'A11.251.860.180.400', 'A11.436.340'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D08.811.913.696.620.682.700.567', 'D12.644.360.450', 'D12.776.476.450'], ['G04.144.220.220.781', 'G05.113.220.781'], ['L01.453.245.667'], ['G02.111.665', 'G02.607.780', 'G03.796'], ['D08.811.913.696.620.682.700'], ['D12.776.624.664.700'], ['G05.308.203.374.790'], ['E05.393.620.500.725'], ['D08.811.913.696.620.682.700.862.500', 'D12.644.360.600.500', 'D12.776.476.600.500'], ['G02.111.810.200', 'G05.810.200'], ['G02.111.820', 'G04.835']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
Discovery and Characterization of Cyclotides from Rinorea Species.,"Cyclotides are macrocyclic cystine-knotted peptides most commonly found in the Violaceae plant family. Although Rinorea is the second-largest genera within the Violaceae family, few studies have examined whether or not they contain cyclotides. To further our understanding of cyclotide diversity and evolution, we examined the cyclotide content of two Rinorea species found in Southeast Asia: R. virgata and R. bengalensis. Seven cyclotides were isolated from R. virgata (named Rivi1-7), and a known cyclotide (cT10) was found in R. bengalensis. Loops 2, 5, and 6 of Rivi1-4 contained sequences not previously seen in corresponding loops of known cyclotides, thereby expanding our understanding of the diversity of cyclotides. In addition, the sequence of loop 2 of Rivi3 and Rivi4 were identical to some related noncyclic ""acyclotides"" from the Poaceae plant family. As only acyclotides, but not cyclotides, have been reported in monocotyledons thus far, our findings support an evolutionary link between monocotyledon-derived ancestral cyclotide precursors and dicotyledon-derived cyclotides. Furthermore, Rivi2 and Rivi3 had comparable cytotoxic activities to the most cytotoxic cyclotide known to date: cycloviolacin O2 from Viola odorata; yet, unlike cycloviolacin O2, they did not show hemolytic activity. Therefore, these cyclotides represent novel scaffolds for use in future anticancer drug design.","['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Cyclotides', 'Plant Extracts', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry', 'Violaceae']",30387611,"[['G02.111.570.060', 'L01.453.245.667.060'], ['E05.196.181.400.300'], ['D12.644.641.243'], ['D20.215.784.500', 'D26.667'], ['G02.111.810.200', 'G05.810.200'], ['E05.196.566.600'], ['E05.196.566.880'], ['B01.650.940.800.575.912.250.859.797.962']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]']",0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
Twenty-four hour blood pressure and heart rate profiles of diabetic patients with abnormal cardiovascular reflexes.,"Twenty-four hour ambulatory blood pressure and heart rate profiles of 24 patients with diabetes were monitored in order to assess the effect of autonomic neuropathy on 24-h haemodynamic profiles. Eighteen patients had abnormal cardiovascular reflexes. Mean arterial pressure rose at night in six of the patients with autonomic neuropathy and fell by less than or equal to 5 mmHg in seven. In the remaining five patients with autonomic neuropathy and in the six diabetic patients with normal cardiovascular reflexes, the fall in nocturnal mean arterial pressure was comparable to that of 11 non-diabetic patients with essential hypertension. Median 24-h mean arterial pressure was similar in all four groups of diabetic patients. Prevalence of autonomic symptoms was not related to the change in blood pressure in those with autonomic neuropathy. Twenty-seven months after monitoring, three fatal and five severe non-fatal cardiovascular or renal events had occurred in four of the six patients with a rise in nocturnal blood pressure, compared with one non-fatal event in those with a small fall and no severe events in those with a pronounced fall (p = 0.02). Blood pressure rises at night in certain diabetic patients with abnormal cardiovascular reflexes and the nocturnal rise appears to be associated with a poor prognosis.","['Adult', 'Blood Pressure', 'Circadian Rhythm', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetic Angiopathies', 'Diabetic Neuropathies', 'Female', 'Heart Rate', 'Humans', 'Hypertension', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Monitoring, Physiologic', 'Posture', 'Respiration', 'Valsalva Maneuver']",1830525,"[['M01.060.116'], ['E01.370.600.875.249', 'G09.330.380.076'], ['G07.180.562.190'], ['C18.452.394.750', 'C19.246'], ['C14.907.320', 'C19.246.099.500'], ['C10.668.829.300', 'C19.246.099.937'], ['E01.370.600.875.500', 'G09.330.380.500'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C14.907.489'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['E01.370.520'], ['G11.427.695'], ['G09.772.705'], ['E01.370.370.380.950', 'E01.370.386.700.950', 'G09.330.380.875', 'G09.772.910']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]']",0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
The impact of histology on recurrence patterns in esophageal cancer treated with definitive chemoradiotherapy.,"BACKGROUND: To assess the impact of histology on recurrence patterns and survival outcomes in patients with esophageal cancer (EC) treated with definitive chemoradiotherapy (CRT).METHODS: We analyzed 590 consecutive EC patients who received definitive CRT from 1998 to 2014, including 182 patients (30.8%) with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and 408 (69.2%) with adenocarcinoma. Recurrence pattern and timing, survival, and potential prognostic factors were compared.RESULTS: After a median follow-up time of 58.0months, the SCC group demonstrated a comparable locoregional recurrence rate (42.9% vs. 38.0%, P=0.264) but a significantly lower distant failure rate (27.5% vs. 48.0%, P<0.001) than adenocarcinoma group. No significant difference was found in overall survival or locoregional failure-free survival between groups, whereas the SCC group was associated with significantly more favorable recurrence-free survival (P=0.009) and distant metastasis-free survival (P<0.001). The adenocarcinoma group had higher hematogenous metastasis rates of bone, brain, and liver, whereas the SCC group had a marginally higher regional recurrence rate. Among patients who received salvage surgery after locoregional recurrence, no significant difference in survival was found between groups (P=0.12).CONCLUSIONS: The patterns and sites of recurrence, survival outcomes, and prognostic factors were significantly different between esophageal SCC and adenocarcinoma.","['Adenocarcinoma', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell', 'Chemoradiotherapy', 'Cisplatin', 'Esophageal Neoplasms', 'Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Salvage Therapy', 'Young Adult']",28687396,"[['C04.557.470.200.025'], ['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['M01.060.116.100.080'], ['C04.557.470.200.400', 'C04.557.470.700.400'], ['E02.186.079', 'E02.319.164', 'E02.815.160'], ['D01.210.375', 'D01.625.125', 'D01.710.100'], ['C04.588.274.476.205', 'C04.588.443.353', 'C06.301.371.205', 'C06.405.117.430', 'C06.405.249.205'], ['C04.557.470.200.400.330', 'C04.557.470.700.400.565', 'C04.588.274.476.205.500', 'C04.588.443.353.500', 'C06.301.371.205.500', 'C06.405.117.430.500', 'C06.405.249.205.500'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['C04.697.655', 'C23.550.727.655'], ['E05.318.372.500.500.500', 'E05.318.372.500.750.750', 'N05.715.360.330.500.500.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.825', 'N06.850.520.450.500.500.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.825'], ['E02.895'], ['M01.060.116.815']]","['Diseases [C]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Health Care [N]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
Geographical distribution of Vip3Aa20 resistance allele frequencies in Spodoptera frugiperda (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) populations in Brazil.,"BACKGROUND: The use of Bt plants has been the main strategy for controlling the fall armyworm Spodoptera frugiperda (J. E. Smith) in Brazil. However, many resistance cases were already registered. The resistance of S. frugiperda to the Vip3Aa20 protein was recently characterized under laboratory conditions but it is still efficient under field conditions. Here, resistance monitoring studies were conducted using phenotypic (purified protein and Bt maize leaves) and genotypic (F1 and F2 screen) methods to support insect resistance management (IRM) programs and preserve Vip3Aa20 technology on maize.RESULTS: Phenotypic monitoring with purified protein showed two populations significantly different from the susceptible strain on the second crop season in 2016. This number increased for the first and second crop seasons in 2017 in several regions. The genotypic monitoring estimated a mean frequency of the resistance allele of 0.0027 for the F1 screen and 0.0033 for the F2 screen. Three new resistant strains to Vip3Aa20 were selected from F2 screen assays. Complementation tests on these new resistant strains were positive with the previous resistant strain.CONCLUSION: Here we showed that the resistance allele of S. frugiperda to Vip3Aa20 protein is widely distributed in maize-producing regions in Brazil and its frequency increases throughout crop seasons. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry.","['Animals', 'Bacterial Proteins', 'Brazil', 'Endotoxins', 'Gene Frequency', 'Hemolysin Proteins', 'Insect Proteins', 'Insecticide Resistance', 'Larva', 'Plants, Genetically Modified', 'Spodoptera', 'Zea mays']",31106516,"[['B01.050'], ['D12.776.097'], ['Z01.107.757.176'], ['D23.946.123.329'], ['G05.330'], ['D12.776.543.695.444'], ['D12.776.093.500'], ['G07.690.773.984.491'], ['B05.500.500', 'G07.345.500.550.500.500'], ['B01.650.520', 'B05.620.600'], ['B01.050.500.131.617.720.500.500.937.650.700'], ['B01.650.940.800.575.912.250.822.966']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"A test of a mitochondrial gene-based phylogeny of woodpeckers (genus Picoides) using an independent nuclear gene, beta-fibrinogen intron 7.","A conservative estimate of the species tree for the woodpecker genus Picoides based on two mitochondrial protein-coding genes is tested using sequences of an independently evolving nuclear intron, beta-fibrinogen intron 7. The mitochondrial gene-based topology and the intron-based topology are concordant, and a partition-homogeneity statistical test did not detect phylogenetic heterogeneity. The intron evolves more slowly than the mitochondrial sequences and tends not to resolve relationships among recently evolved species. However, the intron is superior over mitochondrial genes in resolving older bifurcations in the phylogeny. The two data sets were combined resulting in a robust estimate of the Picoides species tree in which most every node is statistically supported by bootstrap proportions. The Picoides species tree clearly shows that many morphological and behavioral characters used to lump species into this single genus have evolved by convergent evolution. Picoides is considered the largest genus of woodpeckers, but the molecular-based species tree suggests that Picoides is actually a conglomerate of several smaller groups.","['Animals', 'Birds', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cytochrome b Group', 'DNA', 'DNA, Mitochondrial', 'Electron Transport Complex IV', 'Fibrinogen', 'Introns', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Phylogeny', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA']",11820845,"[['B01.050'], ['B01.050.150.900.248'], ['A11.284.430.106', 'A11.284.430.214.190.875.117'], ['D08.244.187', 'D12.776.422.220.187'], ['D13.444.308'], ['D13.444.308.283.225'], ['D05.500.562.374', 'D08.811.600.250.687', 'D08.811.682.285', 'D12.776.157.530.450.250.875.304', 'D12.776.543.277.687', 'D12.776.543.585.450.250.875.484'], ['D12.776.124.050.250', 'D12.776.124.125.500', 'D12.776.811.300', 'D23.119.490'], ['G05.360.340.024.220.400', 'G05.360.340.024.340.137.515'], ['L01.453.245.667'], ['G05.697', 'G16.075.605', 'L01.100.697'], ['E05.393.760.700']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
Teicoplanin vs vancomycin: cost-effectiveness comparisons.,"The rising incidence of methicillin-resistant staphylococci and resistant enterococci in recent years has led to increased use of vancomycin as an active combatant in the treatment of gram-positive infections. Teicoplanin is an investigational glycopeptide that shares a similar spectrum of activity with vancomycin and appears to have similar efficacy. Teicoplanin offers several theoretical advantages compared with vancomycin including once-daily dosing, fewer side effects, and the option for intramuscular administration. While these may be perceived as substantial advances in the glycopeptide class of antibiotics, teicoplanin will probably not replace the now generically available vancomycin on hospital formularies. If competitively priced as a once-daily dosing regimen, teicoplanin will likely gain initial acceptance as an alternative in patients with an intolerance to vancomycin infusion-related side effects or in patients placed on combination aminoglycoside therapy for extended periods of treatment, as an intramuscular antibiotic in patients with poor venous access, and for routine antibiotic prophylaxis where protection from resistant gram-positive pathogens is important. The use of teicoplanin in the hospital may become more widespread as its side effect profile and economic advantages of less frequent dosing compared with vancomycin become better understood.","['Cost-Benefit Analysis', 'Drug Costs', 'Formularies, Hospital as Topic', 'Hospital Bed Capacity, 300 to 499', 'Humans', 'Michigan', 'Staphylococcal Infections', 'Teicoplanin', 'Vancomycin']",10123835,"[['N03.219.151.125'], ['N03.219.151.400.350', 'N05.300.375.300'], ['L01.178.682.192.836.535.561'], ['N02.278.306.472.180'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['Z01.107.567.875.350.500', 'Z01.107.567.875.510.500'], ['C01.150.252.410.868'], ['D09.400.420.405.500', 'D12.644.233.352.500'], ['D09.400.420.925', 'D12.644.233.925']]","['Health Care [N]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]']",0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1
Identification of recurrent and novel mutations in the LDL receptor gene in Spanish patients with familial hypercholesterolemia. Mutations in brief no. 135. Online.,"We used the single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) method to investigate 13 apparently unrelated Spanish patients with familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) for mutations in the promoter region and the 18 exons and their flanking intron sequences of the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor gene. We found 16 aberrant SSCP patterns, and the underlying mutations were characterized by DNA sequencing. Five novel missense mutations, Q71E, C74G, C95R, C281Y and D679E, and one nonsense mutation, Q133X, were identified. We also found six missense mutations, S156L, D200Y, D200G, E256K, T413K and C646Y, and one stop codon mutation, W(-18)X, that were previously described in patients from other populations. A new frameshift mutation, 2085del19, was found in one patient. We also identified three splicing mutations; two of them are novel mutations, 1706-10G->A and 2390-1G->A, and the other one has been reported recently, 313+1G->C. Four patients were found to carry two different mutations in the same allele: Q71E and 313+1G->C; C95R and D679E; W(-18)X and E256K, and C281Y and 1706-10G->A. Our results demonstrate that there is a broad spectrum of mutations in the LDL receptor gene in the Spanish population.","['DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Frameshift Mutation', 'Humans', 'Hyperlipoproteinemia Type II', 'Mutation, Missense', 'Polymorphism, Single-Stranded Conformational', 'Receptors, LDL', 'Spain']",10206683,"[['E05.393.760.700.300'], ['G05.365.590.265'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C16.320.565.398.481', 'C18.452.584.500.500.644.475', 'C18.452.648.398.481'], ['G05.365.590.650'], ['G05.365.795.600'], ['D12.776.543.750.710.450'], ['Z01.542.846']]","['Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Geographicals [Z]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

Five of the patients had combined general anomalies: mental retardation, deafness, cardiac malformation (ASD II), and luxatio coxae. In two of them chromosomal anomalies were found: 4p minus syndrome, mosaic trisomy 9.

Characterization of betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase (BetB) as an essential virulence factor of Brucella abortus.,"The pathogenic mechanisms of Brucellosis used to adapt to the harsh intracellular environment of the host cell are not fully understood. The present study investigated the in vitro and in vivo characteristics of B. abortus betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase (BetB) (Gene Bank ID: 006932) using a betB deletion mutant constructed from virulent B. abortus 544. In test under stress conditions, including osmotic- and acid stress-resistance, the betB mutant had a lower osmotic-resistance than B. abortus wild-type. In addition, the betB mutant showed higher internalization rates compared to the wild-type strain; however, it also displayed replication failures in HeLa cells and RAW 264.7 macrophages. During internalization, compared to the wild-type strain, the betB mutant was more adherent to the host surface and showed enhanced phosphorylation of protein kinases, two processes that promote phagocytic activity, in host cells. During intracellular trafficking, colocalization of B. abortus-containing phagosomes with LAMP-1 was elevated in betB mutant-infected cells compared to the wild-type cells. In mice, the betB mutant was predominantly cleared from spleens compared to the wild-type strain after 2 weeks post-infection, and the vaccination test with the live betB mutant showed effective protection against challenge infection with the virulent wild-type strain. These findings suggested that the B. abortus betB gene substantially affects the phagocytic pathway in human phagocytes and in host cells in mice. Furthermore, this study highlights the potential use of the B. abortus betB mutant as a live vaccine for the control of brucellosis.","['Animals', 'Bacterial Adhesion', 'Bacterial Vaccines', 'Betaine-Aldehyde Dehydrogenase', 'Brucella abortus', 'Brucellosis', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Macrophages', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Osmotic Pressure', 'Phagocytes', 'Sequence Deletion', 'Spleen', 'Virulence Factors']",24210811,"[['B01.050'], ['G06.099.050'], ['D20.215.894.135'], ['D08.811.682.657.163.515'], ['B03.440.400.425.215.500.100', 'B03.660.050.070.100.100'], ['C01.150.252.400.167'], ['A11.251.210.190.400', 'A11.251.860.180.400', 'A11.436.340'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['A11.329.372', 'A11.627.482', 'A11.733.397', 'A15.382.670.522', 'A15.382.680.397'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500'], ['B01.050.050.199.520.520.338', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500.400.338'], ['G01.374.715.578', 'G02.640.249', 'G02.723.661'], ['A11.733', 'A15.382.680'], ['G05.365.590.762', 'G05.558.800'], ['A10.549.700', 'A15.382.520.604.700'], ['D23.946.896']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Wounding-Induced Stomatal Closure Requires Jasmonate-Mediated Activation of GORK K+,"Guard cells integrate various hormone signals and environmental cues to balance plant gas exchange and transpiration. The wounding-associated hormone jasmonic acid (JA) and the drought hormone abscisic acid (ABA) both trigger stomatal closure. In contrast to ABA however, the molecular mechanisms of JA-induced stomatal closure have remained largely elusive. Here, we identify a fast signaling pathway for JA targeting the K+ efflux channel GORK. Wounding triggers both local and systemic stomatal closure by activation of the JA signaling cascade followed by GORK phosphorylation and activation through CBL1-CIPK5 Ca2+ sensor-kinase complexes. GORK activation strictly depends on plasma membrane targeting and Ca2+ binding of CBL1-CIPK5 complexes. Accordingly, in gork, cbl1, and cipk5 mutants, JA-induced stomatal closure is specifically abolished. The ABA-coreceptor ABI2 counteracts CBL1-CIPK5-dependent GORK activation. Hence, JA-induced Ca2+ signaling in response to biotic stress converges with the ABA-mediated drought stress pathway to facilitate GORK-mediated stomatal closure upon wounding.","['Abscisic Acid', 'Arabidopsis', 'Arabidopsis Proteins', 'Phosphorylation', 'Plant Stomata', 'Potassium Channels', 'Signal Transduction']",30528785,"[['D02.241.223.268.034', 'D02.455.326.271.665.202.061', 'D02.455.426.392.368.367.379.249.024', 'D02.455.849.131.061', 'D02.455.849.765.521.500'], ['B01.650.940.800.575.912.250.157.100'], ['D12.776.765.149'], ['G02.111.665', 'G02.607.780', 'G03.796'], ['A18.024.750.650', 'A18.024.812.650'], ['D12.776.157.530.400.600', 'D12.776.543.550.450.750', 'D12.776.543.585.400.750'], ['G02.111.820', 'G04.835']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Atm-, p53-, and Gadd45a-deficient mice show an increased frequency of homologous recombination at different stages during development.","Atm, p53, and Gadd45a form part of a DNA-damage cellular response pathway; the absence of any one of these components results in increased genomic instability. We conducted an in vivo examination of the frequency of spontaneous homologous recombination in Atm-, p53-, or Gadd45a-deficient mice. In the absence of p53, we observed the greatest increase in events, a lesser increase in the absence of Atm, and only a modest increase in the absence of Gadd45a. The striking observation was the difference in the time at which the spontaneous events occurred in atm and trp53 mutant mice. The frequency of homologous recombination in atm mutant mice was increased later during development. In contrast, p53 appears to have a role in suppressing homologous recombination early during development, when p53 is known to spontaneously promote p21 activity. The timing of the increased spontaneous recombination was similar in the Gadd45a- and p53-deficient mice. This temporal resolution suggests that Atm and p53 can act to maintain genomic integrity by different mechanisms in certain in vivo contexts.","['Animals', 'Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins', 'Cell Cycle Proteins', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Eye Color', 'Female', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mutation', 'Nuclear Proteins', 'Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases', 'Recombination, Genetic', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",14500365,"[['B01.050'], ['D08.811.913.696.620.682.700.097', 'D12.776.157.687.125', 'D12.776.660.720.125'], ['D12.776.167'], ['D12.776.260'], ['G14.340', 'G16.690.360'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500'], ['B01.050.050.199.520.520.420', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500.400.420'], ['G05.365.590'], ['D12.776.660'], ['D08.811.913.696.620.682.700'], ['G05.728'], ['D12.776.157.687.650', 'D12.776.260.820', 'D12.776.624.776.775', 'D12.776.660.720.650', 'D12.776.744.845'], ['D12.776.624.776']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Highly multiplexed antibody suspension bead arrays for plasma protein profiling.,"Alongside the increasing availability of affinity reagents, antibody microarrays have become a powerful tool to screen for target proteins in complex samples. Applying directly labeled samples onto arrays instead of using sandwich assays offers an approach to facilitate a systematic, high-throughput, and flexible exploration of protein profiles in body fluids such as serum or plasma. As an alternative to planar arrays, a system based on color-coded beads for the creation of antibody arrays in suspension has become available to offer a microtiter plate-based option for screening larger number of samples with variable sets of capture reagents. A procedure was established for analyzing biotinylated samples without the necessity to remove excess labeling substance. We have shown that this assay system allows detecting proteins down into lower pico-molar and higher pg/ml levels with dynamic ranges over three orders of magnitude. Presently, this workflow enables the profiling of 384 samples for up to 384 proteins per assay.","['Antibodies, Immobilized', 'Biotinylation', 'Blood Proteins', 'Humans', 'Protein Array Analysis']",23765623,"[['D12.776.124.486.485.114.207', 'D12.776.124.790.651.114.207', 'D12.776.377.715.548.114.207', 'D12.776.463.250'], ['E05.601.085', 'G02.111.109', 'G03.162'], ['D12.776.124'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E05.588.570.700', 'E05.601.680']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]']",0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Oral health status of vulnerable groups in a village of the Central Highlands, southern Vietnam.","OBJECTIVES: Oral health status of vulnerable people in developing countries tends to be given lower priority than other health issues. Consequently, few studies have examined the oral health status of the poor and minorities in developing countries. We aim to examine the dental caries and periodontal status, and explore the risk indicators of dental caries between two ethnic groups in rural villages in southern Vietnam.METHODS: We examined the caries status and its risk indicators of 150 participants (Co-Ho minority and Kinh majority) living in a hamlet of Dangphuong village in Vietnam. We also assessed periodontal status of the participants aged 14 and over by Community Periodontal Index.RESULTS: We first found that dental caries were highly prevalent among both the Co-Ho minority and Kinh majority groups. Second, the higher numbers of dental caries among children with primary teeth were associated with a higher frequency of consuming sweets. Third, most people (87%) aged 14 and over had periodontal problems. Finally, the Kinh majority tended to have more dental caries than Co-Ho among people aged less than 30.CONCLUSION: Oral health promotion should be considered as a part of the development programmes for vulnerable groups in Vietnam and other developing countries.","['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'DMF Index', 'Dental Caries', 'Developing Countries', 'Dietary Sucrose', 'Ethnic Groups', 'Feeding Behavior', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Oral Health', 'Periodontal Diseases', 'Periodontal Index', 'Prevalence', 'Risk Factors', 'Rural Health', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Vietnam', 'Vulnerable Populations']",16637908,"[['M01.060.057'], ['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['M01.060.116.100.080'], ['E05.318.308.980.438.300.350', 'E06.208.266', 'N05.715.360.300.800.438.300.340', 'N06.850.520.308.980.438.300.350', 'N06.890.160.100'], ['C07.793.720.210'], ['I01.615.500.300'], ['D09.301.831.250', 'D09.698.629.305.770.200', 'D09.947.500.250', 'D09.947.750.770.200', 'D27.720.372.300.353.609.750.250', 'G07.203.300.362.831.250', 'G07.203.300.514.500.400.700.750.250', 'J02.500.362.831.250', 'J02.500.514.500.400.700.750.250'], ['M01.686.754', 'N01.224.317'], ['F01.145.113.547', 'F01.145.407', 'G07.203.650.353'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['N01.400.535'], ['C07.465.714'], ['E05.318.308.980.438.300.725', 'E06.208.720', 'E06.721.658', 'N05.715.360.300.800.438.300.690', 'N06.850.520.308.980.438.300.725', 'N06.890.160.215'], ['E05.318.308.985.525.750', 'N01.224.935.597.750', 'N06.850.505.400.975.525.750', 'N06.850.520.308.985.525.750'], ['E05.318.740.600.800.725', 'N05.715.350.200.700', 'N05.715.360.750.625.700.700', 'N06.850.490.625.750', 'N06.850.520.830.600.800.725'], ['N01.400.548.750'], ['E05.318.308.980', 'N05.715.360.300.800', 'N06.850.520.308.980'], ['Z01.252.145.945'], ['M01.965']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Geographicals [Z]']",0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1
"Mangiferin Mitigates Gastric Ulcer in Ischemia/ Reperfused Rats: Involvement of PPAR-ã, NF-êB and Nrf2/HO-1 Signaling Pathways.","Mangiferin (MF), a xanthonoid from Mangifera indica, has been proved to have antisecretory and antioxidant gastroprotective effects against different gastric ulcer models; however, its molecular mechanism has not been previously elucidated. Therefore, the aim of this study was to test its modulatory effect on several signaling pathways using the ischemia/reperfusion model for the first time. Animals were treated with MF, omeprazole (OMP), and the vehicle. The mechanistic studies revealed that MF mediated its gastroprotective effect partly via inducing the expression of Nrf2, HO-1 and PPAR-ã along with downregulating that of NF-êB. Surprisingly, the effect of MF, especially the high dose, exceeded that mediated by OMP except for Nrf2. The molecular results were reflected on the biomarkers measured, where the antioxidant effect of MF was manifested by increasing total antioxidant capacity and glutathione, besides normalizing malondialdehyde level. Additionally, MF decreased the I/R-induced nitric oxide elevation, an effect that was better than that of OMP. In the serum, MF, dose dependently, enhanced endothelial nitric oxide synthase, while reduced the inducible isoform. Regarding the anti-inflammatory effect of MF, it reduced serum level of IL-1â and sE-selectin, effects that were mirrored on the tissue level of myeloperoxidase, the neutrophil infiltration marker. In addition, MF possessed an antiapoptotic character evidenced by elevating Bcl-2 level and reducing that of caspase-3 in a dose related order. As a conclusion, the intimated gastroprotective mechanisms of MF are mediated, partially, by modulation of oxidative stress, inflammation and apoptosis possibly via the Nrf2/HO-1, PPAR-ã/NF-êB signaling pathways.","['Animals', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Anti-Ulcer Agents', 'Antioxidants', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Heme Oxygenase-1', 'Male', 'Mangifera', 'NF-E2-Related Factor 2', 'NF-kappa B', 'Omeprazole', 'PPAR gamma', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar', 'Reperfusion Injury', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stomach Ulcer', 'Xanthones']",26196679,"[['B01.050'], ['D27.505.954.158'], ['D27.505.954.483.203'], ['D27.505.519.217', 'D27.505.696.706.125', 'D27.720.799.047'], ['G05.308'], ['D08.811.682.690.708.410.500'], ['B01.650.940.800.575.912.250.044.416'], ['D12.776.260.108.737', 'D12.776.930.127.737'], ['D05.500.672', 'D12.776.260.600', 'D12.776.660.600', 'D12.776.930.600'], ['D02.886.640.074.500', 'D03.383.725.024.500', 'D03.633.100.103.034.500'], ['D12.776.826.239.588'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700.900'], ['C14.907.725', 'C23.550.767.877'], ['G02.111.820', 'G04.835'], ['C06.405.469.275.800.849', 'C06.405.748.586.849'], ['D03.633.300.953.852']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Diseases [C]']",0,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Stereodynamics of tetramezine.,"The antidepressant drug tetramezine [1,2-bis-(3,3-dimethyldiaziridin-1-yl)ethane] consists of two bridged diaziridine moieties with four stereogenic nitrogen centers, which are stereolabile and, therefore, are prone to interconversion. The adjacent substituents at the nitrogen atoms of the diaziridines moieties exist only in an antiperiplanar conformation, which results in a coupled interconversion. Therefore, three stereoisomers exist (meso form and two enantiomeric forms), which epimerize when the diaziridine moieties are regarded as stereogenic units due to the coupled interconversion. Here, we have investigated the epimerization between the meso and enantiomeric forms by dynamic gas chromatography. Temperature-dependent measurements were performed, and reaction rate constants were determined using the unified equation of chromatography implemented in the software DCXplorer. The activation barriers of the epimerization were found to be ÄG(?) = 100.7 kJ mol(-1) at 25°C and ÄG(?) = 104.5 kJ mol(-1) at 37°C, respectively. The activation enthalpy and entropy were determined to be ÄH(?) = 70.3 ± 0.4 kJ mol(-1) and ÄS(?) = -102 ± 2 J mol(-1) K(-1) .","['Algorithms', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Aziridines', 'Chromatography, Gas', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Stereoisomerism', 'Thermodynamics']",20845424,"[['G17.035', 'L01.224.050'], ['D27.505.954.427.700.122'], ['D03.383.097.217'], ['E05.196.181.349'], ['G02.111.570.820'], ['G02.607.445.682'], ['G01.906']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
Physical activity and ischaemic heart disease in middle-aged British men.,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the relation between reported physical activity and the risk of heart attacks in middle aged British men.DESIGN: Prospective study of middle-aged men followed for a period of eight years (The British Regional Heart Study).SETTING: One general practice in each of 24 British towns.PARTICIPANTS: 7735 men aged 40-59 years at initial examination.END POINT: Heart attacks (non-fatal and fatal).MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: During the follow up period of eight years 488 men suffered at least one major heart attack. A physical activity score used was developed and validated against heart rate and lung function (FEV1) in men without evidence of ischaemic heart disease. Risk of heart attack decreased significantly with increasing physical activity; the groups reporting moderate and moderately vigorous activity experienced less than half the rate seen in inactive men. The benefits of physical activity were seen most consistently in men without preexisting ischaemic heart disease and up to levels of moderately vigorous activity. Vigorously active men had higher rates of heart attack than men with moderate or moderately vigorous activity. The relation between physical activity and the risk of heart attack seemed to be independent of other cardiovascular risk factors. Men with symptomatic ischaemic heart disease showed a reduction in the rate of heart attack at light or moderate levels of physical activity, beyond which the risk of heart attack increased. Men with asymptomatic ischaemic heart disease showed an increasing risk of heart attack with increasing levels of physical activity, but with a progressive decrease in case fatality. Overall, men who engaged in vigorous (sporting) activity of any frequency had significantly lower rates of heart attack than men who reported no sporting activity. However, when all men reporting regular sporting activity at least once a month were excluded from analysis, there remained a strong inverse relation between physical activity and the risk of heart attack in men without pre-existing ischaemic heart disease.CONCLUSION: This study suggests that the overall level of physical activity is an important independent protective factor in ischaemic heart disease and that vigorous (sporting) exercise, although beneficial in its own right, is not essential in order to obtain such an effect.","['Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Coronary Disease', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Forced Expiratory Volume', 'Heart Rate', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Physical Exertion', 'Prospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Sports', 'United Kingdom']",1747302,"[['M01.060.116'], ['N05.715.350.075', 'N06.850.490.250'], ['C14.280.647.250', 'C14.907.585.250'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.249', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.350', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.350'], ['E01.370.386.700.660.230', 'G09.772.650.430'], ['E01.370.600.875.500', 'G09.330.380.500'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['C14.280.647.500', 'C14.907.585.500', 'C23.550.513.355.750', 'C23.550.717.489.750'], ['G11.427.683'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.625', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.650', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.650'], ['E05.318.740.600.800.725', 'N05.715.350.200.700', 'N05.715.360.750.625.700.700', 'N06.850.490.625.750', 'N06.850.520.830.600.800.725'], ['I03.450.642.845'], ['Z01.542.363']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Geographicals [Z]']",0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1
Allopurinol Administration for the Prevention of Contrast-Induced Nephropathy: A Network Meta-analysis With Trial Sequential Analysis.,"Contrast-induced nephropathy represents a major source of morbidity in patients undergoing coronary angiography. Various preventive measures have been proposed, although the optimal one remains still unknown. The aim of the present meta-analysis is to accumulate current literature knowledge and evaluate the renoprotective effects of allopurinol administration before contrast medium exposure. To achieve this, MEDLINE, Scopus, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Clinicaltrials.gov, and Google Scholar databases were searched from inception to November 8, 2018. Statistical meta-analysis was conducted with Review Manager 5.3, TSA 0.9.5.5 and R-3.4.3. Six studies were included with a total of 918 patients. Quantitative synthesis revealed that allopurinol leads to significantly reduced incidence of contrast-induced nephropathy compared with hydration alone [odds ratio: 0.29, 95% confidence interval: (0.09-0.90)]. Trial sequential analysis suggested that Z-curve crossed the O'Brien-Fleming significance boundaries, although required information size was not reached. Network meta-analysis indicated that allopurinol had the highest probability (81.2%) to rank as the most effective intervention compared with hydration and N-acetyl cysteine; however, significant overlap with the rest treatments was noted. In conclusion, the present meta-analysis suggests that allopurinol may represent a promising measure for the prevention of acute kidney injury after coronary angiography. Future large-scale randomized controlled trials should verify this finding, while combinations of allopurinol with other novel interventions should be evaluated to define the most effective strategy to be implemented in the clinical setting.","['Acute Kidney Injury', 'Allopurinol', 'Contrast Media', 'Cytoprotection', 'Fluid Therapy', 'Gout Suppressants', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Kidney', 'Network Meta-Analysis', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Risk Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']",30829731,"[['C12.777.419.780.050', 'C13.351.968.419.780.050'], ['D03.633.100.759.160'], ['D27.505.259.500', 'D27.720.259'], ['G07.690.773.500'], ['E02.319.360'], ['D27.505.954.329.337'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E05.318.308.985.525.375', 'N01.224.935.597.500', 'N06.850.505.400.975.525.375', 'N06.850.520.308.985.525.375'], ['A05.810.453'], ['E05.318.370.500.500', 'E05.581.500.501.500', 'N05.715.360.325.515.500', 'N06.850.520.445.500.500'], ['E05.318.372.250.250.365.500', 'N05.715.360.330.250.250.365.500', 'N06.850.520.450.250.250.365.500'], ['E05.318.740.600.800.725', 'N05.715.350.200.700', 'N05.715.360.750.625.700.700', 'N06.850.490.625.750', 'N06.850.520.830.600.800.725'], ['E01.789.800', 'N04.761.559.590.800', 'N05.715.360.575.575.800']]","['Diseases [C]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
An EORTC international multicenter randomized trial (EORTC number 19923) comparing two dosages of liposomal amphotericin B for treatment of invasive aspergillosis.,"This is the first completed prospective randomized clinical efficacy trial of antifungals in the treatment of invasive aspergillosis (IA) and the first to compare the clinical efficacy of two dosages of liposomal amphotericin B (L-AmB) for IA in neutropenic patients with cancer or those undergoing bone marrow transplantation. Eighty-seven of 120 patients were eligible and evaluable. Clinical responses were documented for 26 (64%) of 41 patients receiving 1 mg/(kg.d) (L-AmB-1) and 22 (48%) of 46 receiving 4 mg/(kg.d) (L-AmB-4). Radiologic response rates were similar: 24 (58%) of the L-AmB-1 recipients and 24(52%) of the L-AmB-4 recipients. The six-month survival rates were 43% (L-AmB-1) and 37% (L-AmB-4). These differences were not significant. The numbers of deaths directly due to IA at 6 months were similar: 9 (22%) of 41 L-AmB-1 recipients and 9 (20%) of 46 L-AmB-4 recipients. No other variable independently influenced survival, apart from central nervous system IA. L-AmB is effective in treating approximately 50%-60% of patients who have IA. A 1-mg/(kg.d) dosage is as effective as a 4-mg/(kg.d) dosage, and no advantages to use of the higher, more expensive, dosage has been observed.","['Adult', 'Aged', 'Amphotericin B', 'Antifungal Agents', 'Aspergillosis', 'Drug Carriers', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Liposomes', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome']",9868651,"[['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['D02.540.576.500.500'], ['D27.505.954.122.136'], ['C01.150.703.080'], ['D26.255.260', 'E02.319.300.380'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D25.479.517', 'D26.255.260.517', 'J01.637.051.479.517', 'J01.637.087.500.517'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.625', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.650', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.650'], ['E05.318.740.998', 'N05.715.360.750.795', 'N06.850.520.830.998'], ['E01.789.800', 'N04.761.559.590.800', 'N05.715.360.575.575.800']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]', 'Health Care [N]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0
Business oriented EU human cell and tissue product legislation will adversely impact Member States' health care systems.,"The transplantation of conventional human cell and tissue grafts, such as heart valve replacements and skin for severely burnt patients, has saved many lives over the last decades. The late eighties saw the emergence of tissue engineering with the focus on the development of biological substitutes that restore or improve tissue function. In the nineties, at the height of the tissue engineering hype, industry incited policymakers to create a European regulatory environment, which would facilitate the emergence of a strong single market for tissue engineered products and their starting materials (human cells and tissues). In this paper we analyze the elaboration process of this new European Union (EU) human cell and tissue product regulatory regime-i.e. the EU Cell and Tissue Directives (EUCTDs) and the Advanced Therapy Medicinal Product (ATMP) Regulation and evaluate its impact on Member States' health care systems. We demonstrate that the successful lobbying on key areas of regulatory and policy processes by industry, in congruence with Europe's risk aversion and urge to promote growth and jobs, led to excessively business oriented legislation. Expensive industry oriented requirements were introduced and contentious social and ethical issues were excluded. We found indications that this new EU safety and health legislation will adversely impact Member States' health care systems; since 30 December 2012 (the end of the ATMP transitional period) there is a clear threat to the sustainability of some lifesaving and established ATMPs that were provided by public health institutions and small and medium-sized enterprises under the frame of the EUCTDs. In the light of the current economic crisis it is not clear how social security systems will cope with the inflation of costs associated with this new regulatory regime and how priorities will be set with regard to reimbursement decisions. We argue that the ATMP Regulation should urgently be revised to focus on delivering affordable therapies to all who are in need of them and this without necessarily going to the market. The most rapid and elegant way to achieve this would be for the European Commission to publish an interpretative document on ""placing on the market of ATMPs,"" which keeps tailor-made and niche ATMPs outside of the scope of the medicinal product regulation.","['Cell Transplantation', 'Commerce', 'Delivery of Health Care', 'Drug Industry', 'European Union', 'Humans', 'Legislation as Topic', 'Policy', 'Transplants']",24052113,"[['E02.095.147.500', 'E04.936.225'], ['J01.219'], ['N04.590.374', 'N05.300'], ['J01.576.655.750'], ['I01.615.500.475'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['N03.706.615'], ['I01.655', 'N03.623'], ['A01.941']]","['Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0
Interactions between rat prolactin gene promoter and enhancer regions in mammosomatotrope and lactotrope cell lines.,"Although both promoter and enhancer sequences of the PRL gene 5'-flanking DNA are required for cell-specific, high level expression in transgenic animals, reports of the relative contributions of these elements determined in transient transfection experiments have varied. In this study we examined the transcriptional activities of proximal promoter (-422/+33) and distal enhancer (-1956/-1530) sequences of the rat (r) PRL gene by transient transfection of hybrid genes containing these sequences into two rat pituitary cell lines, GC and 235-1. These cell lines exhibit characteristics either of mammosomatotropes, which express both PRL and the evolutionarily related GH gene (GC), or lactotropes, which express only PRL (235-1). As lactotropes are thought to differentiate from a mammosomatotrope precursor cell, comparisons between these cell lines provide the opportunity to examine the mechanisms that activate PRL and GH genes during development. We show that the relative contributions of promoter and enhancer elements differ between GC and 235-1 cells. Although maximal enhancer-driven activity was similar between these cell lines, promoter sequences were more active in GC (5-10% maximal) than 235-1 cells (1-2% maximal). However, no apparent differences in factor binding to the rPRL promoter region could be correlated with differences in activity, suggesting that differential factor modification, rather than different factors, is involved. As the rGH promoter exhibited a similar pattern of activity in these cell lines, these observations suggest that promoter as well as enhancer elements contribute to the cell specificity of PRL and GH gene expression.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Animals', 'DNA, Neoplasm', 'Enhancer Elements, Genetic', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Growth Hormone', 'Pituitary Neoplasms', 'Prolactin', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Rats', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1791833,"[['B01.050'], ['D13.444.308.425'], ['G02.111.570.080.689.330', 'G05.360.080.689.330', 'G05.360.340.024.340.137.750.249'], ['G05.308.370'], ['D06.472.699.631.525.425', 'D12.644.548.691.525.425'], ['C04.588.322.609', 'C04.588.614.250.195.885.500.600', 'C10.228.140.211.885.500.600', 'C10.228.140.617.477.600', 'C10.228.140.617.738.675', 'C10.551.240.250.700.500.500', 'C19.344.609', 'C19.700.734'], ['D06.472.699.322.576.773', 'D06.472.699.631.525.525', 'D12.644.548.691.525.525'], ['G02.111.570.080.689.675', 'G05.360.080.689.675', 'G05.360.340.024.340.137.750.680'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700'], ['E05.393.350.810', 'G05.728.860'], ['A11.251.860']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Sexual Scripts and Criminal Statutes: Gender Restrictions, Spousal Allowances, and Victim Accountability After Rape Law Reform.","The author provides a mixed-methods assessment of U.S. rape statutes to assess progress in reform. Contemporary statutes offer restrictive frameworks for distinguishing criminal from noncriminal sexual violence, many of which are grounded in gendered and heterosexist assumptions. Fourteen states retain gender restrictions in rape statutes. Twenty maintain marital distinctions that limit accountability for spousal rape. Furthermore, whereas explicit resistance requirements have been eliminated nationwide, implicit resistance expectations manifest through emphasis on physical force and involuntary intoxication. Analyses conclude with recommendations for further legal reform and a discussion of the potential for legislation to affect broader social perceptions of rape.","['Crime', 'Crime Victims', 'Criminal Law', 'History, 20th Century', 'History, 21st Century', 'Humans', 'Rape', 'Sexual Behavior', 'Social Perception', 'Social Responsibility', 'United States']",29332509,"[['I01.198.240', 'I01.880.735.191'], ['M01.135'], ['I01.198.290', 'I01.880.604.583.100'], ['K01.400.504.968'], ['K01.400.504.984'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['I01.198.240.748.640', 'I01.198.240.856.744', 'I01.880.735.900.772'], ['F01.145.802'], ['F02.463.593.752'], ['F01.829.500.760', 'K01.752.566.869'], ['Z01.107.567.875']]","['Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Humanities [K]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Geographicals [Z]']",0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1
Diagnostic value of symptom screening for pulmonary tuberculosis in China.,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the diagnostic value of symptom screening for tuberculosis (TB) case finding defined in National Tuberculosis Control Program in China (China NTP) among elderly people(?65 years) and younger people(<65 years).METHODS: We made a secondary analysis in a population-based TB prevalence survey in China in 2010. Questionnaire including information for cough and haemoptysis was completed by face to face interview, and then chest radiography was conducted in all eligible participants. Sputum smear and culture were followed for all TB suspects. We calculated the odds ratios (OR), sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV) and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of using different symptoms for screening to detect bacteriologically positive TB in subpopulations stratified by age 65, to evaluate the performance of symptom screening for TB.FINDINGS: Of 315 newly diagnosed bacteriologically positive TB, 131 patients (41.59%) were elderly, and 48.57% of TB patients were asymptomatic. Nearly 50% patients did not present cough of any duration, and less than half present cough more than 2 weeks, a defined suspected symptom in China NTP. Cough of any duration was reported more in patients aged under 65 than those in elderly, especially for the acute cough (9.78% vs 6.87%). Those symptoms defined by China NTP were reported by less than half participants in two subpopulations. Acute cough (<2 weeks) was an independent predictor of TB in people aged under 65 (adjusted OR: 3.3, 95% CI: 2.0-5.5), but not in those aged 65 and above (adjusted OR: 1.4, 95% CI: 0.7-2.9). The specificity for each symptom was significantly higher in participants aged under 65 (P<0.01), and sensitivities of most symptoms were significantly higher among elderly (P<0.05 or P<0.01). When compared with cough for 2 weeks and more, using cough of any duration for symptom screening increased the sensitivity from 42.9% to 51. % for all participants, and the AUC increased from 0.70 to 0.74 for participants aged under 65 without significant difference.CONCLUSIONS: There is a high percent of asymptomatic TB patients, and those symptoms adopted in China NTP for screening is poorly predictive for TB. The presence of TB symptoms, the sensitivities and specificities of symptoms for TB were distinct between two subpopulations cut by age 65, implying different case finding strategies should be established for them. The current case finding strategy should be improved, and further studies should be done to evaluate the performance and cost-effectiveness of different symptom screening strategy.","['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mass Screening', 'Middle Aged', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prevalence', 'Radiography, Thoracic', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sputum', 'Tuberculosis, Pulmonary']",26001190,"[['M01.060.057'], ['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['M01.060.116.100.080'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E01.370.500', 'E05.318.308.980.438.580', 'N02.421.726.233.443', 'N05.715.360.300.800.438.500', 'N06.850.520.308.980.438.580', 'N06.850.780.500'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['E05.318.370.800.650', 'N05.715.360.325.700.640', 'N06.850.520.445.800.650'], ['E05.318.308.985.525.750', 'N01.224.935.597.750', 'N06.850.505.400.975.525.750', 'N06.850.520.308.985.525.750'], ['E01.370.350.700.730'], ['E05.318.370.800', 'E05.318.740.872', 'G17.800', 'N05.715.360.325.700', 'N05.715.360.750.725', 'N06.850.520.445.800', 'N06.850.520.830.872'], ['A12.200.808'], ['C01.150.252.410.040.552.846.899', 'C01.748.939', 'C08.381.922', 'C08.730.939']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Diseases [C]']",1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
Genetic diversities of cytochrome B in Xinjiang Uyghur unveiled its origin and migration history.,"BACKGROUND: Uyghurs are one of the many populations of Central Eurasia that is considered to be genetically related to Eastern and Western Eurasian populations. However, there are some different opinions on the relative importance of the degree of Eastern and Western Eurasian genetic influence. In addition, the genetic diversity of the Uyghur in different geographic locations has not been clearly studied.RESULTS: In this study, we are the first to report on the DNA polymorphism of cytochrome B in the Uyghur population located in Xinjiang in northwest China. We observed a total of 102 mutant sites in the 240 samples that were studied. The average number of mutated nucleotides in the samples was 5.126. A total of 93 different haplotypes were observed. The gene diversity and discrimination power were 0.9480 and 0.9440, respectively. There were founder and bottleneck haplotypes observed in Xinjiang Uyghurs. Xinjiang Uyghurs are more genetically related to Chinese population in genetics than to Caucasians. Moreover, there was genetic diversity between Uyghurs from the southern and northern regions. There was significance in genetic distance between the southern Xinjiang Uyghurs and Chinese population, but not between the northern Xinjiang Uyghurs and Chinese. The European vs. East Asian contribution to the ten regional Uyghur groups varies among the groups and the European contribution to the Uyghur increases from north to south geographically.CONCLUSION: This study is the first report on DNA polymorphisms of cytochrome B in the Uyghur population. The study also further confirms that there are significant genetic differences among the Uyghurs in different geographical locations.","['Asian Continental Ancestry Group', 'China', 'Cytochromes b', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genotype', 'Haplotypes', 'History, Ancient', 'Human Migration', 'Humans', 'Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA']",24103151,"[['M01.686.508.200'], ['Z01.252.474.164'], ['D08.244.187.249', 'D12.776.422.220.187.249'], ['G05.365'], ['G05.380'], ['G05.380.360'], ['K01.400.470'], ['I01.240.600.525', 'N01.224.625.525', 'N06.850.505.400.700.525'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['G05.365.795'], ['E05.393.760.700']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Humanities [K]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1
"[Prevalence of iron deficiency anemia in a group of pre-school and school children, living in conditions of poverty].","Iron deficiency is common during the first years of life. Yet, there is a paucity of data on scholar children. Our main objective was to estimate the prevalence of ferropenic anemia in children 3 to 12 years of age living under conditions of poverty. A total of 323 children were included, 171 attended to a day care institution (group A) and 152 were from the same community but not attended in the day care institution (group B). Hemoglobin (Hb), medium corpuscular volume (MCV) and serum ferritin (SF) were measured in all children. In those with Hb < or = 11 g/dl and/or MCV < or = 73 fl and/or SF < or = 15 microg/l, transferrin saturation (TS) and soluble transferrin receptors (sTR) were also measured. Iron deficiency was defined as SF < or = 15 mg/l and ferropenic anemia was defined as Hb < or = 11 g/dl or MCV < or = 73 fl with sTR > or = 38 mmol/l and SF < or = 10 microg/l or TS < or = 10%. There were no differences between the groups regarding age, weight, height, education, gender and housing conditions. Mean hemoglobin level was 12.6 g/dl (group A: 12.4 g/dl vs. group B: 12.7 g/dl; p=0.012), and mean SF was 45 mg/l, without significant differences between groups. Prevalence of iron deficiency anemia was 2.5% (8/323) and iron deficiency was 4.4% (14/317), without significant differences between groups. These results persisted after controlling for confounding variables. In this group of children living under conditions of poverty in Argentina, iron deficiency anemia was uncommon.

Is an antiemetic prophylactic treatment needed for patients submitted to consecutive days of 5-fluorouracil? An observational study.,"AIMS AND BACKGROUND: The necessity of an antiemetic prophylaxis in patients treated with chemotherapy of low emetogenic potential, such as 5-fluorouracil +/- folinic acid fractionated over several consecutive days, is controversial. The aim of the study was to evaluate the therapeutic behavior of oncologists on this issue.METHODS: All consecutive in and out patients who started chemotherapy in 33 Italian oncological departments from June 24 to July 6,1996, were studied. The antiemetic prescription pattern and its effectiveness, in patients submitted to 5-fluorouracil +/- folinic acid were evaluated.RESULTS: Of the 1956 patients submitted to cancer chemotherapy, 259 patients received 5-fluorouracil +/- folinic acid. Of these, 186 patients were treated for 5 consecutive days, 47 for 4 days, 20 for 3 days and 6 for 2 days. A total of 219 (84.5%) received an antiemetic prophylaxis: 43.4% a 5-HT3 antagonist +/- steroids, 37.5% an antidopaminergic drug, 10.9% a steroid +/- antidopaminergic drug, and 8.2% other drugs. Only 40 patients (15.5%) did not receive an antiemetic prophylaxis. Overall complete protection from vomiting/nausea was 225/259 (86.9%)/163/259 (62.9%). The complete protection from vomiting/nausea during the 5 days in the 186 patients was not significantly different among patients receiving or not an antiemetic prophylaxis (88.1%/64.9% vs 88.9%/55.6%). At unifactorial analysis, the previous experience of vomiting/nausea caused by chemotherapy was found to be a significant prognostic factor. In fact, overall complete protection from vomiting/nausea was significantly inferior in patients who had previous experience of vomiting/nausea (65.1%/35.0%) with respect to those who did not (91.2%/75.4%, P < 0.001/ > 0.001, respectively).CONCLUSIONS: The study showed that in clinical practice patients submitted to 5-fluorouracil +/- folinic acid obtained a similar high protection from vomiting and nausea regardless of whether or not antiemetic prophylaxis was given. It would be therefore reasonable not to treat patients undergoing such chemotherapy, whereas patients with previous experience of vomiting/nausea caused by chemotherapy should be given an antiemetic prophylaxis.","['Aged', 'Antiemetics', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Drug Prescriptions', 'Female', 'Fluorouracil', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Italy', 'Leucovorin', 'Male', 'Medical Oncology', 'Middle Aged', 'Outcome and Process Assessment, Health Care', ""Practice Patterns, Physicians'"", 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Vomiting']",11989589,"[['M01.060.116.100'], ['D27.505.696.663.050.030', 'D27.505.954.427.095', 'D27.505.954.483.200'], ['D27.505.519.186.144', 'D27.505.954.248.144', 'D27.888.569.042.030'], ['E02.183.750.500', 'E02.319.077.500', 'E02.319.310.037'], ['E02.319.283'], ['E02.319.307', 'N02.421.668.778.500'], ['D03.383.742.698.875.404'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E05.318.308.985.525.375', 'N01.224.935.597.500', 'N06.850.505.400.975.525.375', 'N06.850.520.308.985.525.375'], ['Z01.542.489'], ['D03.633.100.733.631.400.800.350.450', 'D08.211.840.300.500'], ['H02.403.429.515'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['N04.761.559', 'N05.715.360.575'], ['N04.590.374.577', 'N05.300.625'], ['E05.318.308.980', 'N05.715.360.300.800', 'N06.850.520.308.980'], ['C23.888.821.937']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]', 'Diseases [C]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1
Immunomodulatory properties of novel nucleotide oligomerization domain 2 (nod2) agonistic desmuramyldipeptides.,"There is a pressing need for the development of novel adjuvants for human use. The minimal bioactive structure of bacterial peptidoglycan (PGN), muramyldipeptide (MDP), and its derivative murabutide (MB) have long been known for their adjuvant activities. For this reason, a series of novel desmuramyldipeptides have been designed and synthesized as part of our search for therapeutically useful MDP analogues. Since nucleotide oligomerization domain 2 (Nod2) is a putative receptor for MDP, we used engineered HEK293 cells overexpressing Nod2 to screen and validate our compounds for their Nod2-agonist activity. Their immunomodulatory properties were subsequently assessed in vitro by evaluating their effect on proinflammatory cytokine production of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)/ionomycin-stimulated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Herein, we present novel desmuramyldipeptides, the most active of them possessing immunoenhancing properties as a result of their potent Nod2-agonistic effect.","['Acetylmuramyl-Alanyl-Isoglutamine', 'Cytokines', 'Dipeptides', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Design', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Hydrophobic and Hydrophilic Interactions', 'Immunologic Factors', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear', 'Nod2 Signaling Adaptor Protein', 'Time Factors']",22716113,"[['D09.067.550.050', 'D09.811.522.050', 'D12.644.233.050'], ['D12.644.276.374', 'D12.776.467.374', 'D23.529.374'], ['D12.644.456.345'], ['G07.690.773.875', 'G07.690.936.500'], ['E05.290.500', 'H01.158.703.007.338.500', 'H01.181.466.338.500'], ['A11.251.210.172.750', 'A11.436.334'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['G02.409'], ['D27.505.696.477'], ['A11.118.637.555', 'A15.145.229.637.555', 'A15.382.490.555'], ['D12.644.360.024.131.500', 'D12.644.360.024.313.500', 'D12.644.360.075.358.500', 'D12.644.360.539.500.500', 'D12.776.157.057.006.500', 'D12.776.157.057.078.500', 'D12.776.476.024.139.500', 'D12.776.476.024.391.500', 'D12.776.476.075.358.500'], ['G01.910.857']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Organisms [B]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
Carotid artery stenting in the first 100 consecutive patients: results and follow up.,"BACKGROUND: Carotid artery stenting is now used as an alternative to surgical endarterectomy. The availability of cerebral protection systems has expanded the area of application of this procedure.OBJECTIVE: To assess the feasibility, safety, and immediate and late clinical outcome in patients undergoing percutaneous carotid interventions.METHODS: Between January 1999 and December 2000, 100 consecutive patients with 102 carotid artery stenoses were treated (71 men, 29 women, mean (SD) age 67 (8) years): 49 had coronary artery disease, 28 had previous stroke or transient ischaemic attack (TIA). On the basis of the Mayo Clinic carotid endarterectomy risk scale, 73 patients were grade III-IV and 13 grade VI.RESULTS: Baseline diameter stenosis was 78.8 (10)%, with a mean lesion length of 12.6 (5.8) mm. Angiographic success was obtained in 99 lesions (97.0%) with a final diameter stenosis of 2.4 (3.5)%. Procedural success was obtained in 96 patients (96%). Selective cannulation of three carotid arteries was impossible owing to severe vessel tortuosity. Carotid stenting was performed in 97 of the treated lesions, and protection devices were used in 67 lesions. In-hospital complications occurred in seven patients (six TIA, one (category 1) minor stroke). No major stroke or death occurred. All patients were discharged from the hospital after an average of 2.5 days. At 12 (6.2) months of follow up restenosis occurred in three patients (3.4%) (one patient with carotid occlusion had TIA). Six patients had died: two from cerebrovascular events (5 and 11 months after the procedure) and four from cardiovascular causes.CONCLUSIONS: Carotid stenting appears feasible and safe, with few major complications. Long term follow up is affected by a high incidence of cardiovascular mortality.","['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Carotid Stenosis', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Ischemic Attack, Transient', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Recurrence', 'Stents']",12231597,"[['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['M01.060.116.100.080'], ['C10.228.140.300.200.360', 'C14.907.137.230', 'C14.907.253.123.360'], ['E05.318.372.550', 'E05.337.675', 'N05.715.360.330.550', 'N06.850.520.450.550'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.249', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.350', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.350'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C10.228.140.300.150.836', 'C14.907.253.092.836'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['C23.550.291.937'], ['E07.695.750']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]']",0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
Pyriform sinus malformations: a cadaveric representation.,"BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: The most important aspects in management of pyriform sinus malformations are awareness of the diagnosis, familiarity with the clinical manifestations, and complete surgical excision of the entire tract. Pyriform sinus anomalies are the least common branchial apparatus malformations and present anatomically as sinus tracts with or without cystic dilatation. The clinical presentations can include lateral neck mass, thyroid abscess, suppurative thyroiditis, retropharyngeal abscess, neonatal airway obstruction, and even carcinoma. Recurrent symptoms after surgery suggest incomplete identification and excision of the tract.METHODS: Cadaveric dissections were performed to show both the proposed embryologic course and clinical manifestations of third and fourth branchial apparatus pyriform sinus anomalies.RESULTS: Illustrations and digital camera images of the cadaveric models are presented to explain the course of pyriform sinus fistula tracts.CONCLUSIONS: The authors discuss 3 case presentations of pyriform sinus anomalies with emphasis on their proposed embryologic origin and anatomic basis for surgical management. Surgical excision is the mainstay of therapy. Understanding the embryologic basis for pyriform sinus malformations aids in recognition of the diagnosis despite the myriad of clinical presentations. Laryngoscopy with sinus cannulation facilitates removal of the entire sinus tract with preservation of the recurrent and superior laryngeal nerves.","['Abscess', 'Adolescent', 'Airway Obstruction', 'Branchial Region', 'Bronchial Neoplasms', 'Cadaver', 'Child', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hypopharynx', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Larynx', 'Male', 'Models, Anatomic', 'Pharyngeal Neoplasms', 'Retropharyngeal Abscess', 'Thyroiditis, Suppurative']",11877683,"[['C01.830.025', 'C23.550.470.756.100'], ['M01.060.057'], ['C08.618.846.185'], ['A16.142'], ['C04.588.894.797.520.109', 'C08.127.265', 'C08.785.520.100'], ['C23.550.260.224'], ['M01.060.406'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['A04.623.490', 'A14.724.490'], ['M01.060.703.520'], ['A04.329'], ['J01.897.280.500.545.129', 'L01.178.820.090.545.129'], ['C04.588.443.665.710', 'C07.550.745', 'C09.647.710', 'C09.775.549'], ['C01.748.561.625', 'C01.830.025.780', 'C07.550.781.625', 'C08.730.561.625', 'C09.775.649.625'], ['C01.830.840', 'C19.874.871.910']]","['Diseases [C]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]', 'Information Science [L]']",1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0
"Precipitation, stabilization and molecular modeling of ZnS nanoparticles in the presence of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide.","ZnS nanoparticles were precipitated in aqueous dispersions of cationic surfactant cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB). The sphere radii of ZnS nanoparticles calculated by using band-gap energies steeply decreased from 4.5 nm to 2.2 nm within CTAB concentrations of 0.4-1.5 mmol L(-1). Above the concentration of 1.5 mmol L(-1), the radii were stabilized at R=2.0 nm and increased up to R=2.5 nm after 24 h. The hydrodynamic diameters of CTAB-ZnS structures observed by the dynamic light scattering (DLS) method ranged from 130 nm to 23 nm depending on CTAB concentrations of 0.5-1.5 mmol L(-1). The complex structures were observed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). At the higher CTAB concentrations, ZnS nanoparticles were surrounded by CTA(+) bilayers forming positively charged micelles with the diameter of 10nm. The positive zeta-potentials of the micelles and their agglomerates were from 16 mV to 33 mV. Wurtzite and sphalerite nanoparticles with R=2.0 nm and 2.5 nm covered by CTA(+) were modeled with and without water. Calculated sublimation energies confirmed that a bilayer arrangement of CTA(+) on the ZnS nanoparticles was preferred to a monolayer.","['Cetrimonium', 'Cetrimonium Compounds', 'Chemical Precipitation', 'Light', 'Models, Molecular', 'Nanoparticles', 'Particle Size', 'Scattering, Radiation', 'Spectrophotometry, Ultraviolet', 'Surface Properties', 'Surface-Active Agents', 'Zinc Sulfate']",22520213,"[['D02.092.877.883.111.500', 'D02.675.276.190.500'], ['D02.092.877.883.111', 'D02.675.276.190'], ['E05.196.150', 'G02.159'], ['G01.358.500.505.650', 'G01.590.540', 'G01.750.250.650', 'G01.750.770.578'], ['E05.599.595'], ['J01.637.512.600'], ['G02.712'], ['E05.196.822', 'G01.867'], ['E05.196.712.726.802', 'E05.196.867.826.802'], ['G02.860'], ['D27.720.877'], ['D01.875.800.800.850.950', 'D01.975.987']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]']",0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
Survival and neurodevelopmental outcomes of preterm infants.,"Survival of preterm infants, which increased dramatically during the years after the introduction of neonatal intensive care, reached a plateau in the mid- to late 1990s. Neonatal morbidity, which increased initially, has decreased since 2000 and resulted in a decrease in the rates of cerebral palsy. Follow-up of preterm infants to early childhood and school age reveals higher rates of asthma, cerebral palsy, subnormal cognitive function, poorer academic achievement, and behavioral problems. Although many of the problems persist into adulthood, preterm survivors regard their overall health and quality of life similar to that of normal birth weight controls.","['Cerebral Palsy', 'Child', 'Child Development', 'Child, Preschool', 'Developmental Disabilities', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant Mortality', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Infant, Premature', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Analysis']",18185079,"[['C10.228.140.140.254'], ['M01.060.406'], ['F01.525.200', 'G07.345.374.750'], ['M01.060.406.448'], ['F03.625.421'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.703'], ['E05.318.308.985.550.475', 'N01.224.935.698.489', 'N06.850.505.400.975.550.475', 'N06.850.520.308.985.550.475'], ['M01.060.703.520'], ['M01.060.703.520.520'], ['E01.789'], ['E05.318.740.998', 'N05.715.360.750.795', 'N06.850.520.830.998']]","['Diseases [C]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]']",0,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
Choledochotomy and primary repair of extrahepatic biliary duct rupture in seven dogs and two cats.,"OBJECTIVE: To report clinical findings and outcome in dogs and cats undergoing choledochotomy or primary repair of extrahepatic biliary duct rupture.METHODS: Retrospective study of dogs (n=7) and cats (n=2) that had choledochotomy or primary bile duct repair.RESULTS: Extrahepatic biliary obstruction was confirmed at surgery in all cases. The underlying cause in four dogs and both cats was choledocholithiasis, two dogs had gall bladder mucocoeles with associated bile duct rupture, and one dog had inspissated bile obstructing the bile duct secondary to gall bladder carcinoid tumour. Three dogs and both cats had choledochotomies performed to relieve extrahepatic biliary obstruction, and four dogs with bile duct rupture underwent primary repair of the defect. One dog with a bile duct rupture was re-explored four days postoperatively and had suffered dehiscence of the repair; this rupture was re-repaired. All animals were discharged from the hospital, and did not have clinical recurrence of extrahepatic biliary obstruction.CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Choledochotomy and primary repair of extrahepatic biliary duct rupture were associated with low perioperative morbidity and no mortality in this small cohort of cases. These techniques are reasonable options either alone or in conjunction with other procedures when bile duct patency cannot be re-established by catheterisation or bile duct discontinuity exists.","['Animals', 'Bile Duct Diseases', 'Bile Ducts, Extrahepatic', 'Biliary Tract Surgical Procedures', 'Cat Diseases', 'Cats', 'Choledocholithiasis', 'Cholestasis, Extrahepatic', 'Dog Diseases', 'Dogs', 'Female', 'Gallbladder', 'Gallbladder Diseases', 'Male', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Rupture, Spontaneous', 'Treatment Outcome']",21143234,"[['B01.050'], ['C06.130.120'], ['A03.159.183.079'], ['E04.210.120'], ['C22.180'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.750.377.750.250.125'], ['C06.130.120.250.174', 'C06.130.409.267'], ['C06.130.120.135.150'], ['C22.268'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.750.250.216.200'], ['A03.159.439'], ['C06.130.564'], ['E05.318.372.500.500.500', 'E05.318.372.500.750.750', 'N05.715.360.330.500.500.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.825', 'N06.850.520.450.500.500.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.825'], ['C23.300.909'], ['E01.789.800', 'N04.761.559.590.800', 'N05.715.360.575.575.800']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]']",1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
Repeated whole cigarette smoke exposure alters cell differentiation and augments secretion of inflammatory mediators in air-liquid interface three-dimensional co-culture model of human bronchial tissue.,"In vitro models of human bronchial epithelium are useful for toxicological testing because of their resemblance to in vivo tissue. We constructed a model of human bronchial tissue which has a fibroblast layer embedded in a collagen matrix directly below a fully-differentiated epithelial cell layer. The model was applied to whole cigarette smoke (CS) exposure repeatedly from an air-liquid interface culture while bronchial epithelial cells were differentiating. The effects of CS exposure on differentiation were determined by histological and gene expression analyses on culture day 21. We found a decrease in ciliated cells and perturbation of goblet cell differentiation. We also analyzed the effects of CS exposure on the inflammatory response, and observed a significant increase in secretion of IL-8, GRO-á, IL-1â, and GM-CSF. Interestingly, secretion of these mediators was augmented with repetition of whole CS exposure. Our data demonstrate the usefulness of our bronchial tissue model for in vitro testing and the importance of exposure repetition in perturbing the differentiation and inflammation processes.","['Bronchi', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A1', 'Cytokines', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Fibroblasts', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'NF-kappa B', 'Smoke', 'Tissue Culture Techniques', 'Tobacco']",27596523,"[['A04.411.125'], ['G04.152'], ['E05.481.500.374'], ['D08.244.453.005.332', 'D08.244.453.100.500', 'D08.811.682.690.708.170.010.277', 'D08.811.682.690.708.170.020.500', 'D12.776.422.220.453.010.332', 'D12.776.422.220.453.100.500'], ['D12.644.276.374', 'D12.776.467.374', 'D23.529.374'], ['A11.436'], ['A11.329.228'], ['G05.297'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D05.500.672', 'D12.776.260.600', 'D12.776.660.600', 'D12.776.930.600'], ['D20.633.937'], ['E05.481.500.617'], ['B01.650.940.800.575.912.250.908.500.900']]","['Anatomy [A]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Cell transformation by v-Jun deactivates ERK MAP kinase signalling.,"Previous studies have shown that v-Jun accelerates G1 progression and enables cells to sustain S phase entry in the absence of serum growth factors. Since growth factor-dependent ERK MAP kinase signalling plays an important role in regulating the G1/S transition, we investigated whether aberrant ERK regulation might contribute to cell cycle deregulation by v-Jun. Contrary to expectation, we find that cells transformed by v-Jun exhibit a profound reduction in the basal level of active, dual-phosphorylated ERK. In addition, ERK becomes refractory to stimulation by a subset of agonists including serum, LPA, and EGF, but remains partially responsive to the phorbol ester, TPA. Biochemical analysis indicates that these defects are attributable to a combination of inefficient signal propagation between Ras and Raf within the ERK pathway and increased tonic deactivation by MAP kinase phosphatases. Taken together, these results demonstrate that cell transformation by v-Jun induces alterations in cell physiology which antagonize ERK signalling at multiple levels. The potential significance of this phenotype for oncogenesis by v-Jun is discussed.","['Animals', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Chick Embryo', 'Down-Regulation', 'Fibroblasts', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'MAP Kinase Kinase Kinase 1', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases', 'Oncogene Protein p65(gag-jun)', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases', 'Retroviridae', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",12226757,"[['B01.050'], ['E05.196.401.143', 'E05.301.300.096', 'E05.478.566.320.200', 'E05.601.262', 'E05.601.470.320.200'], ['G04.144.220', 'G04.161.750.500', 'G05.113', 'G07.345.249.410.750.500'], ['C04.697.098.500', 'C23.550.727.098.500'], ['A13.350.150', 'A16.331.200'], ['G02.111.240', 'G05.308.200', 'G07.690.773.937'], ['A11.329.228'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E05.478.566.350', 'E05.478.583.400', 'E05.601.470.350'], ['D08.811.913.696.620.682.700.559.100', 'D12.644.360.400.100', 'D12.776.476.400.100'], ['D08.811.913.696.620.682.700.567', 'D12.644.360.450', 'D12.776.476.450'], ['D12.776.602.500.500.320.700', 'D12.776.624.664.500.320.700', 'D12.776.624.664.520.750.320.700', 'D12.776.964.700.750.320.700', 'D12.776.964.775.350.320.700', 'D12.776.964.775.750.320.700'], ['G02.111.665', 'G02.607.780', 'G03.796'], ['D08.811.913.696.620.682.700'], ['B04.613.807', 'B04.820.650'], ['G02.111.820', 'G04.835'], ['D02.455.849.291.500.510.850'], ['A11.251.860']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Altered metabolic incorporation of fucose and leucine into PNS myelin of 25-week-old diabetic (C57BL/Ks [db/db]) mice: effects of untreated diabetes on nerve metabolism.,"Sciatic nerves of 25-week-old genetically diabetic (C57BL/Ks [db/db]) mice and their litter-mate controls were removed, and their metabolic incorporation of [3H]fucose and [14C]leucine into myelin was studied in vitro. Untreated diabetic animals showed significant increases (p less than 0.05) in the fucose/leucine incorporation into myelin when compared to values found for their litter-mates. These results correlated well with previous experiments performed on alloxan or streptozotocin-diabetic rats and thus show the in vitro incubation procedure to be a good indicator of altered metabolic conditions in peripheral nerves due to diabetes mellitus. The resulting ratio increases seen in diabetic animals is at variance with the decrease in ratios found in animals undergoing typical Wallerian degeneration. These results suggest that different metabolic processes operate in untreated diabetics than in normals or in those undergoing other degenerative nerve processes.","['Animals', 'Carbon Radioisotopes', 'Diabetes Mellitus, Experimental', 'Diabetic Neuropathies', 'Fucose', 'Leucine', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Mutant Strains', 'Myelin Proteins', 'Myelin Sheath', 'Sciatic Nerve', 'Tritium']",6888648,"[['B01.050'], ['D01.268.150.075.328', 'D01.496.123.328', 'D01.496.749.154'], ['C18.452.394.750.074', 'C19.246.240', 'E05.598.500.374'], ['C10.668.829.300', 'C19.246.099.937'], ['D09.254.488'], ['D12.125.070.637', 'D12.125.142.441'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500.550'], ['D12.776.543.620', 'D12.776.631.580'], ['A08.637.600.500', 'A08.637.800.500', 'A08.675.542.512.560', 'A08.800.800.690.500', 'A10.755.503', 'A11.284.149.165.600', 'A11.650.600.500', 'A11.650.800.500', 'A11.671.501.512.560', 'A11.671.514.553'], ['A08.800.800.720.450.760'], ['D01.268.406.875', 'D01.362.340.875', 'D01.496.749.925']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Insulin signaling in various equine tissues under basal conditions and acute stimulation by intravenously injected insulin.,"The aim of the study was to analyze key proteins of the equine insulin signaling cascade and their extent of phosphorylation in biopsies from muscle tissue (MT), liver tissue (LT), and nuchal AT, subcutaneous AT, and retroperitoneal adipose tissues. This was investigated under unstimulated (B1) and intravenously insulin stimulated (B2) conditions, which were achieved by injection of insulin (0.1 IU/kg bodyweight) and glucose (150 mg/kg bodyweight). Twelve warmblood horses aged 15 ± 6.8 yr (yr), weighing 559 ± 79 kg, and with a mean body condition score of 4.7 ± 1.5 were included in the study. Key proteins of the insulin signaling cascade were semiquantitatively determined using Western blotting. Furthermore, modulation of the cascade was assessed. The basal expression of the proteins was only slightly influenced during the experimental period. Insulin induced a high extent of phosphorylation of insulin receptor in LT (P < 0.01) but not in MT. Protein kinase B and mechanistic target of rapamycin expressed a higher extent of phosphorylation in all tissues in B2 biopsies. Adenosine monophosphate protein kinase, as a component related to insulin signaling, expressed enhanced phosphorylation in MT (P < 0.05) and adipose tissues (nuchal AT P < 0.05; SCAT P < 0.01; retroperitoneal adipose tissue P < 0.05), but not in LT at B2. Tissue-specific variations in the acute response of insulin signaling to intravenously injected insulin were observed. In conclusion, insulin sensitivity in healthy horses is based on a complex concerted action of different tissues by their variations in the molecular response to insulin.","['Adipose Tissue', 'Animals', 'Female', 'Horses', 'Injections, Intravenous', 'Insulin', 'Insulin Resistance', 'Liver', 'Male', 'Muscle, Skeletal', 'Phosphorylation', 'Receptor, Insulin', 'Signal Transduction']",28595108,"[['A10.165.114'], ['B01.050'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.984.235.472'], ['E02.319.267.082.750', 'E02.319.267.530.540'], ['D06.472.699.587.200.500.625', 'D12.644.548.586.200.500.625'], ['C18.452.394.968.500', 'G07.690.773.984.617'], ['A03.620'], ['A02.633.567', 'A10.690.552.500'], ['G02.111.665', 'G02.607.780', 'G03.796'], ['D08.811.913.696.620.682.725.400.200', 'D12.776.543.750.630.484', 'D12.776.543.750.750.580.300'], ['G02.111.820', 'G04.835']]","['Anatomy [A]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Influence of inflammation or disconnection from peripheral target tissue on the capsaicin sensitivity of rat dorsal root ganglion sensory neurones.,"Dorsal root ganglion (DRG) sensory neurones from adult rats are known to lose their capsaicin sensitivity in vitro if they are cultured without nerve growth factor (NGF). Here we show similar results following peripheral nerve transection in vivo, which deprives DRG sensory neurones of target-derived NGF. By measuring capsaicin-stimulated 45Ca uptake into DRG neurones which had been briefly cultured, capsaicin sensitivity was shown to decrease in neurones whose axons had been previously severed in vivo. Conversely, during experimental inflammation of the rat paw, there is an increase in the supply of NGF to neurones innervating the inflamed area. In this case, however, no significant increase in capsaicin sensitivity could be demonstrated in briefly cultured neurones which had previously innervated an inflamed limb. This suggests that expression of capsaicin sensitivity in DRG is maximal at levels of NGF found in normal animals.","['Animals', 'Biological Transport', 'Calcium', 'Capsaicin', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Denervation', 'Drug Resistance', 'Ganglia, Spinal', 'Inflammation', 'Ion Channel Gating', 'Ion Channels', 'Nerve Growth Factors', 'Neurons, Afferent', 'Peripheral Nerve Injuries', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Sciatic Nerve']",8834108,"[['B01.050'], ['G03.143'], ['D01.268.552.100', 'D01.552.539.288', 'D23.119.100'], ['D02.065.690.500', 'D02.455.326.271.690.222', 'D02.455.426.559.389.657.166.099', 'D03.132.760.200', 'D10.251.355.325.190'], ['A11.251'], ['E04.525.210'], ['G07.690.773.984'], ['A08.340.390.340', 'A08.800.350.340', 'A08.800.800.720.725.350'], ['C23.550.470'], ['G02.111.820.400', 'G04.835.400', 'G07.265.625'], ['D12.776.157.530.400', 'D12.776.543.550.450', 'D12.776.543.585.400'], ['D12.644.276.860', 'D12.776.467.860', 'D12.776.631.600', 'D23.529.850'], ['A08.675.650', 'A11.671.650'], ['C10.668.829.712', 'C10.900.575', 'C26.915.650'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700.750'], ['A08.800.800.720.450.760']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Diseases [C]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Polymerization properties of two normally circulating fibrinogens, HMW and LMW. Evidence that the COOH-terminal end of the a-chain is of importance for fibrin polymerization.","The plasma fibrinogen fractions HMW (mw 340,000) and LMW (mw 305,000) were prepared from purified (beta-alanine precipitated) fibrinogen by step-wise precipitation with ammonium sulfate. The thrombin clotting times were 14"" and 20"" respectively. The enzymatic phase of coagulation, measured as release of fibrinopeptide-A during incubation with thrombin, was found to be identical for HMW and LMW. Polymerization was studied by light scattering (at 605 nm) using preformed monomers (des-AA and des-AABB) prepared from HMW and LMW in the presence of 3.3 M urea by incubation with thrombin (100 NIH U/ml final conc.) and reptilase (1 U/ml final conc.). The HMW-monomers polymerised at a substantially higher rate than the corresponding LMW-monomers. Thus, the prolonged clotting time of LMW was explained by retarded polymerization. It is suggested that the -COOH terminal end of the a-chain, containing the molecular difference between HMW and LMW, is of importance for polymerization. Furthermore, the release of fibrinopeptide B (des-AABB-monomers) improved polymerization properties in HMW as well as in LMW, and all types of monomers polymerised more rapidly in the presence of Ca++.","['Fibrin', 'Fibrinogen', 'Fibrinopeptide A', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Light', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Molecular Weight', 'Scattering, Radiation', 'Thrombin Time']",4082102,"[['D12.776.124.270'], ['D12.776.124.050.250', 'D12.776.124.125.500', 'D12.776.811.300', 'D23.119.490'], ['D12.644.200', 'D12.776.124.125.515', 'D12.776.124.270.310', 'D12.776.811.300.310', 'D23.101.340', 'D23.119.500'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['G01.374.661', 'G02.111.490'], ['G01.358.500.505.650', 'G01.590.540', 'G01.750.250.650', 'G01.750.770.578'], ['D05'], ['G02.494'], ['E05.196.822', 'G01.867'], ['E01.370.225.625.115.870', 'E05.200.625.115.870', 'G09.188.840']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
[Molecular epidemiological study of human coronavirus OC43 in Shanghai from 2009-2016].,"Objective: To understand the epidemiological characteristics of Human coronavirus (HCoV), the patterns of emergence and circulation, and the genotype distribution of human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43) from November, 2009 to April, 2016 in Shanghai. Methods: A total of 6 059 respiratory specimens, including pharyngeal swab, sputum, nasopharyngeal aspirates and alveolar lavage fluid, as well as relative clinical data were collected from patients with acute respiratory infections from seven sentinel hospitals during November, 2009 to April, 2016 in Shanghai. Respiratory specimens were tested by RT-PCR with HCoV-conserved primers and subsequently genotyped by DNA sequencing. Using specific primers to amplify and sequence full-length Spike (S), RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RDRP) and nucleocapsid (N) gene from HCoV-OC43 positive samples. Further genotype and phylogenetic analysis of HCoV-OC43 were performed by conducting phylogenetic trees. Results: Among 6 059 patients, the total frequency of HCoV was 63 (1.04%), in which HCoV-OC43 was the most frequently detected species with 34 positive samples, followed by human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E) and human coronavirus HKU1 (HCoV-HKU1) with 18 and 10 positive sample respectively. However, other HCoV like human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle-East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV), were not been detected, which illustrated that HCoV-OC43 was the dominant subtype. The full-length of S, RDRP and N gene were obtained from 29 HCoV-OC43 positive samples. According to the sequence-analysis, 27 of which was genotype D, 2 of which was genotype B and others genotype, including genotype E, F and G, were not detected. The result indicated that the genotype D may be the dominant genotype. Further analysis of S protein that help HCoV-OC43 to entry host cell and stimulate the host immune system to produce neutralizing antibody found that two important functional domains in S protein, N-terminal domain (NTD) and receptor-binding domain (RBD) contained more amino acid substitution and positive selection sites, accompanied with amino acid insertion/deletion. 13 positive selection sites were all located in the NTD or RBD, 10 of which were located in the NTD and 3 in the RBD. Conclusion: Human coronavirus OC43 was the major circulation human coronaviurs in Shanghai from 2009 to 2016, in which genotype D was the dominant genotype. NTD and RBD regions of the S protein were hypervariable region during HCoV-OC43 evolution, and had amino acid substitutions as well as amino acid insertion/deletion.","['China', 'Coronavirus Infections', 'Coronavirus OC43, Human', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus', 'Phylogeny', 'Respiratory Tract Infections', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA']",29334709,"[['Z01.252.474.164'], ['C01.925.782.600.550.200'], ['B04.820.578.500.540.150.113.500.500'], ['E05.318.372.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500'], ['G05.380'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['B04.820.578.500.540.150.113.750'], ['G05.697', 'G16.075.605', 'L01.100.697'], ['C01.748', 'C08.730'], ['E05.393.760.700']]","['Geographicals [Z]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Information Science [L]']",0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,1
[Prevention of accidents caused by construction work].,"Descriptive data on occupational accidents and diseases in the field of construction and particularly among builders are reported. They derive from publications of the National Insurance Institute for Occupational Accidents (INAIL) and refer to the Italian and Umbrian situation. Data show that the number and the severity of the accidents in this field are of great concern. The characteristics of the building work in our areas are too peculiar as the work is carried out in small building sites and lasts for a short period of time; subcontracting and piecework are widely diffused; health surveillance is nearly absent. One must take into account all of these characteristics when prevention programs are to be planned. Intervention priority must be given to a) information on occupational risks of contractors and workers; b) first level prevention; c) control and inspection activity. In this respect the A.A. report the results of the watch activity in 703 erecting yards by one to health unit's Department for the health security, safety and welfare of persons at work (period May 1985 - May 1988).

Scatterer reconstruction and parametrization of homogeneous tissue for ultrasound image simulation.,"Numerical simulation of ultrasound images can facilitate the training of sonographers. A realistic appearance of simulated ultrasonic speckle is essential for a plausible ultrasound simulation. An efficient and realistic model for ultrasonic speckle is the convolution of the ultrasound point-spread function with a parametrized distribution of point scatterers. Nevertheless, for a given arbitrary tissue, such scatterer distributions that would generate a realistic image are not known a priori, and currently there is no principled method to extract such scatterer patterns for given target tissues to be simulated. In this paper we propose to solve the inverse problem, in which an underlying scatterer map for a given sample ultrasound image is estimated. From such scatterer maps, it is also shown that a parametrization distribution model can be built, using which other instances of the same tissue can be simulated by feeding into a standard speckle generation method. This enables us to synthesize images of different tissue types from actual ultrasound images to be used in simulations with arbitrary view angles and transducer settings. We show in numerical and physical tissue-mimicking phantoms and actual physical tissue that the appearance of the synthesized images closely match the real images.","['Computer Simulation', 'Image Processing, Computer-Assisted', 'Models, Biological', 'Phantoms, Imaging', 'Ultrasonography']",26737745,"[['L01.224.160'], ['L01.224.308'], ['E05.599.395'], ['E07.671'], ['E01.370.350.850']]","['Information Science [L]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
Quality of life after cerebrovascular stroke: a systematic study of patients' preferences for different functional outcomes.,"OBJECTIVES: To elicit valid quality of life estimates and the highest acceptable treatment risk of different outcomes after stroke. This is a prerequisite for rational medical decision-making, especially when considering treatments like thrombolysis.SUBJECTS: Healthy people, non-stroke medical patients and stroke survivors aged 20-84 years (n = 158)INTERVENTIONS: Subjects were interviewed by a physician using three different methods ('standard gamble', 'time trade-off' and 'direct scaling') supported by an interactive computer program.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: We measured utility, a numerical value ranging from 0.00 (death) to 1.00 (perfect health), representing the strength of the patient's preference for an outcome. When using the standard gamble method, risk is also introduced into the measurement.RESULTS: People's preferences for stroke outcomes varied widely, and the estimates were influenced by assessment method. We found that previous stroke, marital status and age were the only independent variables influencing the utility given. Subjects in our population over the age of 45 were very comparable to the real population at risk for acute stroke regarding these three variables, and they assigned a median utility of 0.91 (10th percentile, 0.65; 90th percentile, 0.99) to a minor stroke and 0.61 (10th percentile, 0.08; 90th percentile, 0.95) to a major stroke using the standard gamble method.CONCLUSIONS: Most people do not feel that suffering from stroke is an overwhelming catastrophe and they do not accept treatment options with very high risks.","['Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cerebrovascular Disorders', 'Decision Support Techniques', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Marital Status', 'Middle Aged', 'Quality of Life', 'Recurrence', 'Treatment Outcome']",10475999,"[['M01.060.116'], ['N05.715.350.075', 'N06.850.490.250'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['M01.060.116.100.080'], ['C10.228.140.300', 'C14.907.253'], ['E05.245', 'L01.313.500.750.190'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['F01.829.263.315.500', 'I01.240.361.500', 'I01.880.853.150.423.500', 'N01.224.361.500', 'N01.824.308.500'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['I01.800', 'K01.752.400.750', 'N06.850.505.400.425.837'], ['C23.550.291.937'], ['E01.789.800', 'N04.761.559.590.800', 'N05.715.360.575.575.800']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Humanities [K]']",0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,0
An alternative method to amplify RNA without loss of signal conservation for expression analysis with a proteinase DNA microarray in the ArrayTube format.,"BACKGROUND: Recent developments in DNA microarray technology led to a variety of open and closed devices and systems including high and low density microarrays for high-throughput screening applications as well as microarrays of lower density for specific diagnostic purposes. Beside predefined microarrays for specific applications manufacturers offer the production of custom-designed microarrays adapted to customers' wishes. Array based assays demand complex procedures including several steps for sample preparation (RNA extraction, amplification and sample labelling), hybridization and detection, thus leading to a high variability between several approaches and resulting in the necessity of extensive standardization and normalization procedures.RESULTS: In the present work a custom designed human proteinase DNA microarray of lower density in ArrayTube format was established. This highly economic open platform only requires standard laboratory equipment and allows the study of the molecular regulation of cell behaviour by proteinases. We established a procedure for sample preparation and hybridization and verified the array based gene expression profile by quantitative real-time PCR (QRT-PCR). Moreover, we compared the results with the well established Affymetrix microarray. By application of standard labelling procedures with e.g. Klenow fragment exo-, single primer amplification (SPA) or In Vitro Transcription (IVT) we noticed a loss of signal conservation for some genes. To overcome this problem we developed a protocol in accordance with the SPA protocol, in which we included target specific primers designed individually for each spotted oligomer. Here we present a complete array based assay in which only the specific transcripts of interest are amplified in parallel and in a linear manner. The array represents a proof of principle which can be adapted to other species as well.CONCLUSION: As the designed protocol for amplifying mRNA starts from as little as 100 ng total RNA, it presents an alternative method for detecting even low expressed genes by microarray experiments in a highly reproducible and sensitive manner. Preservation of signal integrity is demonstrated out by QRT-PCR measurements. The little amounts of total RNA necessary for the analyses make this method applicable for investigations with limited material as in clinical samples from, for example, organ or tumour biopsies. Those are arguments in favour of the high potential of our assay compared to established procedures for amplification within the field of diagnostic expression profiling. Nevertheless, the screening character of microarray data must be mentioned, and independent methods should verify the results.","['Cells, Cultured', 'Computer Systems', 'DNA Primers', 'DNA Probes', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Microarray Analysis', 'Nucleic Acid Amplification Techniques', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Peptide Hydrolases', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Staining and Labeling']",16768788,"[['A11.251'], ['L01.224.230'], ['D13.695.578.424.450.275', 'D27.720.470.530.600.223.600'], ['D13.444.600.223', 'D27.505.259.750.600.223', 'D27.720.470.530.600.223'], ['E05.393.332'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E05.588.570'], ['E05.393.620'], ['E05.393.661.640', 'E05.393.760.640', 'E05.588.570.660', 'E05.601.640'], ['D08.811.277.656'], ['E05.393.620.500'], ['E05.318.370.725', 'E05.337.851', 'N05.715.360.325.685', 'N06.850.520.445.725'], ['E01.370.225.500.620.670', 'E01.370.225.750.600.670', 'E05.200.500.620.670', 'E05.200.750.600.670']]","['Anatomy [A]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Health Care [N]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0
Virus infections and chronic rheumatic disorders.,"There is little direct evidence that viruses cause inflammatory arthritis in the sense that infectious agents classically cause disease. However, there are several mechanisms by which virus infections could be implicated in the pathogenesis of such disorders. In particular virus infection of lymphocytes could produce the combination of selective immunodeficiency and immune stimulation that characterizes many rheumatic disorders. In addition re-combination events between integrated pro-viruses in DNA and exogenous infections would account for the lack of any obvious correlation between the appearance of these disorders and any obvious preceding viral infection. Certainly, more sophisticated approaches will be needed to test such hypotheses rather than relying on classical techniques for viral isolation.","['Antigens, Viral', 'Arthritis, Infectious', 'Arthritis, Rheumatoid', 'Connective Tissue Diseases', 'Humans', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders', 'T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory', 'Virus Diseases']",6217974,"[['D23.050.327'], ['C01.100', 'C05.550.114.099'], ['C05.550.114.154', 'C05.799.114', 'C17.300.775.099', 'C20.111.199'], ['C17.300'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C20.543'], ['C15.604.515', 'C20.683.515'], ['A11.118.637.555.567.550.500.700', 'A11.118.637.555.567.569.200.700', 'A11.118.637.555.567.569.500.700', 'A15.145.229.637.555.567.550.500.700', 'A15.145.229.637.555.567.569.200.700', 'A15.145.229.637.555.567.569.500.700', 'A15.382.490.555.567.550.500.700', 'A15.382.490.555.567.569.200.700', 'A15.382.490.555.567.569.500.700'], ['C01.925']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Gunshot wounds caused by modern firearms in the light of our investigations.,"The experiment was carried out on 27 sheep with traumatic-haemorrhagic shock caused by a gunshot wound produced using high-velocity missiles from the HM16 rifle. Sixty minutes after injury treatment with blood-replacing fluids was started. In Group I Ringer's solution with sodium lactate pH 8.2 was infused, Group II received Ringer's solution with sodium lactate pH 6.5, and Group III was given Ringer's solution alone. Volume of the infused fluid exceeded threefold the volume of lost blood. During and after fluid replacement blood samples were drawn for biochemical investigations and haemodynamic disturbances were carefully observed. In conclusion, we can say that Ringer's solution filled the vascular bed and improved tissue perfusion, but it failed to correct metabolic and acid-base equilibrium disturbances to such a degree and for as long a long time as did Ringer's solution with lactate.","['Animals', 'Blood Substitutes', 'Firearms', 'Isotonic Solutions', ""Ringer's Lactate"", ""Ringer's Solution"", 'Sheep', 'Shock, Hemorrhagic', 'Shock, Traumatic', 'Wounds, Gunshot']",3339682,"[['B01.050'], ['D27.505.954.502.140', 'J01.637.087.249'], ['J01.637.870.350'], ['D26.776.498'], ['D26.776.498.500.500'], ['D26.776.498.750'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.500.380.791'], ['C23.550.414.980', 'C23.550.835.650'], ['C23.550.835.888', 'C26.797'], ['C26.986.900']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]', 'Diseases [C]']",0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
Endovascular repair of complex aortic aneurysms: intravascular ultrasound guidance with an intracardiac probe.,"To assess the accuracy and efficacy of intravascular ultrasound guidance obtained by an intracardiac ultrasound probe during complex aortic endografting. Between November 1999 and July 2002, 19 patients (5 female, 14 male; mean age 73.5 +/- 2.1 years) underwent endovascular repair of thoracic (n = 10), complex abdominal (n = 6) and concomitant thoraco-abdominal (n = 3) aortic aneurysm. The most suitable size and configuration of the stent-graft were chosen on the basis of preoperative computed tomographic angiography (CTA) or magnetic resonance angiography (MRA). Intraoperative intravascular ultrasound imaging was obtained using a 9 Fr, 9 MHz intracardiac echocardiography (ICE) probe, 110 cm in length, inserted through a 10 Fr precurved long sheath. The endografts were deployed as planned by CTA or MRA. Before stent-graft deployment, the ICE probe allowed us to view the posterior aortic arch and descending thoraco-abdominal aorta without position-related artifacts, and to identify both sites of stent-graft positioning. After stent-graft deployment, the ICE probe allowed us to detect the need for additional modular components to internally reline the aorta in 11 patients, and to discover 2 incomplete graft expansions subsequently treated with adjunctive balloon angioplasty. In 1 patient, the ICE probe supported the decision that the patient was ineligible for the endovascular exclusion procedure. The ICE probe provides accurate information on the anatomy of the posterior aortic arch and thoracic and abdominal aortic aneurysms and a rapid identification of attachment sites and stent-graft pathology, allowing refinement and improvement of the endovascular strategy.","['Aged', 'Aortic Aneurysm, Abdominal', 'Aortic Aneurysm, Thoracic', 'Echocardiography', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Ultrasonography, Interventional']",14753303,"[['M01.060.116.100'], ['C14.907.055.239.075', 'C14.907.109.139.075'], ['C14.907.055.239.125', 'C14.907.109.139.125'], ['E01.370.350.130.750', 'E01.370.350.850.220', 'E01.370.370.380.220'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E05.318.370.725', 'E05.337.851', 'N05.715.360.325.685', 'N06.850.520.445.725'], ['E01.370.350.850.855', 'E04.502.890']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Health Care [N]']",0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
Combining Alcohol with Benzodiazepines or Psychostimulants. Metaphoric Meanings and the Concept of Control in the Online Talk of Polydrug Use.,"The co-administration of different substances is a widespread practice in the context of hard drug use. Among others, alcohol combined with certain substances produces potentially dangerous interactions. This article explores how people who combine alcohol with benzodiazepines or psychostimulants perceive these practices and how they share their perceptions in Finnish and Swedish online discussions. This is carried out by analyzing discussants' use of metaphoric expressions. We found that the metaphors given to the use of these substance combinations reflect their pharmacological characteristics. Through that, the metaphors and meanings were different depending on the substance alcohol was combined with. Moreover, we found that, in the realities the metaphors create, the control of use was differently conceptualized. The different aspects of control could be divided into three categories that, however, were not related to any specific substances but overarched all metaphors: 1) controlling pharmacological risks, 2) controlling social appearance and 3) ignoring control. As our findings bring out, often the actual health dangers and risks of the studied substance combinations were bypassed, and the control was rather understood either as a form of socially appropriate behavior or wholly ignored.","['Adult', 'Benzodiazepines', 'Central Nervous System Depressants', 'Central Nervous System Stimulants', 'Drug Interactions', 'Ethanol', 'Finland', 'Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice', 'Humans', 'Metaphor', 'Online Social Networking', 'Qualitative Research', 'Risk-Taking', 'Self-Control', 'Social Behavior', 'Substance-Related Disorders', 'Sweden']",31547794,"[['M01.060.116'], ['D03.633.100.079.080'], ['D27.505.696.277', 'D27.505.954.427.210'], ['D27.505.696.282', 'D27.505.954.427.220'], ['G07.690.773.968'], ['D02.033.375'], ['Z01.542.816.186'], ['F01.100.150.500', 'N05.300.150.410'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['K01.400.899.500', 'K01.752.798.500'], ['L01.143.910.250'], ['H01.770.644.241.850'], ['F01.145.722'], ['F01.145.813.595'], ['F01.145.813'], ['C25.775', 'F03.900'], ['Z01.542.816.500']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Humanities [K]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]', 'Diseases [C]']",0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1
[The influence of polyvitamin complex polijen on mutagenic and cytotoxic effect of copper oxychloride in white mice].,"The present study investigates antimutagenic and anticytotoxic effect of polyvitamin complex Polijen in laboratory mice. Mutation in mice was induced by pesticide - copper oxychloride 3Cu(OH)2 CuCl2 , which is characterizes by the mutagenic and cytotoxic effect. Introduction of copper oxychloride (dosage 1/2, 1/5, 1/10 LD50) per oral to animals induces strong increase (p<0,001) of frequency of chromosomal aberrations (multiple fragments, lyses), genomic mutations (triploidy, tetraploidy), pathological mitosis (hollow metaphase, K-mitosis, adhesion of chromosomes) and destruction of interphase nucleuses (hollow nucleus). Experiments showed that administration of polyvitamin complex Polijen decreased 2, 5 times mutagenic and cytotoxic effect of pesticide-copper oxychloride.","['Animals', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Copper', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Mice', 'Mutation', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vitamins']",18633151,"[['B01.050'], ['C23.550.210', 'G05.365.590.175'], ['D01.268.556.195', 'D01.268.956.170', 'D01.552.544.195'], ['C22.232', 'E05.598.500', 'E05.599.395.080'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500'], ['G05.365.590'], ['E01.789.800', 'N04.761.559.590.800', 'N05.715.360.575.575.800'], ['D27.505.696.494.600', 'G07.203.300.681.500.600', 'J02.500.681.500.600']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0
The impact of community context on children's health and nutritional status in China.,"The link between community environment and individual health outcomes has been widely documented in Western literature, but little is known about whether community context influences children's health over and above individual characteristics in developing countries. This study examines how community socioeconomic status (SES) influences children's self-rated health and nutritional status in urban and rural China and explores whether the effects of community SES vary by a child's gender and family background. Using data from the China Family Penal Studies in 2010, this study focuses on children aged 10-15 years old living in 261 urban neighborhoods and 293 rural villages in China. Multilevel regression models are estimated to examine the effect of community SES on the probability of reporting poor/fair health and nutritional status measured by height for age while controlling for individual and family characteristics. The results suggest that community SES has a positive and curvilinear effect on children's health and nutritional status in urban China, and it only positively influences children's nutrition in rural China. Community SES has a stronger effect for boys than for girls, and for children in poorer families and families with lower levels of parental involvement.","['Adolescent', 'Body Height', 'Child', 'Child Health', 'China', 'Environment', 'Female', 'Health Status', 'Health Surveys', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Nutritional Status', 'Residence Characteristics', 'Rural Population', 'Sex Factors', 'Social Class', 'Urban Population']",28285233,"[['M01.060.057'], ['E01.370.600.115.100.160.100', 'E05.041.124.160.500', 'G07.100.100.160.100', 'G07.345.249.314.100'], ['M01.060.406'], ['N01.400.225'], ['Z01.252.474.164'], ['G16.500.275', 'N06.230'], ['I01.240.425', 'N01.224.425', 'N06.850.505.400.425'], ['E05.318.308.980.438', 'N05.715.360.300.800.438', 'N06.850.520.308.980.438'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['G07.203.650.650', 'N01.224.425.525'], ['N01.224.791', 'N06.850.505.400.800'], ['N01.600.725'], ['N05.715.350.675', 'N06.850.490.875'], ['I01.880.853.996.755', 'N01.824.782'], ['N01.600.900']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Organisms [B]']",0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1
Isolation and Western Blotting of Latex-Bead Phagosomes to Track Phagosome Maturation.,"Phagocytosis plays an essential role in the immune system for the defense against invading microorganisms and the clearing of apoptotic cells. After internalization, the newly formed phagosome is constantly remodeled by fusion with early endosomes, late endosomes, and lysosomes. These changes ultimately deliver the engulfed material into the terminal degradative compartments known as phagolysosomes. However, defective phagosome maturation can result in inflammatory or autoimmune disease depending on the type of phagosome cargo. Therefore, characterization of the components involved in phagosome formation and maturation is important for a better understanding of macrophage physiological and pathological functions. In this chapter we describe a step-by-step protocol for the isolation of large-scale latex/polystyrene bead phagosome preparations with high degrees of purity for Western blotting analysis of phagosome maturation.","['Animals', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Fractionation', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Immunoblotting', 'Mice', 'Microspheres', 'Phagocytosis', 'Phagosomes', 'RAW 264.7 Cells']",27815884,"[['B01.050'], ['E05.196.401.143', 'E05.301.300.096', 'E05.478.566.320.200', 'E05.601.262', 'E05.601.470.320.200'], ['E05.242.251'], ['E05.196.401.402', 'E05.301.300.319'], ['E05.478.566.320', 'E05.601.470.320'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500'], ['E07.565'], ['G04.417.350', 'G09.188.665', 'G12.450.564.809', 'G12.688'], ['A11.284.430.214.190.875.190.700'], ['A11.251.210.172.875', 'A11.733.397.815']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Individuals with pulmonary tuberculosis have lower levels of circulating CD1d-restricted NKT cells.,"Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) is a leading cause of mortality worldwide from an infectious agent. Natural killer T (NKT) cells recognize mycobacterial antigens and contribute to anti-MTB immunity in mouse models. NKT cells were measured in subjects with pulmonary tuberculosis, MTB-exposed individuals, and healthy controls. NKT cell levels are selectively lower in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from individuals with pulmonary tuberculosis than in both MTB-exposed subjects and healthy control subjects. This apparent loss of NKT cells from the peripheral blood is sustained during the 6 months after the initiation of MTB treatment. These findings indicate that NKT cells may be an important component of antituberculosis immunity.","['Adult', 'Antigens, CD1', 'Antigens, CD1d', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear', 'Male', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'Tuberculosis, Pulmonary']",17397008,"[['M01.060.116'], ['D23.050.301.264.035.100', 'D23.050.301.264.894.080', 'D23.101.100.110.100', 'D23.101.100.894.080'], ['D23.050.301.264.035.100.500', 'D23.050.301.264.894.080.500', 'D23.101.100.110.100.500', 'D23.101.100.894.080.500'], ['E05.318.372.500.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.500'], ['E01.370.225.500.363.342', 'E01.370.225.500.386.350', 'E05.196.712.516.600.240.350', 'E05.200.500.363.342', 'E05.200.500.386.350', 'E05.242.363.342', 'E05.242.386.350'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['A11.118.637.555.567.537', 'A15.145.229.637.555.567.537', 'A15.382.490.555.567.537'], ['A11.118.637.555', 'A15.145.229.637.555', 'A15.382.490.555'], ['B03.510.024.962.500.702', 'B03.510.460.400.410.552.552.702'], ['C01.150.252.410.040.552.846.899', 'C01.748.939', 'C08.381.922', 'C08.730.939']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Diseases [C]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
Recurrent deep neck abscess and piriform sinus tract: a 15-year review on the diagnosis and management.,BACKGROUND: Piriform sinus tract (PST) is a rare congenital condition. A delay in diagnosis is common leading to recurrent inflammation.METHOD: A retrospective review was performed on all cases of PST treated at a tertiary referral centre between May 1997 and May 2012.RESULTS: Eighteen patients were reviewed with a mean age of 5.4years at presentation (ranged from 0day to 14years). Most patients presented as acute inflammation (88.9%) and 16 had a left sided lesion. 72.2% of the PST are identified by contrast swallow study. The diagnostic yield was significantly higher if the study was done after the initial acute inflammation settled. Ultrasonography and computer tomography are less sensitive. The median duration from presentation to diagnosis was 17.6months (ranged 0-120months). Ten patients (55.6%) experienced recurrent inflammation before confirming the diagnosis. Fistulectomy alone was performed in 15 patients while an additional en-bloc hemithyroidectomy was done in 2 patients.CONCLUSION: PST should be suspected in children presenting with a left deep neck abscess. Contrast swallow study is very effective in making diagnosis but has to be postponed after the acute inflammation settles. The condition can be effectively treated by fistulectomy without hemithyroidectomy in majority of our cases.,"['Abscess', 'Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Drainage', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Neck', 'Pyriform Sinus', 'Recurrence', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Thyroiditis, Suppurative', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed', 'Treatment Outcome']",25092087,"[['C01.830.025', 'C23.550.470.756.100'], ['M01.060.057'], ['M01.060.406'], ['M01.060.406.448'], ['E01.171'], ['E02.309', 'E04.237'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.249', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.350', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.350'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.703'], ['M01.060.703.520'], ['A01.598'], ['A04.623.490.600'], ['C23.550.291.937'], ['E05.318.372.500.500.500', 'E05.318.372.500.750.750', 'N05.715.360.330.500.500.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.825', 'N06.850.520.450.500.500.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.825'], ['C01.830.840', 'C19.874.871.910'], ['E01.370.350.350.810', 'E01.370.350.600.350.700.810', 'E01.370.350.700.700.810', 'E01.370.350.700.810.810', 'E01.370.350.825.810.810'], ['E01.789.800', 'N04.761.559.590.800', 'N05.715.360.575.575.800']]","['Diseases [C]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
Linking planning performance and gray matter density in mid-dorsolateral prefrontal cortex: moderating effects of age and sex.,"Planning of behavior relies on the integrity of the mid-dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (mid-dlPFC). Yet, only indirect evidence exists on the association of protracted maturation of dlPFC and continuing gains in planning performance post adolescence. Here, gray matter density of mid-dlPFC in young, healthy adults (18-32 years) was regressed onto performance on the Tower of London planning task while accounting for moderating effects of age and sex on this interrelation. Multiple regression analysis revealed an association of planning performance and mid-dlPFC gray matter density that was especially strong in late adolescence and early twenties. As expected, for males better planning performance was linked to reduced gray matter density of mid-dlPFC, possibly due to maturational processes such as synaptic pruning. Most surprisingly, females showed an inverted, positive interrelation of planning performance and mid-dlPFC gray matter density, indicating that sexually dimorphic development of dlPFC continues during early adulthood. Age and sex are hence important moderators of the link between planning performance and gray matter density in mid-dlPFC. Consequently, the assessment of moderator effects in regression designs can significantly enhance understanding of brain-behavior relationships.","['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Brain Mapping', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Male', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Problem Solving', 'Sex Factors', 'Thinking', 'Young Adult']",22921922,"[['M01.060.057'], ['M01.060.116'], ['N05.715.350.075', 'N06.850.490.250'], ['E01.370.350.578.875.500', 'E01.370.376.537.625.500', 'E05.629.875.500'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E01.158.600', 'E01.370.350.350', 'L01.313.500.750.100.158.600'], ['E01.370.350.825.500'], ['A08.186.211.200.885.287.500.270.700'], ['F02.463.425.725', 'F02.463.785.810'], ['N05.715.350.675', 'N06.850.490.875'], ['F02.463.785'], ['M01.060.116.815']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]']",1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0
"Psychiatric comorbidity and 30-day readmissions after hospitalization for heart failure, AMI, and pneumonia.","OBJECTIVE: In 2012, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services implemented a policy that penalizes hospitals for ""excessive"" all-cause hospital readmissions within 30 days after discharge from an index hospitalization for heart failure (HF), acute myocardial infarction (AMI), and pneumonia. The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of psychiatric comorbidities on 30-day all-cause readmissions following hospitalizations for HF, AMI, and pneumonia.METHODS: Data from 2009-2011 were derived from the HMO Research Network Virtual Data Warehouse of 11 health systems affiliated with the Mental Health Research Network. All index inpatient hospitalizations for HF, AMI, and pneumonia were captured (N=160,169). Psychiatric diagnoses for the year prior to admission were measured. All-cause readmissions within 30 days of discharge were the outcome variable.RESULTS: Approximately 18% of all individuals with index inpatient hospitalizations for HF, AMI, and pneumonia were readmitted within 30 days. The rate of readmission was 5% greater for individuals with a psychiatric comorbidity compared with those without a psychiatric comorbidity (21.7% and 16.5%, respectively, p<.001). Depression, anxiety, and dementia were associated with more readmissions of persons with index hospitalizations for each general medical condition and for all the conditions combined (p<.05). Substance use and bipolar disorders were linked with higher readmissions for those with initial hospitalizations for HF and pneumonia (p<.05). Readmission rates declined overall from 2009 to 2011.CONCLUSIONS: Individuals with HF, AMI, and pneumonia experience high rates of readmission, but psychiatric comorbidities appear to increase that risk. Future interventions to reduce readmission should consider adding mental health components.","['Adult', 'Aged', 'Comorbidity', 'Female', 'Heart Failure', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mental Disorders', 'Middle Aged', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Patient Readmission', 'Pneumonia', 'Time Factors', 'United States']",25642610,"[['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['N05.715.350.225', 'N06.850.490.687'], ['C14.280.434'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['F03'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['C14.280.647.500', 'C14.907.585.500', 'C23.550.513.355.750', 'C23.550.717.489.750'], ['E02.760.400.620', 'N02.421.585.400.620'], ['C01.748.610', 'C08.381.677', 'C08.730.610'], ['G01.910.857'], ['Z01.107.567.875']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Geographicals [Z]']",0,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1
Nurse managers' strategies for feeling less drained by their work: an action research and reflection project for developing emotional intelligence.,"AIMS: To raise nurse managers' critical awareness of practice problems; uncover practice constraints and improve work effectiveness.BACKGROUND: Nurse management requires skills and knowledge, underscored by emotional intelligence. The research improved participants' practice and personal insights.METHODS: Purposive sampling targeted nurse managers interested in improving their practice. Three experienced female nurse managers met fortnightly in a group, for 1 hour, for 10 meetings. The methods included: writing and sharing de-identified journal reflections; critically analysing practice stories; identifying a thematic concern; generating action strategies; and instituting and revising the action plan.RESULTS: Phase One resulted in the identification of the issue of 'being drained by the intensity of nurse managers' work'. The participants adopted five strategies: debriefing problematic situations; deflecting multiple requests; diffusing issues; naming dysfunctional behaviours; and regrouping. In Phase Two, participants implemented and revised the action plan strategies, which resulted in them feeling less drained by their work.CONCLUSIONS: Strategies can lessen nurse managers' sense of personal depletion. However, strategies cannot guarantee success every time because the emotional intelligence is integral to nurse management.IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING MANAGEMENT: Action research and reflection assist nurse managers to improve their practice and develop their emotional intelligence.","['Adaptation, Psychological', 'Attitude of Health Personnel', 'Awareness', 'Burnout, Professional', 'Emotional Intelligence', 'Female', 'Health Services Research', 'Humans', 'Nurse Administrators', 'Nursing Staff, Hospital', 'Problem Solving']",24655218,"[['F01.058'], ['F01.100.050', 'N05.300.100'], ['F02.463.188.150'], ['C24.580.500', 'F01.145.126.990.367.500', 'F02.830.900.333.500'], ['F01.752.543.500'], ['H01.770.644.145.360', 'N03.349.380', 'N05.425'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.526.070.670', 'M01.526.485.650.580', 'N02.360.650.580'], ['M01.526.485.680.490', 'M01.526.485.740.523', 'N02.360.680.490', 'N02.360.740.523'], ['F02.463.425.725', 'F02.463.785.810']]","['Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Named Groups [M]']",0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0
Heart Valve Disease Awareness Survey 2017: what did we achieve since 2015?,"AIMS: The 2015 Heart Valve Disease Awareness Survey showed a low knowledge and awareness about heart valve disease in the general population despite its high prevalence and morbidity. The 2017 survey was conducted to re-evaluate concern and knowledge about heart valve disease after 2 years of rapidly increasing patient numbers presenting with heart valve disease.METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 12,820 people aged 60 years or older in 11 European countries took part in the survey. While the number of people concerned most about heart valve disease increased significantly (2015:1.7% vs. 2017:2.1%; p < 0.001), it is still very low compared to cancer (28.8%) or Alzheimer's disease (20.9%). More people claim to be familiar with heart valve disease in general (2015: 17.1% vs. 2017: 20.0%; p < 0.001) and the majority claims to know of at least one therapy for heart valve disease (61.9%). Nevertheless, only 3.8% could correctly identify aortic stenosis (AS), which is significantly less than in 2015 (7.2%; p < 0.001). As before, the majority of the respondents claimed to rarely or never undergo a stethoscope check from their general practitioner (2015: 54.2% vs. 2017: 50.6%, p < 0.001); nevertheless, a positive trend can be seen. People wish heart valve disease to be part of regular checks by the general practitioners.CONCLUSION: The general population's knowledge of heart valve disease in general slightly increased over the last 2 years. However, detailed understanding of aortic stenosis and its treatment options is still low, as is the level of concern shown for heart valve disease. Nevertheless, the general population cites heart valve disease as a condition they wish to be checked for regularly.","['Awareness', 'Europe', 'Female', 'Heart Valve Diseases', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Patient Education as Topic', 'Prevalence', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Surveys and Questionnaires']",29943272,"[['F02.463.188.150'], ['Z01.542'], ['C14.280.484'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['I02.233.332.500', 'N02.421.726.407.680'], ['E05.318.308.985.525.750', 'N01.224.935.597.750', 'N06.850.505.400.975.525.750', 'N06.850.520.308.985.525.750'], ['E05.318.372.500.500.500', 'E05.318.372.500.750.750', 'N05.715.360.330.500.500.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.825', 'N06.850.520.450.500.500.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.825'], ['E05.318.308.980', 'N05.715.360.300.800', 'N06.850.520.308.980']]","['Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1

Effects of spatially varying selection on nucleotide diversity and linkage disequilibrium: insights from deer mouse globin genes.,"An important goal of population genetics is to elucidate the effects of natural selection on patterns of DNA sequence variation. Here we report results of a study to assess the joint effects of selection, recombination, and gene flow in shaping patterns of nucleotide variation at genes involved in local adaptation. We first describe a new summary statistic, Z(g), that measures the between-sample component of linkage disequilibrium (LD). We then report results of a multilocus survey of nucleotide diversity and LD between high- and low-altitude populations of deer mice, Peromyscus maniculatus. The multilocus survey included two closely linked alpha-globin genes, HBA-T1 and HBA-T2, that underlie adaptation to different elevational zones. The primary goals were to assess whether the alpha-globin genes exhibit the hallmarks of spatially varying selection that are predicted by theory (i.e., sharply defined peaks in the between-population components of nucleotide diversity and LD) and to assess whether peaks in diversity and LD may be useful for identifying specific sites that distinguish selectively maintained alleles. Consistent with theoretical expectations, HBA-T1 and HBA-T2 were characterized by highly elevated levels of diversity between populations and between allele classes. Simulation and empirical results indicate that sliding-window analyses of Z(g) between allele classes may provide an effective means of pinpointing causal substitutions.","['Alleles', 'Animals', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Diploidy', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genetics, Population', 'Genome', 'Globins', 'Linkage Disequilibrium', 'Models, Genetic', 'Models, Theoretical', 'Multigene Family', 'Nucleotides', 'Peromyscus', 'Recombination, Genetic']",18716337,"[['G05.360.340.024.340.030'], ['B01.050'], ['E05.393.220'], ['G05.700.264'], ['G05.365'], ['H01.158.273.343.335'], ['G05.360.340'], ['D12.776.422.316'], ['G05.348.500'], ['E05.599.395.397'], ['E05.599'], ['G05.360.340.024.340.645'], ['D09.408.620', 'D13.695'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.075.500.510'], ['G05.728']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]']",0,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
Effect of biofilm in irrigation pipes on microbial quality of irrigation water.,"AIMS: The focus of this work was to investigate the contribution of native Escherichia coli to the microbial quality of irrigation water and to determine the potential for contamination by E. coli associated with heterotrophic biofilms in pipe-based irrigation water delivery systems.METHODS AND RESULTS: The aluminium pipes in the sprinkler irrigation system were outfitted with coupons that were extracted before each of the 2-h long irrigations carried out with weekly intervals. Water from the creek water and sprinklers, residual water from the previous irrigation and biofilms on the coupons were analysed for E. coli. High E. coli concentrations in water remaining in irrigation pipes between irrigation events were indicative of E. coli growth. In two of the four irrigations, the probability of the sample source, (creek vs sprinkler), being a noninfluential factor, was only 0.14, that is, source was an important factor. The population of bacteria associated with the biofilm on pipe walls was estimated to be larger than that in water in pipes in the first three irrigation events and comparable to one in the fourth event.CONCLUSION: Biofilm-associated E. coli can affect microbial quality of irrigation water and, therefore, should not be neglected when estimating bacterial mass balances for irrigation systems.SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This work is the first peer-reviewed report on the impact of biofilms on microbial quality of irrigation waters. Flushing of the irrigation system may be a useful management practice to decrease the risk of microbial contamination of produce. Because microbial water quality can be substantially modified while water is transported in an irrigation system, it becomes imperative to monitor water quality at fields, rather than just at the intake.","['Agricultural Irrigation', 'Biofilms', 'Escherichia coli', 'Water Microbiology', 'Water Quality', 'Water Supply']",22150421,"[['J01.040.044'], ['A20.593', 'G06.120'], ['B03.440.450.425.325.300', 'B03.660.250.150.180.100'], ['H01.158.273.540.274.777', 'N06.850.425.450'], ['N06.850.460.350.080.750', 'N06.850.460.790.730'], ['J01.293.821.500']]","['Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]', 'Health Care [N]']",1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0

PI31 Is an Adaptor Protein for Proteasome Transport in Axons and Required for Synaptic Development.,"Protein degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome system is critical for neuronal function. Neurons utilize microtubule-dependent molecular motors to allocate proteasomes to synapses, but how proteasomes are coupled to motors and how this is regulated to meet changing demand for protein breakdown remain largely unknown. We show that the conserved proteasome-binding protein PI31 serves as an adaptor to couple proteasomes with dynein light chain proteins (DYNLL1/2). The inactivation of PI31 inhibited proteasome motility in axons and disrupted synaptic proteostasis, structure, and function. Moreover, phosphorylation of PI31 by p38 MAPK enhanced binding to DYNLL1/2 and promoted the directional movement of proteasomes in axons, suggesting a mechanism to regulate loading of proteasomes onto motors. Inactivation of PI31 in mouse neurons attenuated proteasome movement in axons, indicating this process is conserved. Because mutations affecting PI31 activity are associated with human neurodegenerative diseases, impairment of PI31-mediated axonal transport of proteasomes may contribute to these disorders.","['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Animals', 'Axonal Transport', 'Axons', 'Cytoplasm', 'Cytoplasmic Dyneins', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Microtubules', 'Neurons', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex', 'Proteins', 'Proteolysis', 'Proteostasis', 'Synapses', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases']",31327739,"[['D12.644.360.024', 'D12.776.157.057', 'D12.776.476.024'], ['B01.050'], ['G03.143.355.040', 'G04.392.040', 'G11.561.050'], ['A08.675.542.145', 'A11.284.180.075', 'A11.671.137', 'A11.671.501.145'], ['A11.284.430.214'], ['D08.811.277.040.025.193.249.750'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500'], ['A11.284.430.214.190.750.602'], ['A08.675', 'A11.671'], ['D05.500.562.500', 'D08.811.277.656.918', 'D08.811.600.730'], ['D12.776'], ['G02.111.720', 'G03.812'], ['G02.111.730', 'G03.816'], ['A08.850', 'A11.284.149.165.420.780'], ['D08.811.913.696.620.682.700.567.843', 'D12.644.360.450.835', 'D12.776.476.450.835']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Discovery of fairy circles in Australia supports self-organization theory.,"Vegetation gap patterns in arid grasslands, such as the ""fairy circles"" of Namibia, are one of nature's greatest mysteries and subject to a lively debate on their origin. They are characterized by small-scale hexagonal ordering of circular bare-soil gaps that persists uniformly in the landscape scale to form a homogeneous distribution. Pattern-formation theory predicts that such highly ordered gap patterns should be found also in other water-limited systems across the globe, even if the mechanisms of their formation are different. Here we report that so far unknown fairy circles with the same spatial structure exist 10,000 km away from Namibia in the remote outback of Australia. Combining fieldwork, remote sensing, spatial pattern analysis, and process-based mathematical modeling, we demonstrate that these patterns emerge by self-organization, with no correlation with termite activity; the driving mechanism is a positive biomass-water feedback associated with water runoff and biomass-dependent infiltration rates. The remarkable match between the patterns of Australian and Namibian fairy circles and model results indicate that both patterns emerge from a nonuniform stationary instability, supporting a central universality principle of pattern-formation theory. Applied to the context of dryland vegetation, this principle predicts that different systems that go through the same instability type will show similar vegetation patterns even if the feedback mechanisms and resulting soil-water distributions are different, as we indeed found by comparing the Australian and the Namibian fairy-circle ecosystems. These results suggest that biomass-water feedbacks and resultant vegetation gap patterns are likely more common in remote drylands than is currently known.","['Biomass', 'Feedback, Physiological', 'Grassland', 'Models, Biological', 'Namibia', 'Plant Development', 'Poaceae', 'Rain', 'Western Australia']",26976567,"[['G16.500.275.157.100', 'N06.230.124.100'], ['G07.410.732'], ['G16.500.275.157.531', 'N06.230.124.390'], ['E05.599.395'], ['Z01.058.290.175.580'], ['G07.345.625', 'G15.589'], ['B01.650.940.800.575.912.250.822'], ['G16.500.175.859', 'G16.500.275.063.725.395', 'G16.500.750.775.450', 'N06.230.300.100.725.450', 'N06.230.520'], ['Z01.639.100.996', 'Z01.678.100.373.996']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Organisms [B]']",0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1
Randomized controlled trial on the influence of dietary intervention on epigenetic mechanisms in children with cow's milk allergy: the EPICMA study.,"Epigenetic mechanisms could drive the disease course of cow's milk allergy (CMA) and formula choice could modulate these pathways. We compared the effect of two different dietary approaches on epigenetic mechanisms in CMA children. Randomized controlled trial on IgE-mediated CMA children receiving a 12-month treatment with extensively hydrolyzed casein formula containing the probiotic L.rhamnosus GG (EHCF + LGG) or with soy formula (SF). At the baseline, after 6 and 12 months of treatment FoxP3 methylation rate and its expression in CD4+ T cells were assessed. At same study points IL-4, IL-5, IL-10, and IFN-ã methylation rate, expression and serum concentration, miRNAs expression were also investigated. 20 children (10/group) were evaluated. Baseline demographic, clinical and epigenetic features were similar in the two study groups. At 6 and 12 months, EHCF + LGG group showed a significant increase in FoxP3 demethylation rate compared to SF group. At the same study points, EHCF + LGG group presented a higher increase in IL-4 and IL-5 and a higher reduction in IL-10 and IFN-ã DNA methylation rate compared to SF group. A different modulation of miR-155, -146a, -128 and -193a expression was observed in EHCF + LGG vs. SF. Dietary intervention could exert a different epigenetic modulation on the immune system in CMA children.","['Animals', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes', 'Caseins', 'Cattle', 'Child', 'DNA Methylation', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Female', 'Forkhead Transcription Factors', 'Humans', 'Hydrolysis', 'Immune System', 'Lactobacillus rhamnosus', 'Male', 'Milk Hypersensitivity', 'Probiotics']",30808949,"[['B01.050'], ['A11.118.637.555.567.569.200', 'A15.145.229.637.555.567.569.200', 'A15.382.490.555.567.569.200'], ['D12.776.256.159.750.207', 'D12.776.744.150'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.500.380.271'], ['M01.060.406'], ['G02.111.035.538.161', 'G02.111.218', 'G03.059.538.161', 'G05.206'], ['G05.308.203'], ['D12.776.260.950.249', 'D12.776.930.977.249'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['G02.380'], ['A15.382'], ['B03.353.750.450.475.700', 'B03.510.460.400.410.475.475.700', 'B03.510.550.450.475.700'], ['C20.543.480.370.500'], ['G07.203.300.456.500', 'J02.500.456.500']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]']",1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0
Training of working memory in children with ADHD.,"Working memory (WM) capacity is the ability to retain and manipulate information during a short period of time. This ability underlies complex reasoning and has generally been regarded as a fixed trait of the individual. Children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) represent one group of subjects with a WM deficit, attributed to an impairment of the frontal lobe. In the present study, we used a new training paradigm with intensive and adaptive training of WM tasks and evaluated the effect of training with a double blind, placebo controlled design. Training significantly enhanced performance on the trained WM tasks. More importantly, the training significantly improved performance on a nontrained visuo-spatial WM task and on Raven's Progressive Matrices, which is a nonverbal complex reasoning task. In addition, motor activity--as measured by the number of head movements during a computerized test--was significantly reduced in the treatment group. A second experiment showed that similar training-induced improvements on cognitive tasks are also possible in young adults without ADHD. These results demonstrate that performance on WM tasks can be significantly improved by training, and that the training effect also generalizes to nontrained tasks requiring WM. Training improved performance on tasks related to prefrontal functioning and had also a significant effect on motor activity in children with ADHD. The results thus suggest that WM training potentially could be of clinical use for ameliorating the symptoms in ADHD.","['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity', 'Child', 'Cognition', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Memory', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'Task Performance and Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome']",12424652,"[['M01.060.057'], ['M01.060.116'], ['F03.625.094.150'], ['M01.060.406'], ['F02.463.188'], ['E05.318.370.300', 'E05.581.500.300', 'N05.715.360.325.320', 'N06.850.520.445.300'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['F02.463.425.540'], ['F04.711.513'], ['F02.784.412.846', 'F02.784.692.746', 'F02.808.600'], ['E01.789.800', 'N04.761.559.590.800', 'N05.715.360.575.575.800']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]']",0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
Preparation and antioxidant activity of Lycium barbarum oligosaccharides.,"In this study, the Lycium barbarum oligosaccharides (LBO) were prepared by hydrolysis using hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂).

Assessment of hepatic blood flow using continuous infusion of high clearance drugs.,"AIMS: To provide methods for the translation of the concentration-time profile of highly cleared marker compounds into the underlying clearance and hepatic blood flow profile.METHODS: Continuous infusion of indocyanine green or sorbitol was used to assess the effect of the hepatic blood flow modifiers exercise, somatostatin and octreotide. Three distinct methods are described for the translation of concentration into flow: 1. assuming successive phases of constant clearance 2. point to point estimation of clearance using estimates of concentration change 3. using a parametric description of the flow profile in combination with the differential equations describing the change in marker concentrations.RESULTS: The marker compound concentration profiles are adequately described using the different methods. Exercise results in a decrease in hepatic blood flow of about 80%. Somatostatin and octreotide elicit an indistinguishable hepatic blood flow decrease from 1.49 to 1.07 l min(-1). Return to baseline takes much longer for octreotide (half-life 126+/-104 min) than for somatostatin (half-life 4.29+/-3.55 min).CONCLUSIONS: Translation of concentration profiles into clearance profiles is possible making continuous assessment of hepatic blood flow feasible.","['Coloring Agents', 'Exercise', 'Half-Life', 'Hormone Antagonists', 'Hormones', 'Humans', 'Indicators and Reagents', 'Indocyanine Green', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Liver Circulation', 'Metabolic Clearance Rate', 'Models, Biological', 'Octreotide', 'Somatostatin', 'Sorbitol']",9643619,"[['D27.720.233'], ['G11.427.410.698.277', 'I03.350'], ['G01.910.405'], ['D06.347', 'D27.505.696.399.450'], ['D06.472', 'D27.505.696.399.472'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D27.720.470.410'], ['D03.633.100.473.400'], ['E02.319.267.082.500', 'E02.319.267.510.590'], ['G09.330.100.881.552'], ['E01.370.225.843', 'E05.200.843', 'G03.490', 'G07.690.595', 'G07.690.725.513'], ['E05.599.395'], ['D04.345.566.650', 'D12.644.641.650'], ['D06.472.699.327.700.875', 'D06.472.699.587.780', 'D12.644.400.400.700.875', 'D12.644.548.365.700.875', 'D12.644.548.586.780', 'D12.776.631.650.405.700.875'], ['D02.033.800.813', 'D09.853.813']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0
[Pathogenesis of retrobulbar neuritis].,"Biological fluids from 146 patients with retrobulbar neuritis were examined for the biochemical, immunochemical and immunologic characteristics that mirror destructive processes in myelin and changes in the system of the cholinoglycine cycle which is one of the stages of the synthesis of myelin in the oligodendrocyte. In the majority of observations, the changes in these reactions of different directions and of varying intensity were revealed. Based on the data obtained the conclusion is made that part of the patients with retrobulbar neuritis may be attributed to multiple sclerosis since according to the laboratory findings, the demyelinating process occurring in them goes beyond optic nerves. Besides, it has been shown with special reference to retrobulbar neuritis that the primary affect, possibly of the viral nature, is likely to be localized in the oligodendrocyte, with myelin being involved in the process for the second time.","['Humans', 'Leucyl Aminopeptidase', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Myelin Proteins', 'Myelin Sheath', 'Oligodendroglia', 'Optic Nerve', 'Optic Neuritis']",1326167,"[['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D08.811.277.656.350.100.511', 'D08.811.277.656.350.555.700', 'D08.811.277.656.675.555.700'], ['C10.114.375.500', 'C10.314.350.500', 'C20.111.258.250.500'], ['D12.776.543.620', 'D12.776.631.580'], ['A08.637.600.500', 'A08.637.800.500', 'A08.675.542.512.560', 'A08.800.800.690.500', 'A10.755.503', 'A11.284.149.165.600', 'A11.650.600.500', 'A11.650.800.500', 'A11.671.501.512.560', 'A11.671.514.553'], ['A08.637.600', 'A11.650.600'], ['A08.800.800.120.680'], ['C10.292.700.550', 'C11.640.576']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Spider web glue: two proteins expressed from opposite strands of the same DNA sequence.,"The various silks that make up the web of the orb web spiders have been studied extensively. However, success in prey capture depends as much on the web glue as on the fibers. Spider silk glue, which is considered one of the strongest and most effective biological glues, is an aqueous solution secreted from the orb weaving spider's aggregate glands and coats the spiral prey capturing threads of their webs. Studies identified the major component of the glue as microscopic nodules made of a glycoprotein. This study describes two newly discovered proteins that form the glue-glycoprotein of the golden orb weaving spider Nephila clavipes . Our results demonstrate that both proteins contain unique 110 amino acid repetitive domains that are encoded by opposite strands of the same DNA sequence. Thus, the genome of the spider encodes two distinct yet functionally related genes by using both strands of an identical DNA sequence. Moreover, the closest match for the nonrepetitive region of one of the proteins is chitin binding proteins. The web glue appears to have evolved a substantial level of sophistication matching that of the spider silk fibers.","['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Northern', 'DNA', 'Insect Proteins', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Spiders']",19731928,"[['G02.111.570.060', 'L01.453.245.667.060'], ['B01.050'], ['G02.111.570.080', 'G05.360.080', 'L01.453.245.667.080'], ['E05.196.401.095', 'E05.301.300.074', 'E05.601.100'], ['D13.444.308'], ['D12.776.093.500'], ['L01.453.245.667'], ['E05.393.620.500'], ['G02.111.810.200', 'G05.810.200'], ['B01.050.500.131.166.803']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]']",0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Severe maternal psychopathology and infant-mother attachment.,"Eighty-two mother-infant dyads, comprising women with psychiatric disorder and individually matched controls, were followed up over the children's 1st year of life. The mothers with mental illness consisted of two subgroups: first, 25 severely mentally ill mothers who had been admitted to a psychiatric unit with their infants; and second, 16 mothers from a community sample meeting research diagnostic criteria for unipolar, nonpsychotic depression. With the exception of six dyads in the in-patient group, observations were made of the mother-infant interaction and the quality of the infant-mother attachment relationship at 12 months. The nature and course of the mothers' illness was also documented. Although few residual symptoms of maternal mental illness were detected at 1 year postpartum, interactional disturbances were evident among the case group dyads. A strong association was revealed between infant-mother attachment quality and maternal diagnosis; a manic episode of illness in the postpartum period was related to security in the attachment relationship, and psychotic or nonpsychotic depression was related to insecurity. Concurrent patterns of mother-infant interaction provided support for this finding.","['Adult', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Child of Impaired Parents', 'Depressive Disorder, Major', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Mental Disorders', 'Mother-Child Relations', 'Object Attachment', 'Patient Admission', 'Personality Assessment', 'Personality Development', 'Psychotic Disorders']",10847622,"[['M01.060.116'], ['F03.084.500'], ['M01.106'], ['F03.600.300.375'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.249', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.350', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.350'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.703'], ['F03'], ['F01.829.263.370.290.170'], ['F02.739.794.624'], ['E02.760.400.600', 'N02.421.585.400.600'], ['F04.513'], ['F01.752.747'], ['F03.700.675']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]']",0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0

On the other hand, methylation of Cys 121, reduces the affinity of Blg for palmitic acid by 10-fold as monitored by intrinsic fluorescence. Modification of the Cys 121 with methylmethanethiosulfonate or a thiol-specific spin label appears to either further weaken or totally eliminate fatty acid binding, respectively, due to steric hindrance. Furthermore, this binding pattern has been independently verified using a spin labeled fatty acid analog and monitoring ESR as well as by bis-ANS fluorescence when bound to the protein. These results suggest that fatty acids bind at the ""external site"" of beta-lactoglobulin, between the sole alpha-helix and the beta-barrel. In addition, structural stability studies of native and chemically modified Blg appear to confirm this observation as well.","['Anilino Naphthalenesulfonates', 'Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'Cattle', 'Cyclic N-Oxides', 'Cysteine', 'Electron Spin Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Fluorescence', 'Fluorescent Dyes', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Lactoglobulins', 'Ligands', 'Methyl Methanesulfonate', 'Methylation', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Structure', 'Palmitic Acid', 'Protein Binding', 'Spin Labels', 'Vitamin A']",9514270,"[['D02.092.146.125', 'D02.455.426.559.847.638.555.282', 'D02.886.645.600.080.050.650.050', 'D04.615.638.555.282'], ['B01.050'], ['G02.111.570.120'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.500.380.271'], ['D03.661.243'], ['D02.886.030.230', 'D02.886.489.155', 'D12.125.154.299', 'D12.125.166.230'], ['E05.196.867.519.274'], ['G01.358.500.505.650.665.500', 'G01.590.540.665.500'], ['D27.720.233.348', 'D27.720.470.410.505.500'], ['G02.300'], ['D12.776.256.159.750.816.500', 'D12.776.377.457'], ['D27.720.470.480'], ['D02.455.326.146.100.050.500.500', 'D02.886.645.600.055.050.510.500'], ['G02.111.035.538', 'G02.607.094.538', 'G03.059.538'], ['E05.599.595'], ['G02.111.570', 'G02.466'], ['D10.251.694.750'], ['G02.111.679', 'G03.808'], ['D02.389.678'], ['D02.455.326.271.665.202.495.818', 'D02.455.426.392.368.367.379.249.700.860', 'D02.455.849.131.495.818', 'D02.455.849.291.925', 'D23.767.261.700.860']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
[Poststernotomy mediastinitis treated by early surgical intervention].,"Poststernotomy mediastinitis in 67-year-old female was successfully treated by early operation after coronary artery revascularization using bilateral internal mammary arteries and gastroepiploic artery. Wider debridement including sternum, ribs, mediastinal fat and connective tissues, and transfer of rt-pectoralis major muscle flap into the mediastinum to obliterate the dead space was performed. The sternal wound was primarily closed without postoperative irrigation. The sternum was stayed open without using any artificial substitute. In conclusion, the early diagnosis and operation is the key for successful treatment of poststernotomy mediastinitis. Wider debridement including sternum and ribs with perioperative lavage by diluted povidone-iodine solution and antibiotic solution should be done aggressively, and the transfer of the major pectoral muscle flap and skin closure without postoperative irrigation is an effective method of choice.

Competition and growth among Aedes aegypti larvae: Effects of distributing food inputs over time.,"Male and female mosquito larvae compete for different subsets of the yeast food resource in laboratory microcosms. Males compete more intensely with males, and females with females. The amount and timing of food inputs alters both growth and competition, but the effects are different between sexes. Increased density increases competition among males. Among females, density operates primarily by changing the food/larva or total food; this affects competition in some interactions and growth in others. Food added earlier in the life span contributes more to mass than the same quantity added later. After a period of starvation larvae appear to use some of the subsequent food input to rebuild physiological reserves in addition to building mass. The timing of pupation is affected by the independent factors and competition, but not in the same way for the two sexes, and not in the same way as mass at pupation for the two sexes. There is an effect of density on the timing of pupation for females independent of competition or changes in food/larva or total food. Male and female larvae have different larval life history strategies. Males grow quickly to a minimum size, then pupate, depending on the amount of food available. Males that do not grow quickly enough may delay pupation further to grow larger, resulting in a bimodal distribution of sizes and ages. Males appear to have a maximum size determined by the early food level. Females grow faster than males and grow larger than males on the same food inputs. Females affect the growth and competition among males by manipulating the number of particles in the microcosm through changes in feeding behavior. Mosquito larvae appear to have evolved to survive periods of starvation and take advantage of intermittent inputs of food into containers.","['Aedes', 'Animal Feed', 'Animals', 'Body Size', 'Ecosystem', 'Female', 'Larva', 'Male', 'Population Density', 'Sex Characteristics', 'Species Specificity']",33006964,"[['B01.050.500.131.617.720.500.500.750.712.500.875.100'], ['G07.203.300.300.100', 'J02.500.300.100'], ['B01.050'], ['E01.370.600.115.100.160', 'E05.041.124.160', 'G07.100.100.160', 'G07.345.249.314'], ['G16.500.275.157', 'N06.230.124'], ['B05.500.500', 'G07.345.500.550.500.500'], ['N01.224.600', 'N06.850.505.400.600'], ['G08.686.815'], ['G16.824']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]']",0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0
Glutamine synthetase in cultured whole retinas from the embryonic chick. Role of protein and RNA syntheses in 4 degrees C storage enhancement.,"Glutamine synthetase (GS) activity is enhanced in cultured whole retinas when a 72 h incubation at 37 degrees C is preceded by storage at 4 degrees C for 2-24 h. This enhancement occurs even in the absence of glucocorticoids and is maximal in retinas from 11 to 14 d embryos. In comparison, cortisol-induced increases in retinal GS activity at 37 degrees C are optimal in retinas from 8 to 12 d embryos. This study, using cycloheximide (an inhibitor of protein synthesis) and cordycepin (an inhibitor of RNA synthesis), indicates that both protein and RNA synthesis are required for the 4 degrees C storage enhancement of GS activity. The necessary RNA synthesis occurs within the first 48 h following transfer to 37 degrees C and does not require concomitant protein synthesis. Uridine uptake, but not incorporation into trichloroacetic acid-precipitable material, is increased by initial 4 degrees C storage when compared with whole retina controls incubated at 37 degrees C for the total time. In contrast, both uptake and incorporation of amino acids are increased in 4 degrees C-stored retinas for as long as 72 h subsequent to transfer from 4 to 37 degrees C. This suggests that enhancement GS activity may arise from a combination of elevated general protein synthesis and specific messenger-RNA synthesis following 4 degrees C storage.","['Animals', 'Chick Embryo', 'Cold Temperature', 'Culture Techniques', 'Cycloheximide', 'Deoxyadenosines', 'Glutamate-Ammonia Ligase', 'Hydrocortisone', 'Kinetics', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'RNA, Messenger', 'Retina', 'Time Factors']",6207921,"[['B01.050'], ['A13.350.150', 'A16.331.200'], ['G01.906.595.272', 'G16.500.275.063.725.710.300', 'G16.500.750.775.710.300', 'N06.230.300.100.725.154', 'N06.230.300.100.725.710.300'], ['E05.481.500'], ['D03.383.621.808.240'], ['D03.633.100.759.590.138.325', 'D13.570.230.229', 'D13.570.583.138.325'], ['D08.811.464.259.200.600'], ['D04.210.500.745.745.654.600', 'D06.472.040.585.353.476', 'D06.472.040.585.478.392'], ['G01.374.661', 'G02.111.490'], ['G02.111.660.871', 'G03.734.871', 'G05.297.670'], ['D13.444.735.544'], ['A09.371.729'], ['G01.910.857']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
Bacterial contamination and septic transfusion reaction rates associated with platelet components before and after introduction of primary culture: experience at a US Academic Medical Center 1991 through 2017.,"BACKGROUND: The high incidence of septic transfusion reactions (STRs) led to testing being mandated by AABB from 2004. This was implemented by primary culture of single-donor apheresis platelets (APs) from 2004 and prestorage pooled platelets (PSPPs) from 2007.STUDY DESIGN/METHODS: Platelet (PLT) aliquots were cultured at issue and transfusion reactions evaluated at our hospital. Bacterial contamination and STR rates (shown as rates per million transfusions in Results) were evaluated before and after introduction of primary culture by blood centers that used a microbial detection system (BacT/ALERT, bioMerieux) or enhanced bacterial detection system (eBDS, Haemonetics).RESULTS: A total of 28,457 PLTs were cultured during pre-primary culture periods (44.7% APs; 55.3% at-issue pooled PLTs [AIPPs]) and 97,595 during post-primary culture periods (79.3% APs; 20.7% PSPPs). Forty-three contaminated units were identified in preculture and 34 in postculture periods (rates, 1511 vs. 348; p < 0.0001). Contamination rates of APs were significantly lower than AIPPs in the preculture (393 vs. 2415; p < 0.0001) but not postculture period compared to PSPPs (387 vs. 198; p = 0.9). STR rates (79 vs. 90; p = 0.98) were unchanged with APs but decreased considerably with pooled PLTs (826 vs. 50; p = 0.0006). Contamination (299 vs. 324; p = 0.84) and STR rates (25 vs. 116; p = 0.22) were similar for PLTs tested by BacT/ALERT and eBDS primary culture methods. A change in donor skin preparation method in 2012 was associated with decreased contamination and STR rates.CONCLUSION: Primary culture significantly reduced bacterial contamination and STR associated with pooled but not AP PLTs. Measures such as secondary testing near time of use or pathogen reduction are needed to further reduce STRs.","['Academic Medical Centers', 'Adult', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Blood Component Removal', 'Blood Platelets', 'Blood Safety', 'Blood Transfusion', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Child', 'Drug Contamination', 'History, 20th Century', 'History, 21st Century', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Platelet Transfusion', 'Primary Cell Culture', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sepsis', 'Transfusion Reaction', 'United States']",32357261,"[['N02.278.020'], ['M01.060.116'], ['C01.150.252'], ['E02.120'], ['A11.118.188', 'A15.145.229.188'], ['E02.792.833.230.500', 'E05.760.833.230.500', 'N06.850.780.200.450.325'], ['E02.095.135'], ['A11.251'], ['M01.060.406'], ['N06.850.360'], ['K01.400.504.968'], ['K01.400.504.984'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E05.318.308.985.525.375', 'N01.224.935.597.500', 'N06.850.505.400.975.525.375', 'N06.850.520.308.985.525.375'], ['E02.095.135.140.650'], ['E01.370.225.500.223.500', 'E05.200.500.265.500', 'E05.242.223.500', 'E05.481.500.249.500'], ['E05.318.372.500.500.500', 'E05.318.372.500.750.750', 'N05.715.360.330.500.500.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.825', 'N06.850.520.450.500.500.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.825'], ['C01.757', 'C23.550.470.790.500'], ['C15.378.962', 'C20.920'], ['Z01.107.567.875']]","['Health Care [N]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Humanities [K]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Geographicals [Z]']",1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1

"Tyrosine nitration in human spermatozoa: a physiological function of peroxynitrite, the reaction product of nitric oxide and superoxide.","Tyrosine nitration is a widely used marker of peroxynitrite (ONOO-) produced from the reaction of nitric oxide (NO.) with superoxide (O2(.-)). Since human spermatozoa are able to produce both NO. and O2(.-) during capacitation in vitro, we investigated whether spontaneous tyrosine nitration of proteins occurs in human spermatozoa and evaluated the physiological effects of peroxynitrite on sperm function. We report here that human spermatozoa, incubated for 8 h under conditions conducive to capacitation, display a reproducible pattern of protein tyrosine nitration. Several proteins with mol. wt of 105-14 kDa become increasingly tyrosine-nitrated after 15 min incubation and then minimal changes are observed. Treatment of capacitated spermatozoa with human follicular fluid or calcium ionophore causes an increase of the nitrotyrosine content of proteins at the mol. wt of 85 kDa. Moreover, exposure of spermatozoa to ONOO- (2.5-50 micromol/l) increases motility and primes spermatozoa to respond earlier to human follicular fluid. ONOO- also increases protein tyrosine nitration and phosphorylation in a concentration-dependent manner. Taken together, these results demonstrate that tyrosine nitration of sperm proteins occurs in capacitated human spermatozoa, and that low concentrations of ONOO- modulate sperm functions, emphasizing the concept that capacitation is part of an oxidative process.","['Calcimycin', 'Female', 'Follicular Fluid', 'Humans', 'Ionophores', 'Male', 'Nitric Oxide', 'Peroxynitrous Acid', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proteins', 'Sperm Capacitation', 'Sperm Motility', 'Spermatozoa', 'Superoxides', 'Tyrosine']",11574660,"[['D03.633.100.221.173'], ['A05.360.319.114.630.535.150', 'A06.300.312.497.535.150', 'A12.207.270.340'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D27.505.519.562.374', 'D27.720.395'], ['D01.339.387', 'D01.625.550.500', 'D01.625.700.500', 'D01.650.550.587.600'], ['D01.625.600.800', 'D01.625.700.750'], ['G02.111.665', 'G02.607.780', 'G03.796'], ['D12.776'], ['G08.686.784.277.760'], ['E01.370.225.992.812', 'E05.200.992.812', 'G04.198.750'], ['A05.360.490.890', 'A11.497.760'], ['D01.248.497.158.685.750.850', 'D01.339.431.374.850', 'D01.650.550.750.800', 'D02.389.338.732'], ['D12.125.072.050.875']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Norepinephrine release in the amygdala after systemic injection of epinephrine or escapable footshock: contribution of the nucleus of the solitary tract.,"Several findings based largely on lesions and drug manipulations within the amygdala suggest that norepinephrine (NE) systems in the amygdala contribute to enhancement of memory processes by epinephrine (EPI). However, no studies to date have directly measured changes in the release of NE in the amygdala after EPI injection. In Experiment 1, in vivo microdialysis was used to assess amygdala NE release after systemic injection of saline, EPI (0.1 or 0.3 mg/kg), and administration of an escapable footshock (0.8 mA, 1 s). Both doses of EPI produced a significant elevation in NE release that persisted for up to 60 min. In Experiment 2, the local anesthetic lidocaine (2%) was infused (0.5 microl) into the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) immediately before injection of 0.3 mg/kg EPI. The EPI-induced elevation in amygdala NE release observed in Experiment I was attenuated by inactivation of the NTS. These findings indicate that systemic injection of EPI increases release of NE in the amygdala and suggest that the effects are mediated in part by activation of brainstem neurons in the NTS that project to the amygdala.","['Amygdala', 'Animals', 'Arousal', 'Avoidance Learning', 'Brain Mapping', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Fear', 'Injections', 'Lidocaine', 'Male', 'Neural Pathways', 'Norepinephrine', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Solitary Nucleus']",9926823,"[['A08.186.211.180.090', 'A08.186.211.200.885.287.249.152'], ['B01.050'], ['F02.830.104', 'G11.561.035'], ['F02.463.425.097', 'F02.463.785.373.173'], ['E01.370.350.578.875.500', 'E01.370.376.537.625.500', 'E05.629.875.500'], ['G07.690.773.875', 'G07.690.936.500'], ['F01.470.361'], ['E02.319.267.530'], ['D02.065.199.092.500', 'D02.092.146.113.092.500'], ['A08.612'], ['D02.033.100.291.502', 'D02.092.063.480', 'D02.092.211.215.746', 'D02.092.311.830', 'D02.455.426.559.389.657.166.175.830'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700.750'], ['A08.186.211.132.810.591.500.750']]","['Anatomy [A]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]']",1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Interpretation of postvagotomy endoscopic Congo red test results in relation to ulcer recurrence 5 to 12 years after operation.,"BACKGROUND: The aim of the present study was to estimate, after vagotomy, the location and extension of residual vagal innervation of the gastric corpus mucosa by using the endoscopic Congo red test (ECRT) and its relation to recurrent ulcer (RU), as well as the results of quantitative gastric acid tests: basal acid output (BAO), maximal acid output (MAO), and nocturnal acid output (NAO).METHODS: A total of 271 consecutive vagotomized duodenal ulcer (DU) patients were studied 5 to 12 years (mean 8 years) after the operation. In all cases gastroscopy and ECRT were performed simultaneously. ECRT was considered positive if a red to black-blue (pH <3.0) color change of the gastric corpus mucosa occurred within the first 3 minutes, and the cases were classified as having small extension (SE), ie, one or more areas with a diameter of 1 to 30 mm, or large extension (LE), ie, 20% or more of the gastric corpus showing residual vagal innervation. No red to black-blue changes (pH >3.0) were attributed to negative ECRT. BAO, MAO, and NAO were determined preoperatively and postoperatively in 108 cases out of 271 and correspond with ECRT results.RESULTS: Recurrent ulcer occurred in 18 out of 135 ECRT-positive and in 1 out of 136 ECRT-negative cases. RU occurred 5 times more frequently in LE than SE cases (P <0.05). The postoperative mean values of BAO, MAO, and NAO were significantly higher in ECRT-positive than in ECRT-negative cases (P <0.001), and higher in LE than in SE cases (P <0.01; for NAO, P >0.05).CONCLUSION: ECRT is a practical and reliable method in the evaluation of postvagotomy DU patients: Negative ECRT practically includes recurrent ulcer risk; positive ECRT of large extension is related to fivefold higher recurrent ulcer risk compared with ECRT of small extension; and ECRT reflects BAO, MAO, and NAO results and can be used instead of them as a less time-consuming procedure, which is more convenient for the patient.","['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Congo Red', 'Duodenal Ulcer', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Gastric Acid', 'Gastric Mucosa', 'Gastroscopy', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Recurrence', 'Risk Factors', 'Staining and Labeling', 'Vagotomy']",9645775,"[['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['M01.060.116.100.080'], ['D02.455.426.559.847.638.555.300', 'D02.886.645.600.080.050.650.250', 'D04.615.638.555.300'], ['C06.405.469.275.800.348', 'C06.405.748.586.349'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.249', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.350', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.350'], ['A12.200.307.603'], ['A03.556.875.875.440', 'A10.615.550.291'], ['E01.370.372.250.250.325', 'E01.370.388.250.250.250.320', 'E04.210.240.250.320', 'E04.502.250.250.250.320'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['C23.550.291.937'], ['E05.318.740.600.800.725', 'N05.715.350.200.700', 'N05.715.360.750.625.700.700', 'N06.850.490.625.750', 'N06.850.520.830.600.800.725'], ['E01.370.225.500.620.670', 'E01.370.225.750.600.670', 'E05.200.500.620.670', 'E05.200.750.600.670'], ['E04.525.210.105.600.850']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Organisms [B]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0

Ischaemic stroke after exposure to aflibercept: interaction with vitamin K antagonist and/or direct pharmacodynamic effect?,"WHAT IS KNOWN AND OBJECTIVE: Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) proteins are involved in the regulation of vascular endothelium, and their inhibition led to the development of a number of drugs used for malignancies or exudative neo-vascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD).CASE SUMMARY: We report a case of ischemic stroke in an 87-year-old woman having received intravitreal aflibercept, a new anti-VEGF for AMD. She had been treated with ranibizumab since 2007. In 2013, ranibizumab was replaced with aflibercept, followed by a decrease in the International Normalized Ratio, complicated by a stroke a few days later. The rechallenge was positive.WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION: A potential time-dependent interaction between aflibercept and VKA antagonist and/or a direct effect of aflibercept may have contributed to the occurrence of the ischaemic stroke. Currently available data suggest some pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic effects of aflibercept by explaining its pro-thrombotic profile.","['Anticoagulants', 'Drug Interactions', 'Female', 'Humans', 'International Normalized Ratio', 'Intravitreal Injections', 'Macular Degeneration', 'Ranibizumab', 'Receptors, Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins', 'Stroke', 'Time Factors', 'Vitamin K']",25930164,"[['D27.505.954.502.119'], ['G07.690.773.968'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E01.370.225.625.115.320', 'E05.200.625.115.320'], ['E02.319.267.530.475.500'], ['C11.768.585.439'], ['D12.776.124.486.485.114.224.060.868', 'D12.776.124.790.651.114.224.060.868', 'D12.776.377.715.548.114.224.200.868'], ['D08.811.913.696.620.682.725.400.950', 'D12.776.543.750.630.750', 'D12.776.543.750.750.400.910'], ['D12.776.828.300'], ['C10.228.140.300.775', 'C14.907.253.855'], ['G01.910.857'], ['D02.455.426.559.847.638.721.374', 'D02.455.849.291.523.500', 'D04.615.638.721.374']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Diseases [C]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Improving diabetes care and outcomes in a rural primary care clinic.,"BACKGROUND: Data have shown that despite the availability of a wide variety of treatment approaches to normalize plasma glucose, the great majority of diabetic patients remain poorly controlled. The goal of a small, rural health care organization that included a critical access hospital and a 25-provider physician group was to improve glycated hemoglobin (A1C) outcomes among patients with Type 2 diabetes and to improve frequency of testing (A1C) levels. IMPLEMENTING THE IMPROVEMENT INITIATIVE: Academic detailing in practice guidelines with algorithms for care and a diabetes self-management education program were the first key activities in the improvement initiative. A variety of performance improvement activities were implemented. A diabetes care flow sheet was used to monitor and report process and outcome measurements. A diabetes registry to enter process and outcome data was introduced; data can be displayed by specific provider, by the organization as a whole, by patients whose A1C is > 7, and by patients who have not had an A1C in the last six months. The diabetes care team includes the patient, the primary care provider who provides medical management, and the diabetes educators (pharmacist and dietitian).RESULTS: As of December 2005, hemoglobin A1C levels averaged 6.7 for the 566 patients in the registry.DISCUSSION: The greatest barrier to implementing the initiative lies in the challenge of trying to provide chronic care in an acute care medical model.","['Ambulatory Care Facilities', 'Awards and Prizes', 'Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2', 'Glycated Hemoglobin A', 'Hospitals, Rural', 'Humans', 'Multi-Institutional Systems', 'Outcome Assessment, Health Care', 'Practice Guidelines as Topic', 'Primary Health Care', 'Quality Assurance, Health Care', 'Self Care', 'Wisconsin']",16761788,"[['N02.278.035'], ['K01.150'], ['C18.452.394.750.149', 'C19.246.300'], ['D09.400.430.937', 'D12.776.124.400.405.440', 'D12.776.395.381', 'D12.776.422.316.762.380.440'], ['N02.278.421.518'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['N04.452.540'], ['H01.770.644.145.431', 'N04.761.559.590', 'N05.715.360.575.575'], ['N04.761.700.350.650', 'N05.700.350.650'], ['N04.590.233.727'], ['N04.761.700', 'N05.700'], ['E02.900', 'I03.050.563', 'N02.421.784.680'], ['Z01.107.567.875.350.900', 'Z01.107.567.875.510.900']]","['Health Care [N]', 'Humanities [K]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Geographicals [Z]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1
Liver disease in Felty's syndrome.,"Eighteen patients with Felty's syndrome were examined prospectively for the presence of hepatic abnormalities. Twelve patients had abnormal liver histologic features: five with nodular regenerative hyperplasia and seven with portal fibrosis or abnormal lobular architecture. Only seven of the 12 had abnormal liver chemistry results. Four of the 12 had portal hypertension, and three bled from esophageal varices compared with one of six with normal histologic features. When patients with normal and abnormal liver histologic findings were compared, there was no difference in clinical, serologic, or extra-articular manifestations between the two groups, although there was a tendency for the patients with abnormal findings to have a higher incidence of vasculopathy. All patients with Felty's syndrome should be screened for hepatic abnormalities and portal hypertension as they have an increased likelihood of bleeding from esophageal varices.","['Adult', 'Aged', 'Biopsy, Needle', 'Felty Syndrome', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hyperplasia', 'Liver Diseases', 'Liver Function Tests', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective Studies']",7091172,"[['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['E01.370.225.500.384.100.119', 'E01.370.225.998.054.119', 'E01.370.388.100.100', 'E04.074.119', 'E04.665.100', 'E05.200.500.384.100.119', 'E05.200.998.054.119', 'E05.242.384.100.119'], ['C05.550.114.154.389', 'C05.799.114.389', 'C17.300.775.099.389', 'C20.111.199.389'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C23.550.444'], ['C06.552'], ['E01.370.372.460'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['E01.789'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.625', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.650', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.650']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Health Care [N]']",0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
Quantifying remediation effectiveness under variable external forcing using contaminant rating curves.,"Remediation efforts are typically assessed through before-and-after comparisons of contaminant concentrations or loads. These comparisons can be misleading when external drivers, such as weather conditions, differ between the pre- and postremediation monitoring periods. Here, we show that remediation effectiveness may be better assessed by comparing pre- and postremediation contaminant rating curves, which permit ""all else equal"" comparisons of pre- and postremediation contaminant concentrations and loads under at any specified external forcing. We illustrate this approach with a remediation case study at an abandoned mercury mine in Northern California. Measured mercury loads in the stream draining the mine site were a factor of 1000 smaller after the remediation than before, superficially suggesting that the cleanup was 99.9% effective, but rainstorms were weaker and less frequent during the postremediation monitoring period. Our analysis shows that this difference in weather conditions alone reduced mercury loads at our site by a factor of 73-85, with a further factor of 12.6-14.5 being attributable to the remediation itself, implying that the cleanup was 92-93% (rather than 99.9%) effective. Our results illustrate the need to account for external confounding drivers when assessing remediation efforts, particularly in systems with highly episodic forcing.","['California', 'Environmental Monitoring', 'Environmental Restoration and Remediation', 'Geologic Sediments', 'Mercury', 'Mining', 'Nephelometry and Turbidimetry', 'Rain', 'Water Pollutants, Chemical']",21827186,"[['Z01.107.567.875.580.200', 'Z01.107.567.875.760.200'], ['N06.850.460.350.080', 'N06.850.780.375'], ['N06.230.080.600', 'N06.850.460.375'], ['G01.311.330', 'G16.500.320'], ['D01.268.556.504', 'D01.268.956.437', 'D01.552.544.504'], ['J01.576.655.875.500'], ['E05.196.712.650'], ['G16.500.175.859', 'G16.500.275.063.725.395', 'G16.500.750.775.450', 'N06.230.300.100.725.450', 'N06.230.520'], ['D27.888.284.903.655']]","['Geographicals [Z]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1
The mechanism of inhibition by H2 of H2-evolution by hydrogenases.,"By analysing the results of experiments carried out with two FeFe hydrogenases and several ""channel mutants"" of a NiFe hydrogenase, we demonstrate that whether or not hydrogen evolution is significantly inhibited by H2 is not a consequence of active site chemistry, but rather relates to H2 transport within the enzyme.","['Hydrogen', 'Hydrogenase', 'Iron-Sulfur Proteins', 'Models, Molecular']",23792933,"[['D01.268.406', 'D01.362.340'], ['D08.811.682.400'], ['D12.776.157.427.374.375', 'D12.776.556.579.374.375'], ['E05.599.595']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Fluorofenidone attenuates bleomycin-induced pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis in mice via restoring caveolin 1 expression and inhibiting mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway.,"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is a progressive, life-threatening, interstitial lung disease with no effective therapy. In this study, we evaluated the effects of fluorofenidone (FD), a novel pyridone agent, on a murine model of bleomycin-induced pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis. Institute for Cancer Research mice were intravenously injected with BLM or saline for 14 consecutive days. Fluorofenidone, pirfenidone (500 mg · kg · d, respectively), or vehicle was administered throughout the course of the experiment. Animals were killed on day 28, and various parameters reflecting pulmonary vascular permeability, influx of inflammatory cells, and levels of transforming growth factor â in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid were assessed. Collagen I, á-smooth muscle actin, and fibronectin were measured by real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction or Western blot. Furthermore, caveolin 1 and activation of P38, extracellular signal-regulated kinase, and c-Jun N-terminal kinase were detected by Western blot. Fluorofenidone treatment significantly attenuated the increased pulmonary damage index score, the levels of proteins, transforming growth factor â, and the influx of cells in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Fluorofenidone also markedly reduced the expression of fibronectin, á-smooth muscle actin, and collagen I in mouse lung tissues. Inversely, FD restored caveolin 1 protein and mRNA expression, which was significantly downregulated in BLM-induced lung fibrosis. Fluorofenidone also inhibited phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase, P38, and c-Jun N-terminal kinase. These findings collectively suggest that FD is an effective agent with antifibrotic and anti-inflammatory properties, and the mechanisms of its antifibrotic effect include regulating caveolin 1 expression and blocking mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathways.","['Actins', 'Animals', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic', 'Bleomycin', 'Bronchoalveolar Lavage', 'Capillary Permeability', 'Caveolin 1', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Fibronectins', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred ICR', 'Phosphorylation', 'Pneumonia', 'Pyridones', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases']",23042199,"[['D05.750.078.730.250', 'D12.776.210.500.100', 'D12.776.220.525.255'], ['B01.050'], ['D27.505.954.248.106'], ['D09.400.420.110', 'D12.644.233.110'], ['E05.927.100'], ['G03.143.330', 'G09.330.165'], ['D12.644.360.024.264', 'D12.776.157.057.010', 'D12.776.476.024.280', 'D12.776.543.990.100.500', 'D12.776.744.287'], ['G02.111.263', 'G03.328'], ['D12.776.377.715.390', 'D12.776.395.550.350', 'D12.776.543.550.350', 'D12.776.860.300.450'], ['G05.308'], ['C08.381.765.500'], ['D08.811.913.696.620.682.700.567.374', 'D12.644.360.450.340', 'D12.776.476.450.340'], ['G02.111.820.560', 'G03.493.560', 'G04.835.560'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500'], ['B01.050.050.199.520.520.510', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500.400.510'], ['G02.111.665', 'G02.607.780', 'G03.796'], ['C01.748.610', 'C08.381.677', 'C08.730.610'], ['D03.383.725.791'], ['D08.811.913.696.620.682.700.567.843', 'D12.644.360.450.835', 'D12.776.476.450.835']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Diseases [C]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Tailoring treatment for ductal intraepithelial neoplasia of the breast according to Ki-67 and molecular phenotype.,"BACKGROUND: The post-surgical management of ductal intraepithelial neoplasia (DIN) of the breast is still a dilemma. Ki-67 labelling index (LI) has been proposed as an independent predictive and prognostic factor in early breast cancer.METHODS: The prognostic and predictive roles of Ki-67 LI were evaluated with a multivariable Cox regression model in a cohort of 1171 consecutive patients operated for DIN in a single institution from 1997 to 2007.RESULTS: Radiotherapy (RT) was protective in subjects with DIN with Ki-67 LI ? 14%, whereas no evidence of benefit was seen for Ki-67 LI <14%, irrespective of nuclear grade and presence of necrosis. Notably, the higher the Ki-67 LI, the stronger the effect of RT (P-interaction <0.01). Hormonal therapy (HT) was effective in both Luminal A (adjusted hazard ratio (HR)=0.56 (95% CI, 0.33-0.97)) and Luminal B/Her2neg DIN (HR 0.51 (95% CI, 0.27-0.95)).CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that Ki-67 LI may be a useful prognostic and predictive adjunct in DIN patients. The Ki-67 LI of 14% could be a potential cutoff for better categorising this population of women at increased risk for breast cancer and in which adjuvant treatment (RT, HT) should be differently addressed, independent of histological grade and presence of necrosis.","['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal', 'Breast Neoplasms', 'Carcinoma in Situ', 'Carcinoma, Ductal, Breast', 'Carcinoma, Intraductal, Noninfiltrating', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Ki-67 Antigen', 'Middle Aged', 'Phenotype', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Radiotherapy, Adjuvant', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Tamoxifen']",23579208,"[['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['D27.505.954.248.169'], ['C04.588.180', 'C17.800.090.500'], ['C04.557.470.200.240'], ['C04.557.470.200.025.232.500', 'C04.557.470.615.132.500', 'C04.588.180.390', 'C17.800.090.500.390'], ['C04.557.470.200.025.275', 'C04.557.470.200.240.187.250', 'C04.557.470.615.275'], ['E05.318.372.500.750', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E01.370.225.500.607.512', 'E01.370.225.750.551.512', 'E05.200.500.607.512', 'E05.200.750.551.512', 'E05.478.583', 'H01.158.100.656.234.512', 'H01.158.201.344.512', 'H01.158.201.486.512', 'H01.181.122.573.512', 'H01.181.122.605.512'], ['D12.776.660.625.500', 'D23.050.290.500', 'D23.101.140.400'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['G05.695'], ['E05.318.370.800.650', 'N05.715.360.325.700.640', 'N06.850.520.445.800.650'], ['E05.318.740.500.700', 'E05.318.740.600.700', 'E05.318.740.750.725', 'E05.318.740.998.825', 'E05.599.835.900', 'N05.715.360.750.530.650', 'N05.715.360.750.625.650', 'N05.715.360.750.695.650', 'N05.715.360.750.795.825', 'N06.850.520.830.500.700', 'N06.850.520.830.600.700', 'N06.850.520.830.750.725', 'N06.850.520.830.998.912'], ['E02.186.775', 'E02.815.600'], ['E05.318.372.500.500.500', 'E05.318.372.500.750.750', 'N05.715.360.330.500.500.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.825', 'N06.850.520.450.500.500.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.825'], ['D02.455.426.559.389.150.700.900']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0
"Historical consequences of the infertility of Otto (1815-67) and Amelia (1818-75), first Royal couple of Greece.","After the Greek Independence (1830), the first King, Otto from the Wittelsbach dynasty (Bayer), was married to Amelia from the House of Oldenburg (1836). Their failure to produce an heir to the throne, eagerly expected by the people, contributed much to their abdication in 1862, as an additional factor at the general, opposition to their way of governing. The responsibility for the couples sterility became a matter of political controversies among their families, their countries and the other European thrones after the unsuccessful medical diagnoses and treatments of the most eminent Greek and German physicians. This paper examines their failure to continue the throne, the medical circumstances, and the historical and political consequences.","['Famous Persons', 'Female', 'Government', 'Greece', 'History, 19th Century', 'Humans', 'Infertility', 'Male']",21350083,"[['K01.517.211.506', 'M01.228'], ['I01.409', 'N03.540.348'], ['Z01.542.383'], ['K01.400.504.937'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C12.294.365', 'C13.351.500.365']]","['Humanities [K]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]']",0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1
"Multiplex fluorescence in situ hybridization identifies novel rearrangements of chromosomes 6, 15, and 18 in primary uveal melanoma.","Uveal melanomas are the commonest ocular tumour of adults and are characterized by reproducible alterations of chromosomes 1, 3, 6 and 8. These alterations are of prognostic relevance and have also be shown to correlate to high risk and low risk metastatic categories of uveal melanoma as defined by micro-array analysis. It is, however, possible that a catalogue of relevant genetic alterations, involving gene rearrangement rather than amplification, have as yet eluded identification. To address this point we examined 14 primary uveal melanomas, using 24 colour multiplex fluorescence in situ hybridization (M-FISH). All tumours were karyotyped following G-Banding, and M-FISH was performed to confirm and clarify the identity of abnormal chromosomes. M-FISH data were obtained from all tumours and was able to establish the nature of most abnormalities not fully characterized by cytogenetics. Abnormalities of chromosome 6 were far more frequent than previously indicated, in approximately 70% of cases, indicating they have been substantially underrepresented in past studies of uveal melanoma. Spindle melanomas were found to have novel rearrangements affecting in particular chromosomes 6, 15 and 18, suggesting that juxtaposition of genes through translocational events may play a role in the development of some uveal melanomas. In conclusion, this study is the largest of primary uveal melanoma analysed by M-FISH and indicates that alterations of chromosome 6 have previously been underestimated. Furthermore spindle melanomas are prone to rearrangements affecting chromosomes 6, 15 and 18, which may relate to early changes in uveal melanoma development or associate with those melanomas of a more differentiated status.","['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 15', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 18', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 6', 'Cohort Studies', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Male', 'Melanoma', 'Middle Aged', 'Uveal Neoplasms']",16684523,"[['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['M01.060.116.100.080'], ['C23.550.210', 'G05.365.590.175'], ['A11.284.187.520.300.370.385', 'G05.360.162.520.300.370.385'], ['A11.284.187.520.300.415.430', 'G05.360.162.520.300.415.430'], ['A11.284.187.520.300.325.330', 'G05.360.162.520.300.325.330'], ['E05.318.372.500.750', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750'], ['E01.370.225.500.385', 'E05.200.500.385', 'E05.242.385', 'E05.393.285'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E01.370.225.500.620.670.325.350', 'E01.370.225.750.600.670.325.350', 'E05.200.500.620.670.325.350', 'E05.200.750.600.670.325.350', 'E05.393.285.350', 'E05.393.661.475.350'], ['C04.557.465.625.650.510', 'C04.557.580.625.650.510', 'C04.557.665.510'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['C04.588.364.978', 'C11.319.494', 'C11.941.855']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]']",1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
[Histologic regression of localized prostatic tumor with neoadjuvant hormonal therapy].,"OBJECTIVES: To determine the usefulness of preoperative hormone therapy in patients with organ-confined prostatic carcinoma undergoing radical prostatectomy.METHODS: 7 patients with localized prostatic carcinoma are presented. All patients were submitted to radical prostatectomy; 4 had been randomly selected for preoperative hormone therapy.RESULTS: Histological examination showed no nodal involvement in all cases. The tumor could not be identified (Po) in two of the four patients who received hormone therapy. The other two patients were staged down; the Gleason score remained unchanged in one and increased in the other. The patients who did not receive preoperative hormone therapy showed concordant clinical and pathological stages, except one in whom infiltration of the prostatic capsule was observed. No difference was found concerning the facility in performing surgery between the treated and untreated patients.CONCLUSIONS: Hormonal deprivation eliminated the tumor burden in two cases that might have been completely hormone sensitive, with no correlation in the pretreatment histological grade. Clinical downstaging is achieved by this treatment modality. However, further studies in larger series comparing the percentages of downstaging, histological downgrading, absence of tumor cells in the surgical specimen and impact on survivorship are warranted.","['Adenocarcinoma', 'Aged', 'Androgen Antagonists', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Flutamide', 'Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prostatectomy', 'Prostatic Neoplasms', 'Remission Induction']",9065279,"[['C04.557.470.200.025'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['D06.347.065', 'D27.505.696.399.450.065'], ['E02.186'], ['D02.065.199.420', 'D02.092.146.113.420'], ['D06.472.699.327.740.320', 'D12.644.400.400.740.320', 'D12.644.456.460', 'D12.644.548.365.740.320', 'D12.776.631.650.405.740.320'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['E04.950.774.860.625'], ['C04.588.945.440.770', 'C12.294.260.750', 'C12.294.565.625', 'C12.758.409.750'], ['E02.860']]","['Diseases [C]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
Aggressive bladder carcinoma in an HIV-positive man with tetraplegia and neurogenic bladder.,"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: Patients with neurogenic bladder secondary to spinal cord injury who are managed long term with an indwelling catheter are known to be at increased risk for transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder. Immunosuppression is a known risk factor for malignancies that often are more aggresSive than those seen in normal populations.METHOD: Case report and discussion of management recommendations.RESULTS: We summarize the case of a 44-year-old HIV-positive C5-C6 incomplete tetraplegic male (date of injury 1980), who was diagnosed with transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder and succumbed to disease within 6 months of diagnosis. The patient was a non-smoker who was never managed with an indwelling catheter. There has been no such case reported in the literature.CONCLUSIONS: HIV infection in the presence of a neurogenic bladder may carry an increased risk of aggressive bladder malignancy. More studies are warranted to determine whether routine annual screening with cystoscopy in all patients with HIV and neurogenic bladder is indicated.","['Adult', 'Carcinoma', 'HIV Seropositivity', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Quadriplegia', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed', 'Urinary Bladder Neoplasms', 'Urinary Bladder, Neurogenic']",21675364,"[['M01.060.116'], ['C04.557.470.200'], ['C01.221.250.875.500', 'C01.221.812.640.400.500', 'C01.778.640.400.500', 'C01.925.782.815.616.400.500', 'C01.925.813.400.500', 'C20.673.480.500'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C10.597.622.760', 'C23.888.592.636.786'], ['E01.370.350.350.810', 'E01.370.350.600.350.700.810', 'E01.370.350.700.700.810', 'E01.370.350.700.810.810', 'E01.370.350.825.810.810'], ['C04.588.945.947.960', 'C12.758.820.968', 'C12.777.829.813', 'C13.351.937.820.945', 'C13.351.968.829.707'], ['C10.597.900', 'C12.777.829.839', 'C13.351.968.829.760', 'C23.888.592.900']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
Effect of macrophage migration inhibitory factor on corneal sensitivity after laser in situ keratomileusis in rabbit.,"PURPOSE: To investigate the effect of macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) on corneal sensitivity after laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK) surgery.METHODS: New Zealand white rabbits were used in this study. A hinged corneal flap (160-µm thick) was created with a microkeratome, and -3.0 diopter excimer laser ablation was performed. Expressions of MIF mRNA in the corneal epithelial cells and surrounding inflammatory cells were analyzed using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction at 48 hours after LASIK. After LASIK surgery, the rabbits were topically given either 1) a balanced salt solution (BSS), 2) MIF (100 ng/mL) alone, or 3) a combination of nerve growth factor (NGF, 100 ug/mL), neurotrophine-3 (NT-3, 100 ng/mL), interleukin-6 (IL-6, 5 ng/mL), and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF, 5 ng/mL) four times a day for three days. Preoperative and postoperative corneal sensitivity at two weeks and at 10 weeks were assessed using the Cochet-Bonnet esthesiometer.RESULTS: Expression of MIF mRNA was 2.5-fold upregulated in the corneal epithelium and 1.5-fold upregulated in the surrounding inflammatory cells as compared with the control eyes. Preoperative baseline corneal sensitivity was 40.56 ± 2.36 mm. At two weeks after LASIK, corneal sensitivity was 9.17 ± 5.57 mm in the BSS treated group, 21.92 ± 2.44 mm in the MIF treated group, and 22.42 ± 1.59 mm in the neuronal growth factors-treated group (MIF vs. BSS, p < 0.0001; neuronal growth factors vs. BSS, p < 0.0001; MIF vs. neuronal growth factors, p = 0.815). At 10 weeks after LASIK, corneal sensitivity was 15.00 ± 9.65, 35.00 ± 5.48, and 29.58 ± 4.31 mm respectively (MIF vs. BSS, p = 0.0001; neuronal growth factors vs. BSS, p = 0.002; MIF vs. neuronal growth factors, p = 0.192). Treatment with MIF alone could achieve as much of an effect on recovery of corneal sensation as treatment with combination of NGF, NT-3, IL-6, and LIF.CONCLUSIONS: Topically administered MIF plays a significant role in the early recovery of corneal sensitivity after LASIK in the experimental animal model.","['Animals', 'Epithelium, Corneal', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6', 'Keratomileusis, Laser In Situ', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Macrophage Migration-Inhibitory Factors', 'Models, Animal', 'Nerve Growth Factor', 'Nerve Regeneration', 'Neurotrophin 3', 'RNA, Messenger', 'Rabbits', 'Recovery of Function', 'Sensation']",24688261,"[['B01.050'], ['A09.371.060.217.325', 'A10.272.510'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D12.644.276.374.465.224', 'D12.776.467.374.465.202', 'D23.529.374.465.224'], ['E02.594.480.750', 'E04.014.520.480.750', 'E04.378.500.750', 'E04.540.825.437.374'], ['D12.644.276.374.470', 'D12.776.467.374.470', 'D23.529.374.470'], ['D12.644.276.374.480.625', 'D12.776.467.374.480.625', 'D23.125.477.500', 'D23.529.374.480.625'], ['E05.598'], ['D12.644.276.860.437', 'D12.776.467.860.437', 'D12.776.631.600.437', 'D23.529.850.437'], ['G11.561.585', 'G16.762.611'], ['D12.644.276.860.775', 'D12.776.467.860.775', 'D12.776.631.600.775', 'D23.529.850.775'], ['D13.444.735.544'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.968.700'], ['G16.757'], ['F02.830.816', 'G11.561.790']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]']",1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
The prognosis of melanoma patients with metastases to two or more lymph node areas.,"The prognosis of melanoma patients who present with metastatic involvement of two or more noncontiguous lymph node regions before the detection of extranodal metastases has not been previously reported. We identified 21 patients with metastatic melanoma in at least two nodal basins in a review of 175 patients with melanoma undergoing lymphadenectomy at the National Cancer Institute. The median survival time of these patients was 46 months, with 55%, 27%, and 17% of the patients alive 2, 5, and 10 years, respectively, after the second lymphadenectomy. Because the prognosis of melanoma patients with metastases to two or more regional nodal areas appears equivalent to that of patients with metastatic involvement of only one regional node site, lymphadenectomy of the involved groups should be performed with therapeutically curative intent.","['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'BCG Vaccine', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Dacarbazine', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy', 'Lomustine', 'Lymph Node Excision', 'Lymphatic Metastasis', 'Male', 'Melanoma', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness', 'Prognosis', 'Skin Neoplasms', 'Survival Rate']",1867519,"[['M01.060.057'], ['M01.060.116'], ['D20.215.894.135.825.100'], ['E02.186'], ['D02.925.200', 'D03.383.129.308.240'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E02.095.465.425'], ['D02.065.950.594.440', 'D02.654.692.440'], ['E04.446'], ['C04.697.650.560', 'C23.550.727.650.560'], ['C04.557.465.625.650.510', 'C04.557.580.625.650.510', 'C04.557.665.510'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['C04.697.645', 'C23.550.727.645'], ['E01.789'], ['C04.588.805', 'C17.800.882'], ['E05.318.308.985.550.900', 'N01.224.935.698.826', 'N06.850.505.400.975.550.900', 'N06.850.520.308.985.550.900']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Health Care [N]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
In vivo monitoring of extracellular glutamate in the brain with a microsensor.,"Recent discoveries have revealed that glutamatergic neurotransmission in the central nervous system is mediated by a dynamic interplay between neurons and astrocytes. To enhance our understanding of this process, the study of extracellular glutamate is crucial. At present, microdialysis is the most frequently used analytical technique to monitor extracellular glutamate levels directly in the brain. However, the neuronal and physiological origin of the detected glutamate levels is questioned as they do not fulfil the classical release criteria for exocytotic release, such as calcium dependency or response to the sodium channel blocker tetrodotoxine (TTX). It is hypothesized that an analytical technique with a higher spatial and temporal resolution is required. Glutamate microsensors provide a promising analytical solution to meet this requirement. In the present study, we applied a 10 micro m diameter hydrogel-coated glutamate microsensor to monitor extracellular glutamate levels in the striatum of anesthetized rats. To explore the potential of the microsensor, different pharmacological agents were injected in the vicinity of the sensor at an approximate distance of 100 micro m. It was observed that KCl, exogenous glutamate, kainate and the reuptake inhibitor DL-threo-beta-benzyloxyaspartate (DL-TBOA) increased the extracellular glutamate levels significantly. TTX decreased the basal extracellular glutamate levels approximately 90%, which indicates that the microsensor is capable of detecting neuronally derived glutamate. This is one of the first studies in which a microsensor is applied in vivo on a routine base, and it is concluded that microsensor research can contribute significantly to improve our understanding of the physiology of glutamatergic neurotransmission in the brain.","['Animals', 'Aspartic Acid', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'Down-Regulation', 'Excitatory Amino Acid Agonists', 'Extracellular Fluid', 'Glutamic Acid', 'Hydrogel, Polyethylene Glycol Dimethacrylate', 'Male', 'Microelectrodes', 'Molecular Probe Techniques', 'Neurochemistry', 'Potassium Chloride', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar', 'Sodium Channel Blockers']",16956598,"[['B01.050'], ['D12.125.067.500', 'D12.125.119.170', 'D12.125.427.040'], ['E05.091'], ['A08.186.211'], ['G02.111.240', 'G05.308.200', 'G07.690.773.937'], ['D27.505.519.625.190.200', 'D27.505.696.577.190.200'], ['A11.284.295.260', 'A12.207.270'], ['D12.125.067.625.349', 'D12.125.119.409.349', 'D12.125.427.300'], ['D02.033.455.250.700.485', 'D05.750.219.500', 'D05.750.741.485', 'D20.280.320.609.500', 'D25.720.532.500', 'D25.720.741.485', 'D26.255.165.320.375.375', 'J01.637.051.720.584.500', 'J01.637.051.720.741.485'], ['E07.305.250.500'], ['E05.601'], ['H01.158.201.687', 'H01.158.610.110', 'H01.181.122.709'], ['D01.210.450.150.750', 'D01.745.625'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700.900'], ['D27.505.519.562.750', 'D27.505.954.411.720']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0
A microsatellite genetic linkage map of human chromosome 18.,"We isolated nine new microsatellite markers from chromosome 18 and further characterized and mapped eight microsatellites developed in other laboratories. We have constructed a framework linkage map of chromosome 18 that includes 14 microsatellite markers (12 dinucleotide and 2 tetranucleotide) and 2 RFLP markers. Cytogenetic localization for the microsatellites was performed by PCR amplification of 18 somatic cell hybrids containing different deletions of chromosome 18. Twelve of the microsatellites and one of the RFLPs have heterozygosites greater than 70%. The average heterozygosity of the markers included in the map is 72%. In addition, we have made provisional placements of 3 more microsatellite markers and 2 more RFLP markers. The map lengths (in Kosambi centimorgans) are as follows: sex-averaged, 109.3 cM; male, 72.4 cM; female, 161.2 cM. The average distance between markers in the sex-averaged map is 7.3 cM, and the largest gap between markers is 16.7 cM. Analysis of the data for differences in the female:male map distance ratio revealed significant evidence for a constant difference in the ratio (chi 2 = 32.25; df = 1; P < 0.001; ratio = 2.5:1). Furthermore, there was significant evidence in favor of a variable female:male map distance ratio across the chromosome compared to a constant distance ratio (chi 2 = 27.78; df = 14; P = 0.015). To facilitate their use in genomic screening for disease genes, all of the microsatellite markers used here can be amplified under standard PCR conditions, and most can be used in duplex PCR reactions.","['Base Sequence', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 18', 'DNA, Satellite', 'Female', 'Genetic Linkage', 'Heterozygote', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length', 'Recombination, Genetic', 'Sex Characteristics']",8094374,"[['G02.111.570.080', 'G05.360.080', 'L01.453.245.667.080'], ['A11.284.187.520.300.415.430', 'G05.360.162.520.300.415.430'], ['D13.444.308.480', 'G02.111.570.080.708.800.150', 'G05.360.080.708.800.150', 'G05.360.340.024.220.150', 'G05.360.340.024.850.150'], ['G05.348'], ['G05.380.383'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['L01.453.245.667'], ['G05.365.590'], ['E05.393.620.500'], ['G05.365.795.595'], ['G05.728'], ['G08.686.815']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
Tissue distribution and urinary excretion of 14C-ethion in goats.,"Tissue concentration and elimination and urinary excretion were followed after intravenous injection of 14C-ethion in 12 goats. Tissue levels were determined in two goats after 8 hr and on each of days 1, 3, 7, 14 and 28 after exposure. During the four-week period plasma and all tissues examined (liver, kidney, fat, muscle, lung, heart and brain) had detectable 14C-residues, the highest values being found in liver, kidney and fat. Elimination of 14C-residues was faster in the first 3 days than in the later part of the experiment, where the elimination half-life for most tissues was approximately 2 weeks. During the first two weeks after exposure, 77% of the administered dose was eliminated in urine (55%) and faeces (22%). TLC of urine collected over the first 15 hr after exposure showed at least 8 bands of metabolites, five of which accounted for about two thirds of the dose excreted in urine.","['Animals', 'Carbon Dioxide', 'Chromatography, Thin Layer', 'Feces', 'Female', 'Goats', 'Half-Life', 'Injections, Intravenous', 'Male', 'Organothiophosphorus Compounds', 'Tissue Distribution']",1946189,"[['B01.050'], ['D01.200.200', 'D01.362.150', 'D01.650.550.200'], ['E05.196.181.400.537'], ['A12.459'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.500.380.513'], ['G01.910.405'], ['E02.319.267.082.750', 'E02.319.267.530.540'], ['D02.705.539', 'D02.886.300'], ['G03.787.917', 'G07.690.725.949']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Fluorescence decrease of conjugated polymers by the catalytic activity of horseradish peroxidase and its application in phenolic compounds detection.,"We report the fluorescence decrease of the water-soluble ð-ð-conjugated polymer poly(2-methoxy-5-propyloxy sulfonate phenylene vinylene, MPS-PPV) by the catalytic activity of horseradish peroxidase in the presence of H(2)O(2). MPS-PPV acts as a donor substrate in the catalytic cycle of horseradish peroxidase where the electron-deficient enzymatic intermediates compounds I and II can subtract electrons from the polymer leading to its fluorescence decrease. The addition of phenolic drug acetaminophen to the former solution favors the decrease of the polymer fluorescence, which indicates the peroxidase-catalyzed co-oxidation of MPS-PPV and acetaminophen. The encapsulation of horseradish peroxidase within polyacrylamide microgels allows the isolation of intermediates compound I and compound II from the polymer, leading to a fluorescence decrease that is only due to the product of biocatalytic acetaminophen oxidation. This system could be used to develop a new device for phenolic compounds detection.","['Acetaminophen', 'Biocatalysis', 'Horseradish Peroxidase', 'Polymers', 'Spectrometry, Fluorescence', 'Spectrophotometry, Ultraviolet']",21341687,"[['D02.065.199.092.040', 'D02.092.146.113.092.040'], ['G02.111.086', 'G02.130.500', 'G03.105'], ['D08.811.682.732.512'], ['D05.750', 'D25.720', 'J01.637.051.720'], ['E05.196.712.516.600.676', 'E05.196.867.726'], ['E05.196.712.726.802', 'E05.196.867.826.802']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
Standardizing for microsatellite length in comparisons of genetic diversity.,"Mutation rates at microsatellites tend to increase with the number of repeats of the motif, leading to higher levels of polymorphism at long microsatellites. To standardize levels of diversity when microsatellites differ in size, we investigate the relationship between tract length and variation and provide a formula to adjust allelic richness to a fixed mean number of repeats in the specific case of chloroplast microsatellites. A comparison between 39 loci from eight species of conifers (where chloroplast DNA is paternally inherited) and 64 loci from 12 species of angiosperms (where chloroplast DNA is generally predominantly maternally inherited) indicates that the greater allelic richness found in conifers remains significant after controlling for number of repeats. The approach stresses the advantage of reporting variation in number of repeats instead of relative fragment sizes.","['DNA, Chloroplast', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genetic Variation', 'Magnoliopsida', 'Microsatellite Repeats', 'Models, Genetic', 'Mutation', 'Regression Analysis', 'Tracheophyta']",15723680,"[['D13.444.308.283.170', 'D13.444.308.435.275'], ['G05.330'], ['G05.365'], ['B01.650.940.800.575.912.250'], ['G02.111.570.080.708.800.500', 'G05.360.080.708.800.500', 'G05.360.340.024.850.500'], ['E05.599.395.397'], ['G05.365.590'], ['E05.318.740.750', 'N05.715.360.750.695', 'N06.850.520.830.750'], ['B01.650.940.800.575.912']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]']",0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
Genetic trends of conformation traits and genetic correlations to osteochondrosis in boars.,"The objective of our study was to investigate the heritabilities and genetic correlations between traits from a linear exterior assessment system and osteochondrosis (OC) measured by computed tomography (CT), and in addition, to study the genetic trend in a population where the conformation traits have been included in the breeding goal. The data material consisted of phenotypes from a total of 4571 Norsvin Landrace test boars. At the end of the test period, all boars were subjected to a detailed exterior assessment system. Within 10 days of the assessment, the boars were CT scanned for measuring OC. The total score of osteochondrosis (OCT), used in this study, is the sum of phenotypes from the assessment on the medial and lateral condyles at the distal end of both the humerus and the femur of the right and the left leg of the boar based on images from CT. The exterior assessment traits included in the study were; 'front leg knee' (FKNE), 'front leg pasterns' (FPAS), 'front leg stance' (FSTA), 'front leg twisted pasterns' (FFLK), 'hind leg stance', 'hind leg pasterns' (HPAS), 'hind leg standing under' (HSTU), 'hind leg small inner toe', 'dipped back', 'arched back' (ARCH) and 'waddling hindquarters' (WADL). The estimation of (co)variance components and breeding values were performed using bivariate animal genetic models. Breeding values for HSTU, HPAS, FPAS, WADL and OCT traits were additional outputs from the same bivariate analyses. The lowest heritability was found for FFLK (h 2 FFLK=0.05), whereas FPAS was estimated to have the highest heritability (h 2 FPAS=0.36), and OCT demonstrating a heritability of 0.29. Significant genetic correlations were found between several traits; the strongest correlation was between FSTA and FFLK (0.94), which was followed by the correlation between FPAS and FKNE (0.69). The traits ARCH and FSTA had significant genetic correlations to OCT, whereas all other genetic correlations between OCT and the conformation traits were low and not significantly different from 0. Our study shows positive genetic trends for the conformation traits included in the breeding goal. In general, low genetic correlations between conformation traits and OC were observed in our study.","['Animals', 'Bone and Bones', 'Breeding', 'Forelimb', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Hindlimb', 'Male', 'Osteochondrosis', 'Swine', 'Swine Diseases', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed']",24816139,"[['B01.050'], ['A02.835.232', 'A10.165.265'], ['E05.820.150', 'G05.090'], ['A13.395'], ['C23.550.291.687.500', 'G05.380.355'], ['A13.473'], ['C05.116.821'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.500.880'], ['C22.905'], ['E01.370.350.350.810', 'E01.370.350.600.350.700.810', 'E01.370.350.700.700.810', 'E01.370.350.700.810.810', 'E01.370.350.825.810.810']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Diseases [C]']",1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Outcomes of 447 SCORE® highly congruent mobile-bearing total knee arthroplasties after 5-10 years follow-up.,"INTRODUCTION: The goal of mobile-bearing total knee arthroplasties (TKA) with an anatomical trochlea is to reduce polyethylene wear, the risk of loosening, and patellofemoral complications. Rotating mobile-bearing SCORE(®) TKA was designed according to these principles with standard instrumentation for component placement and a specific computer navigation system, Amplivision(®).HYPOTHESIS: We hypothesized that the results of SCORE(®) TKA would be satisfactory and better using computer navigation with or without patellar resurfacing and that there would be no specific patellofemoral complications associated with this trochlear design.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Four hundred and forty-seven SCORE(®) TKA were performed. Outcome assessment was based on the IKS score, and component survival calculated by Kaplan-Meier analysis.RESULTS: Mean follow-up was 6.6 years (maximum 10.6 years). Six percent of patients were lost to follow-up. Ninety-eight percent of the patients were satisfied or very satisfied. The IKS knee score was 89 points and the function score was 86. The mechanical axis was 180° (174-186), and it was significantly improved if the initial deformity was severe and TKA was computer navigated. There were nine revisions (one for fracture, two for pain, two for stiffness, four for infection).DISCUSSION: This study confirmed our hypothesis: the results of SCORE(®) TKA were very satisfying after at least 5 years of follow-up because there was no mechanical loosening, no bearing dislocation and no patellofemoral complications with or without patellar resurfacing. Results were identical whether patellar resurfacing was performed or not. Although clinical results were not better for computer- navigated TKA, radiological results were. At 98 months of follow-up, component survival in relation to the risk of aseptic loosening or patellofemoral complications was 100%.LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level IV continuous retrospective study.","['Aged', 'Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'France', 'Humans', 'Knee Prosthesis', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pain Measurement', 'Patient Satisfaction', 'Prosthesis Design', 'Prosthesis Failure', 'Range of Motion, Articular', 'Recovery of Function', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Assessment', 'Surgery, Computer-Assisted', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']",23988419,"[['M01.060.116.100'], ['E04.555.110.110.115', 'E04.650.110.115', 'E04.680.101.110.115'], ['E05.318.372.500.750', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.249', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.350', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.350'], ['Z01.542.286'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E07.695.400.410'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['E01.370.600.550.324'], ['F01.100.150.750.625', 'F01.145.488.887.625', 'N04.452.822.700', 'N05.300.150.800.625', 'N05.715.360.600'], ['E05.320.550', 'E07.695.680'], ['C23.550.767.865', 'E05.325.771'], ['E01.370.600.700', 'G11.427.760'], ['G16.757'], ['E05.318.372.500.500.500', 'E05.318.372.500.750.750', 'N05.715.360.330.500.500.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.825', 'N06.850.520.450.500.500.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.825'], ['E05.318.740.600.800.715', 'N04.452.871.715', 'N05.715.360.750.625.700.690', 'N06.850.505.715', 'N06.850.520.830.600.800.715'], ['E04.749'], ['G01.910.857'], ['E01.789.800', 'N04.761.559.590.800', 'N05.715.360.575.575.800']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",0,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1

Changes in cardiac diastolic dimensions precede hypertrophy in early stages of hypertension.,"BACKGROUND: Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) has been identified as a main target organ change resulting from hypertension, also being a long-term predictor of myocardial infarction, stroke and cardiovascular death. However, very few longitudinal studies exist following the development of LVH in the hypertensive process.METHODS: The present longitudinal study investigated a population based group of borderline hypertensive men (BHT, n = 66, diastolic blood pressure (BP) 85-94 mm Hg). M-mode echocardiography was performed at baseline and after 3 years, and anthropometrical data recorded.RESULTS: There was no increase in LVH indices over the 3-year period, while there was a statistically significant increase in aortic root dimension (P < 0.001), left atrial diameter in diastole (LADD, P < 0.001), left ventricular diameter in diastole (LVDD, P < 0.001) and peak systolic wall stress (PSWS, P < 0.01) and a significant decrease in left ventricular ejection time (LVET, P < 0.01). Baseline BP levels correlated to PSWS (P < 0.05) but not to LVH indices, whereas body mass index (BMI) correlated significantly to wall thickness (P < 0.05) and LV mass (P < 0.05).CONCLUSIONS: LVH indices did not increase over a 3-year period. However, there was a significant increase in aortic root dimension, LADD, LVDD and PSWS, and a significantly shortened LVET, suggesting that these changes precede any increase in LVH. Finally, BMI showed stronger correlation to LVH indices than did BP levels.","['Adult', 'Blood Pressure', 'Body Mass Index', 'Diastole', 'Echocardiography', 'Humans', 'Hypertension', 'Hypertrophy, Left Ventricular', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Smoking']",9819015,"[['M01.060.116'], ['E01.370.600.875.249', 'G09.330.380.076'], ['E01.370.600.115.100.125', 'E05.041.124.125', 'G07.100.100.125', 'N06.850.505.200.100.175'], ['G09.330.580.295', 'G11.427.494.554.250', 'G11.427.494.570.295'], ['E01.370.350.130.750', 'E01.370.350.850.220', 'E01.370.370.380.220'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C14.907.489'], ['C14.280.195.400', 'C23.300.775.250.400'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.500'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['F01.145.805']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]']",0,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system in nephrotic syndrome.,"Previous studies on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and fluid volumes in patients with nephrotic syndrome have not considered the nature of the underlying renal lesion. We compared plasma renin concentration (PRC), plasma aldosterone (PA), and plasma volume in three groups of patients: five nephrotic patients with minimal change disease on renal biopsy, seven nephrotic patients with other renal histopathology, and a control group of eight patients investigated for glomerulonephritis with no past or present nephrosis. PRC and PA were significantly greater in nephrotic patients with minimal change disease than other renal histopathology (Supine PRC 42 +/- 7 microIU/mL compared with 14 +/- 4, P less than 0.01; ambulant PRC 56 +/- 7 microIU/mL compared with 29 +/- 10, P less than 0.05; supine PA 158 +/- 55 pg/mL compared with 53 +/- 13, P less than 0.05; and ambulant PA 167 +/- 57 pg/mL compared with 29 +/- 10, P less than 0.05.

[Early human papillomavirus testing predicts residual/recurrent disease after LEEP risk factors for predicting residual disease in high-grade squamous cervical intraepithelial neoplasia following LEEP conization].,"OBJECTIVE: To explore the risk factors for residual/recurrent disease of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 2 or worse after loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP) and the timing point for postoperative follow-up.METHODS: 428 patients with CIN 2 or CIN 3 who were treated with LEEP were retrospectively reviewed. Postoperative follow-up was performed by Pap smear and human papillomavirus (HPV) hybrid capture 2 (HC2) testing. The definition of persistent/recurrent disease was biopsy-proven CIN 2 or worse.RESULTS: 296 patients were CIN 2 and 132 were CIN 3 among 428 patients. The positive rate of HPV HC2 before LEEP was 86.7% (371/428). During follow-up, 26 patients (6.1%) had residual/recurrent disease, the positive LEEP margin, especially the cone top status, was a significant risk factor for persistent/recurrent disease. Other factors such as age, HPV viral load [> or =100 relative light units (RLU)], and HPV typing (type 16/18 vs. other types) did not predict recurrence. HPV HC2 test at 3 months after LEEP can find all the residual/recurrent disease, the sensitivity and negative predictive value of the HPV HC2 test for residual/recurrent disease were both 100% at 3 and 6 months.CONCLUSION: The positive margin of LEEP specimen especially the cone top status was a significant risk factor for residual/recurrent disease after LEEP. HPV test at 3 months during follow-up can offer timely information about residual/recurrent disease and help for the risk control in treatment selection.","['Biopsy', 'Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia', 'Conization', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Papanicolaou Test', 'Papillomaviridae', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Uterine Cervical Neoplasms', 'Vaginal Smears', 'Viral Load']",25924452,"[['E01.370.225.500.384.100', 'E01.370.225.998.054', 'E01.370.388.100', 'E04.074', 'E05.200.500.384.100', 'E05.200.998.054', 'E05.242.384.100'], ['C04.557.470.200.240.250'], ['E01.370.225.500.384.100.160', 'E01.370.225.998.054.160', 'E01.370.388.100.160', 'E04.074.160', 'E05.200.500.384.100.160', 'E05.200.998.054.160', 'E05.242.384.100.160'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C04.697.655', 'C23.550.727.655'], ['C04.697.700', 'C23.550.727.700'], ['E01.370.225.500.384.100.422', 'E01.370.225.998.054.422', 'E04.074.422', 'E05.200.500.384.100.422', 'E05.200.998.054.422', 'E05.242.384.100.422'], ['B04.280.210.655', 'B04.613.204.655'], ['E05.318.372.500.500.500', 'E05.318.372.500.750.750', 'N05.715.360.330.500.500.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.825', 'N06.850.520.450.500.500.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.825'], ['E05.318.740.600.800.725', 'N05.715.350.200.700', 'N05.715.360.750.625.700.700', 'N06.850.490.625.750', 'N06.850.520.830.600.800.725'], ['C04.588.945.418.948.850', 'C13.351.500.852.593.131', 'C13.351.500.852.762.850', 'C13.351.937.418.875.850'], ['E01.370.225.500.384.100.800', 'E01.370.225.998.054.800', 'E01.370.378.900', 'E04.074.800', 'E05.200.500.384.100.800', 'E05.200.998.054.800', 'E05.242.384.100.800'], ['E01.370.225.875.950', 'E05.200.875.950', 'G06.920.850']]","['Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
Organic UV filters exposure induces the production of inflammatory cytokines in human macrophages.,"Organic ultraviolet (UV) filters, found in many personal care products, are considered emerging contaminants due to growing concerns about potential long-term deleterious effects. We investigated the immunomodulatory effects of four commonly used organic UV filters (2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzophenone, BP-3; 4-methylbenzylidene camphor, 4-MBC; 2-ethylhexyl 4-methoxycinnamate, EHMC; and butyl-methoxydibenzoylmethane, BDM) on human macrophages. Our results indicated that exposure to these four UV filters significantly increased the production of various inflammatory cytokines in macrophages, particular tumor necrosis factor-á (TNF-á) and interleukin-6 (IL-6). After exposure to the UV filters, a significant 1.1-1.5 fold increase were found in TNF-á and IL-6 mRNA expression. In addition, both the p38 MAPK and the NF-êB signaling pathways were enhanced 2 to 10 times in terms of phosphorylation after exposure to the UV filters, suggesting that these pathways are involved in the release of TNF-á and IL-6. Molecular docking analysis predicted that all four UV filter molecules would efficiently bind transforming growth factor beta-activated kinase 1 (TAK1), which is responsible for the activation of the p38 MAPK and NF-êB pathways. Our results therefore demonstrate that exposure to the four organic UV filters investigated may alter human immune system function. It provides new clue for the development of asthma or allergic diseases in terms of the environmental pollutants.","['Benzophenones', 'Camphor', 'Cell Line', 'Cinnamates', 'Cytokines', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6', 'Macrophages', 'Molecular Docking Simulation', 'Propiophenones', 'Sunscreening Agents', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha', 'Water Pollutants, Chemical']",29710614,"[['D02.455.426.559.389.134', 'D02.522.223'], ['D02.455.426.100.080.050.500.326', 'D02.455.426.100.080.550.234.326', 'D02.455.849.575.141.500.326', 'D02.522.376', 'D04.075.080.500.234.326'], ['A11.251.210'], ['D02.241.223.200'], ['D12.644.276.374', 'D12.776.467.374', 'D23.529.374'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D12.644.276.374.465.224', 'D12.776.467.374.465.202', 'D23.529.374.465.224'], ['A11.329.372', 'A11.627.482', 'A11.733.397', 'A15.382.670.522', 'A15.382.680.397'], ['E05.599.595.249', 'L01.224.160.249'], ['D02.522.818'], ['D27.505.696.706.776.800', 'D27.505.954.444.695', 'D27.720.269.800', 'D27.720.799.763.764'], ['D12.644.276.374.500.800', 'D12.644.276.374.750.626', 'D12.776.124.900', 'D12.776.395.930', 'D12.776.467.374.500.800', 'D12.776.467.374.750.626', 'D23.529.374.500.800', 'D23.529.374.750.626'], ['D27.888.284.903.655']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Information Science [L]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
A coarse-grain MD (molecular dynamic) simulation of PCL-PEG and PLA-PEG aggregation as a computational model for prediction of the drug-loading efficacy of doxorubicin.,"Formulating a hydrophobic drug that is water-soluble is a pharmaceutical challenge. One way is to incorporate the drug in an amphiphilic micelle composed from an aggregation of block copolymers. Design of a good nano-micelle requires many trial-and-error attempts. In this article, we developed a computational model based on a coarse-grained molecular dynamic (MD) simulation and correlated outputs with previous studies. A good correlation shows that this model reliably simulates poly-lactic acid-poly-ethylene glycol (PLA-PEG) and poly-caprolactone (PCL)-PEG aggregation in water with and without the presence of doxorubicin.

Technical and policy approaches to balancing patient privacy and data sharing in clinical and translational research.,"INTRODUCTION: Clinical researchers need to share data to support scientific validation and information reuse and to comply with a host of regulations and directives from funders. Various organizations are constructing informatics resources in the form of centralized databases to ensure reuse of data derived from sponsored research. The widespread use of such open databases is contingent on the protection of patient privacy.METHODS: We review privacy-related problems associated with data sharing for clinical research from technical and policy perspectives. We investigate existing policies for secondary data sharing and privacy requirements in the context of data derived from research and clinical settings. In particular, we focus on policies specified by the US National Institutes of Health and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act and touch on how these policies are related to current and future use of data stored in public database archives. We address aspects of data privacy and identifiability from a technical, although approachable, perspective and summarize how biomedical databanks can be exploited and seemingly anonymous records can be reidentified using various resources without hacking into secure computer systems.RESULTS: We highlight which clinical and translational data features, specified in emerging research models, are potentially vulnerable or exploitable. In the process, we recount a recent privacy-related concern associated with the publication of aggregate statistics from pooled genome-wide association studies that have had a significant impact on the data sharing policies of National Institutes of Health-sponsored databanks.CONCLUSION: Based on our analysis and observations we provide a list of recommendations that cover various technical, legal, and policy mechanisms that open clinical databases can adopt to strengthen data privacy protection as they move toward wider deployment and adoption.","['Base Sequence', 'Computer Security', 'Genome-Wide Association Study', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Information Dissemination', 'National Institutes of Health (U.S.)', 'Phenotype', 'Privacy', 'Translational Medical Research', 'United States']",20051768,"[['G02.111.570.080', 'G05.360.080', 'L01.453.245.667.080'], ['L01.224.134', 'N04.452.910.200'], ['E05.318.370.392', 'E05.318.416.249', 'E05.393.385.500', 'E05.393.522.500', 'E05.393.760.640.500', 'N06.850.520.445.392', 'N06.850.520.470.500'], ['G05.380'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['L01.143.443'], ['I01.409.418.750.600.650.496', 'N03.540.052.750', 'N03.540.348.500.500.600.650.496'], ['G05.695'], ['I01.880.604.473.352.500', 'N03.706.437.352.500', 'N03.706.615.862'], ['H01.770.644.145.675'], ['Z01.107.567.875']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]', 'Geographicals [Z]']",0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1
Effect of noxious tail pinch on the discharge rate of mesocortical and mesolimbic dopamine neurons: selective activation of the mesocortical system.,"The effects of noxious tail pinch on the activity of mesocortical and mesolimbic dopamine (DA) neurons located in the ventromedial mesencephalic tegmentum were analyzed in ketamine-anesthetized rats. The great majority of mesocortical DA neurons responded to tail pinch, either by an excitation (65%), or by an inhibition (25%). In contrast, most DA neurons projecting either to the nucleus accumbens or the septum remained unaffected. These results demonstrate that noxious tail pinch selectively influences the firing rate of mesocortical DA neurons.","['Action Potentials', 'Animals', 'Dopamine', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Frontal Lobe', 'Limbic System', 'Male', 'Neural Conduction', 'Neural Pathways', 'Pain', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred Strains', 'Tegmentum Mesencephali']",2702475,"[['G04.580.100', 'G07.265.675.100', 'G11.561.570.100'], ['B01.050'], ['D02.092.211.215.406', 'D02.092.311.342', 'D02.455.426.559.389.657.166.175.342'], ['E05.723.402'], ['A08.186.211.200.885.287.500.270'], ['A08.186.211.180'], ['G07.265.753', 'G11.561.601'], ['A08.612'], ['C23.888.592.612', 'F02.830.816.444', 'G11.561.790.444'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700'], ['B01.050.050.199.520.760', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700.400'], ['A08.186.211.132.659.413.875']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]']",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
High-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry procedure with automated solid phase extraction sample preparation for the quantitative determination of paclitaxel (Taxol) in human plasma.,"A sensitive, specific, accurate and reproducible analytical method was developed and validated for the quantitation of the anticancer agent paclitaxel in human plasma. This procedure is based on high performance liquid chromatography/ion spray-tandem mass spectrometry. This methodology is highly specific because a MS/MS technique (multiple reactant-ion monitoring, MRM) was used for both paclitaxel and its internal standard. The use of a fully automated solid phase extraction procedure, using a CN Sep-pak cartridge, to improve the detection limit and quantification limit of paclitaxel in human plasma samples, was evaluated. The method involves the addition of methyl-paclitaxel as internal standard (i.s.). The retention times of paclitaxel and the I.S. were 2.8 and 4.0 min., respectively. The assay was linear over the range 5 to 500 ng/mL, with a quantification limit of 5 ng/mL having a coefficient of variation (c.v.) < 10%. Standard calibration curves, performed on three different days, had correlation coefficients always greater than 0.998. The intra and inter-day precision were within 12%, and accuracy was included in the range 102-110%. Paclitaxel recovery assessed at 15,250 and 500 ng/mL, was determined to be greater than 85%. The assay is applicable to clinical pharmacokinetic studies.","['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Humans', 'Indicators and Reagents', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Paclitaxel', 'Quality Control']",9519477,"[['D27.505.954.248.179'], ['E05.196.181.400.300'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D27.720.470.410'], ['E05.196.566'], ['D02.455.426.392.368.242.888.777', 'D02.455.849.291.850.777'], ['J01.897.608']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]']",0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
Psychoacoustic and experiential determinants of tonal consonance.,"Theories of tonal consonance have primarily sought to explain consonance of chords smaller than the octave drawn from the conventional semitone musical scale. Critical evaluation of such theories requires a new body of data. The present study reports consonance ratings for two-tone chords drawn from a quartertone scale and for chords larger than an octave as well as for the chords normally studied. Subjects were drawn from undergraduate psychology courses without preselection for musical aptitude or background. The results were compared with predictions derived from several current theories: psychoacoustic models, in which consonance is attributed to a lack of dissonance or harshsounding pairs of components, and a psychological complexity model which relates consonance to the perceived simplicity of the stimulus. The latter theory, which makes allowance for the unfamiliarity of quartertone chords and for the equivalence of extra-octave and within-octave chords, provided the best qualitative account of the data. It was concluded that a valid theory of tonal consonance must acknowledge the effects of musical experience on musical judgment.","['Humans', 'Models, Psychological', 'Music', 'Pitch Perception', 'Psychoacoustics']",7319993,"[['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E05.599.695'], ['K01.602'], ['F02.463.593.071.700', 'G07.888.125.700'], ['E01.370.382.375.060.530', 'E01.370.685.628', 'F04.096.753.628']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Humanities [K]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Experimental new automatic tools for robotic stereotactic neurosurgery: towards ""no hands"" procedure of leads implantation into a brain target.","The use of robotics in neurosurgery and, particularly, in stereotactic neurosurgery, is becoming more and more adopted because of the great advantages that it offers. Robotic manipulators easily allow to achieve great precision, reliability, and rapidity in the positioning of surgical instruments or devices in the brain. The aim of this work was to experimentally verify a fully automatic ""no hands"" surgical procedure. The integration of neuroimaging to data for planning the surgery, followed by application of new specific surgical tools, permitted the realization of a fully automated robotic implantation of leads in brain targets. An anthropomorphic commercial manipulator was utilized. In a preliminary phase, a software to plan surgery was developed, and the surgical tools were tested first during a simulation and then on a skull mock-up. In such a way, several tools were developed and tested, and the basis for an innovative surgical procedure arose. The final experimentation was carried out on anesthetized ""large white"" pigs. The determination of stereotactic parameters for the correct planning to reach the intended target was performed with the same technique currently employed in human stereotactic neurosurgery, and the robotic system revealed to be reliable and precise in reaching the target. The results of this work strengthen the possibility that a neurosurgeon may be substituted by a machine, and may represent the beginning of a new approach in the current clinical practice. Moreover, this possibility may have a great impact not only on stereotactic functional procedures but also on the entire domain of neurosurgery.","['Animals', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Humans', 'Neurosurgery', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Robotics', 'Stereotaxic Techniques', 'Swine', 'Therapy, Computer-Assisted']",27194228,"[['B01.050'], ['A08.186.211'], ['C10.228.140'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['H02.403.810.425'], ['E05.318.370.725', 'E05.337.851', 'N05.715.360.325.685', 'N06.850.520.445.725'], ['H01.671.293.643', 'J01.897.104.834', 'L01.224.050.375.630'], ['E04.525.800', 'E05.873'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.500.880'], ['E02.950', 'L01.313.500.750.100.710']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]', 'Information Science [L]']",1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0

These patients recruited and divided into two groups: nondiabetic foot ulcer group (NDF, n = 865, 85.5%) and diabetic foot ulcer group (DFU, n = 147, 14.5%).After a 1-year-follow-up, DFUs were grouped into healing (n = 110, 74.8%) and nonhealing (n = 37, 25.2%) group based on the clinical prognosis. Compared with the healing group, the nonhealing group were older, had long diabetic duration and had significantly increased serum cystatin C concentrations in DFU (p < 0.01). After adjustments for age, diabetes duration, renal function and infection control, multiple logistical regression analysis revealed that cystatin C remained associated increased risk of undesirable DFU outcome (OR = 7.279, 95% CI: 1.299-40.784, p < 0.05). When divided into quartiles according to cystatin C levels, the healing rate of Quartile 4 was significantly lower (57.9%) compared with other groups (p < 0.01). The odd is ratio (OR) analysis showed that the risk of undesirable DFU outcome in Quartile 4 was significantly higher (OR = 4.554, 95% CI: 3.14-5.12, p < 0.05) compared with that in Quartile 1. We concluded that there was a strong and independent association between serum cystatin C and diabetic foot ulceration prognosis, cystatin C > 1.35 mg/L predicts more than sixfold increased risk of incurable foot ulceration.","['Aged', 'Asian Continental Ancestry Group', 'Biomarkers', 'China', 'Cystatin C', 'Diabetic Foot', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Physical Examination', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Wound Healing']",26864251,"[['M01.060.116.100'], ['M01.686.508.200'], ['D23.101'], ['Z01.252.474.164'], ['D12.776.215.300'], ['C14.907.320.191', 'C17.800.893.592.450.200', 'C19.246.099.500.191', 'C19.246.099.937.250'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.249', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.350', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.350'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['E01.370.600'], ['E05.318.370.800.650', 'N05.715.360.325.700.640', 'N06.850.520.445.800.650'], ['E01.789'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.625', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.650', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.650'], ['E05.318.740.600.800.725', 'N05.715.350.200.700', 'N05.715.360.750.625.700.700', 'N06.850.490.625.750', 'N06.850.520.830.600.800.725'], ['G16.762.891']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1
Subjective reports of cognition in relation to assessed cognitive performance following coronary artery bypass surgery.,"Evidence has accumulated to indicate that a proportion of patients who undergo coronary artery bypass surgery (CABS) do develop significant cognitive deficits. This study examines whether those patients who report cognitive deterioration after CABS do show cognitive changes as assessed by neuropsychological testing. The patients who considered that aspects of their cognitive function had deteriorated, were not found to have reduced functions as assessed on appropriate neuropsychological tests. When mood state was examined, it was found that those who report a deterioration in a particular cognitive function, tended to have significantly higher levels of depression as assessed by the Beck Depression Inventory and, to a lesser extent, have higher levels of state anxiety. These findings emphasise that subjective reports of cognitive function following CABS do not reflect actual changes in cognition but rather appear to be sensitive to mood state.","['Adult', 'Affective Symptoms', 'Aged', 'Attention', 'Cognition', 'Coronary Artery Bypass', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Memory', 'Middle Aged', 'Neuropsychological Tests']",2786075,"[['M01.060.116'], ['F01.145.126.100'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['F02.830.104.214'], ['F02.463.188'], ['E04.100.376.719.332', 'E04.100.814.868.750', 'E04.928.220.520.220'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['F02.463.425.540'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['F04.711.513']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]']",0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
"Osteogenic potential of stem cells-seeded bioactive nanocomposite scaffolds: A comparative study between human mesenchymal stem cells derived from bone, umbilical cord Wharton's jelly, and adipose tissue.","Bone regeneration is considered as an unmet clinical need, the aim of this study is to investigate the osteogenic potential of three different mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) derived from human bone marrow (BM-MSCs), umbilical cord Wharton's jelly (UC-MSCs), and adipose (AD-MSCs) seeded on a recently developed nanocomposite scaffold (bioactive glass/gelatin) implanted in rat animal models with critical size calvarial defects. In this study, after isolation, culture, and characterization, the MSCs were expanded and seeded on the scaffolds for in vitro and in vivo studies. The adhesion, proliferation, and viability of the cells on the scaffolds evaluated in vitro, showed that the scaffolds were biocompatible for further examinations. In order to evaluate the scaffolds in vivo, rat animal models with critical size calvarial defects were randomly categorized in four groups and treated with the scaffolds. The animals were sacrificed at the time points of 4 and 12 weeks of post-implantation, bone healing process were investigated. The histological and immunohistological observations showed (p < 0.01) higher osteogenesis capacity in the group treated with BM-MSCs/scaffolds compared to the other groups. However, the formation of new angiogenesis was evidently higher in the defects filled with UC-MSCs/scaffolds.

Gadopentetate dimeglumine as an oral negative gastrointestinal contrast agent for MRCP.,"BACKGROUND: We investigated the feasibility of using intravenous magnetic resonance (MR) contrast agent as a gastrointestinal oral negative contrast agent to null the bowel signal during MR cholangiopancreatography (MRCP).METHODS: In the first part of the study, a phantom study was performed to select the optimal concentration of MR contrast agent to be used as an oral negative contrast agent in MRCP. In the second part of the study, 23 consecutive patients suffering from different pancreaticobiliary diseases were imaged with a single-shot fast spin-echo pulse sequence. The data acquisition was started without oral contrast agent and then repeated with oral contrast agent. From the MR images taken with and without oral contrast agent, the gallbladder, cystic duct, common bile duct, and pancreatic duct were assessed and graded by two radiologists.RESULTS: The oral contrast agent was tolerated well by all patients. In all patients the high signal intensity from the intestinal fluid was completely suppressed. The depictions of the gallbladder and cystic duct were slightly and moderately improved, respectively, whereas the depictions of the common bile duct and pancreatic duct were markedly improved by the oral contrast agent administration.CONCLUSION: Diluted intravenous MR contrast agent can be an effective and safe oral negative contrast agent in eliminating signal intensity of the gastrointestinal tract, thus improving the depiction of the biliary system in MRCP.","['Biliary Tract Diseases', 'Common Bile Duct', 'Contrast Media', 'Cystic Duct', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Female', 'Gadolinium DTPA', 'Gallbladder', 'Humans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pancreatic Diseases', 'Pancreatic Ducts', 'Phantoms, Imaging']",10926195,"[['C06.130'], ['A03.159.183.079.300'], ['D27.505.259.500', 'D27.720.259'], ['A03.159.183.079.450'], ['E05.318.372.550', 'E05.337.675', 'N05.715.360.330.550', 'N06.850.520.450.550'], ['D02.092.782.590.401', 'D02.241.081.018.639.400', 'D02.257.141'], ['A03.159.439'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E01.370.350.825.500'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['C06.689'], ['A03.734.667'], ['E07.671']]","['Diseases [C]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Named Groups [M]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
Persistent diffuse peritonitis in children.,"In adults, persistent diffuse peritonitis (PDP) having a special microbiologic spectrum is now defined as a distinct intraabdominal infection because of its aggressive clinical course. Considering also other types of peritonitis, this study was performed to determine characteristics of childhood PDP in regard to clinical picture, microbiologic features, treatment and outcome. Classification of 175 patients with peritonitis showed that nine patients had primary peritonitis and 121, 37 and eight patients had secondary peritonitis, PDP, and intraabdominal abscess, respectively. Rates of host defense affecting disease, extra-appendicular origin, and mortality were markedly higher in the PDP group. However, polymicrobic and anaerobic infection rates were lower in the PDP group than those of the secondary peritonitis group. While 26 of 37 patients with PDP underwent surgical intervention, the remaining 11 patients were managed by conservative measures. In the PDP group, mortality was 18 percent for conservatively and 23 percent for surgically treated patients. Being of young age, presence of an accompanying disease and fungal growth increased the mortality. The results indicate that PDP is a distinct type of peritonitis in children as well as in adults. In addition, accurate identification of these patients may prevent some unnecessary operations and improve survival by the choice of more conservative treatment plans.","['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Distribution', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chronic Disease', 'Debridement', 'Drainage', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Intubation, Gastrointestinal', 'Male', 'Peritonitis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Sex Distribution']",9677719,"[['M01.060.057'], ['M01.060.116'], ['I01.240.050', 'N01.224.033', 'N06.850.505.400.050'], ['D27.505.954.122.085'], ['M01.060.406'], ['M01.060.406.448'], ['C23.550.291.500'], ['E04.176'], ['E02.309', 'E04.237'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.703'], ['M01.060.703.520'], ['E02.585.412', 'E05.497.412'], ['C01.463.600', 'C06.844.640'], ['E05.318.372.500.500.500', 'E05.318.372.500.750.750', 'N05.715.360.330.500.500.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.825', 'N06.850.520.450.500.500.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.825'], ['E05.318.308.980.438.475.456.500', 'N05.715.360.300.800.438.375.364.500', 'N06.850.520.308.980.438.475.364.500'], ['I01.240.800', 'N01.224.803', 'N06.850.505.400.850']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0
"[Implementation of the German guideline for the prevention, diagnosis, treatment and follow-up of non-small cell lung cancer at the Diakoniekrankenhaus Halle/Saale].","BACKGROUND: More than three years since the release of the german guideline for the prevention, diagnosis, treatment and follow-up of lung cancer the database in terms of the implementation of guideline recommendations is deficient. The aim of this article is to analyze the implementation of the recommended algorithms for first-line therapy of non-small cell lung cancer.PATIENTS AND METHODS: On the basis of the patients records we determined all cases of newly diagnosed non-small cell lung cancer which received a first-line therapy at the Diakoniekrankenhaus Halle/Saale between January 2010 and December 2011. The demographic data, tumor stage, time of diagnosis and performed first-line therapy were documented. Each case was assigned to the groups ""guideline-adherent treatment"" or ""deviation from guideline recommendation"" in dependency of its tumor stage. For this assignment the corresponding algorithms from guideline chapter ""Therapy of non-small lung cancer"" were used.RESULTS: A total of 126 from 148 cases (85%) received guideline-adherent treatment. Deviation from guideline recommendation was found in 22 cases (15%). The categories ""poor performance status"", ""technical factors"", ""patient decision"" and ""others"" were determined as the main reasons for non guideline-adherent treatment.CONCLUSIONS: Based on the analyzed population this study determined a high grade of guideline adherence at the period of investigation. Otherwise it shows that guideline recommendations cannot include each individual factor of the complex lung cancer disease. It could be found a wide range of reasons for deviation from the guideline recommendations.","['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Germany', 'Guideline Adherence', 'Humans', 'Lung Neoplasms', 'Male', 'Medical Oncology', 'Practice Guidelines as Topic', 'Pulmonary Medicine']",24222066,"[['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['M01.060.116.100.080'], ['C04.588.894.797.520.109.220.249', 'C08.381.540.140.500', 'C08.785.520.100.220.500'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.249', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.350', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.350'], ['Z01.542.315'], ['N04.761.337', 'N05.715.360.395'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C04.588.894.797.520', 'C08.381.540', 'C08.785.520'], ['H02.403.429.515'], ['N04.761.700.350.650', 'N05.700.350.650'], ['H02.403.429.675']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]']",0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1
Development of a weak-base docetaxel derivative that can be loaded into lipid nanoparticles.,"Hydrophobic uncharged drugs such as docetaxel are difficult to encapsulate and retain in liposomal nanoparticles (LNP). In this work we show that a weak base derivative of docetaxel can be actively loaded into LNP using pH gradient loading techniques to achieve stable drug encapsulation and controlled release properties. Docetaxel was derivatized at the hydroxyl group in the C-2' position to form an N-methyl-piperazinyl butanoic acid ester. The free hydroxyl group in this position is essential for anticancer activity and the prodrug has, therefore, to be converted into the parent drug (docetaxel) to restore activity. Cytotoxicity testing against a panel of cancer cell lines (breast, prostate and ovarian cancer) demonstrated that the prodrug is readily converted into active drug; the derivative was found to be as active as the parent drug in vitro. The docetaxel derivative can be efficiently loaded at high drug-to-lipid ratios (up to 0.4 mg/mg) into LNP using pH loading techniques. Pharmacokinetic, tolerability and efficacy studies in mice demonstrate that the LNP-encapsulated prodrug has the long drug circulation half-life required for efficient tumor accumulation (50-100 times higher drug plasma levels compared with free derivative and Taxotere, the commercial docetaxel formulation), is active in a xenograft model of breast cancer (MDA-MB-435/LCC6), and is well tolerated at i.v. doses of 3 times higher than the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of the parent drug. This is the first demonstration that a therapeutically active, remote-loaded, controlled-release LNP formulation of a taxane can be achieved. The approach reported here has broad applicability to other approved drugs as well as new chemical entities.","['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Breast Neoplasms', 'Cryoelectron Microscopy', 'Docetaxel', 'Drug Carriers', 'Drug Compounding', 'Drug Stability', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Lipids', 'Mice', 'Molecular Structure', 'Nanoparticles', 'Solubility', 'Taxoids', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",20202473,"[['B01.050'], ['D27.505.954.248'], ['C04.588.180', 'C17.800.090.500'], ['E01.370.350.515.402.150', 'E05.595.402.150'], ['D02.455.426.392.368.242.888.389', 'D02.455.849.291.850.389'], ['D26.255.260', 'E02.319.300.380'], ['E05.916.270'], ['E05.916.330'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['G02.300'], ['D10'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500'], ['G02.111.570', 'G02.466'], ['J01.637.512.600'], ['G02.805'], ['D02.455.426.392.368.242.888', 'D02.455.849.291.850'], ['E05.337.550.200.900', 'E05.624.850']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
Water-bath method for sonographic evaluation of superficial structures of the extremities in children.,"High-resolution sonography using a stand-off pad or a gel mound is a standard technique for the evaluation of soft-tissue structures of the hands and feet in children. However, the complex curved surfaces of the hands and feet often yield suboptimal contact between the transducer and the skin. Additionally, the small field of view, relative compressibility of the soft-tissue structures by the transducer, patient motion and discomfort from contact of the transducer with the pathology often limit conventional US evaluation. A water-bath technique overcomes these limitations. We present our experience of water-bath technique of superficial sonography in 23 children. Water-bath technique was performed with good patient cooperation and was superior to the standard technique for depiction of shallow skin ulcers, subcutaneous masses, vascular malformations, osteomyelitis and foreign bodies.","['Baths', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Connective Tissue Diseases', 'Extremities', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Image Enhancement', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Ultrasonography']",23478918,"[['E02.056.110'], ['M01.060.406'], ['M01.060.406.448'], ['C17.300'], ['A01.378'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E01.370.350.600.350', 'L01.224.308.380'], ['M01.060.703'], ['M01.060.703.520'], ['E01.370.350.850']]","['Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Information Science [L]']",1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0
Overexpression of the dopamine receptor-interacting protein Alix/AIP1 modulates NMDA receptor-triggered cell death.,"Alix/AIP1 is an adaptor protein involved in apoptosis, endocytic membrane trafficking and brain development. Alix has been found within the human postsynaptic density (PSD) and, since NMDA receptors (NMDARs) are central components of the PSD, we hypothesized that the close proximity of both proteins may allow Alix to influence the downstream pathways following NMDAR activation. NMDARs play important roles in excitotoxicity and we evaluated the effects of recombinant Alix in an NMDAR cell death assay. Overexpression of Alix with NMDARs increases the potency of NMDAR- induced cell death compared to cells expressing only NMDARs, and this requires expression of the Alix C-terminal region. Therefore, we demonstrate a previously unreported role for Alix as a potential modulator of NMDAR function.","['Animals', 'Calcium-Binding Proteins', 'Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Cell Death', 'Endosomal Sorting Complexes Required for Transport', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Rats', 'Receptors, N-Methyl-D-Aspartate']",31077357,"[['B01.050'], ['D12.776.157.125'], ['D12.776.167'], ['G04.146'], ['D05.500.199', 'D12.776.543.990.493'], ['A11.251.210.172.750', 'A11.436.334'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700'], ['D12.776.157.530.400.400.500.500', 'D12.776.543.550.450.500.200.500', 'D12.776.543.585.400.500.200.500', 'D12.776.543.750.720.200.450.400.500']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Evaluating the enantioselective degradation and novel metabolites following a single oral dose of metalaxyl in mice.,"Metalaxyl [N-(2,6-dimethylphenyl)-N-(methoxyacetyl)-D,L-alaninemethylester] is a systemic fungicide widely used in agriculture. In this study, the enantioselective distribution, degradation and excretion of metalaxyl were investigated after oral gavage administration of rac-metalaxyl to mice. Concentration of metalaxyl and its enantiomers was determined by HPLC-MS/MS. The results showed that R-metalaxyl was much higher than S-metalaxyl in heart, liver, lung, urine and feces. As for the strong first pass effect, concentrations of metalaxyl in liver were much higher than those in other tissues. The total body clearance (CL) of metalaxyl in mice was 1.77 L h(-1 )kg(-1) and degradation half-lives of (t1/2) of S-metalaxyl and R-metalaxyl in liver were 2.2 h and 3.0 h, respectively. Such results indicated the enantioselectivity of metalaxyl lies in distribution, degradation and excretion processes in mice.

"PBL Core Skills Faculty Development Workshop 3: understanding PBL process assessment and feedback via scenario-based discussions, observation, and role-play.","Tutorial assessment in PBL is thought to be a valid assessment approach and is believed to exert a positive impact on the learning process. Reports, however, have demonstrated that assessment by the facilitator can be unreliable. Training of faculty to conduct this type of assessment has tended to be lacking and is a likely contributor to this inconsistency. This report describes the final in a series of foundation-building faculty development workshops focused on the instructional methodology of PBL. The PBL Assessment and Feedback workshop reported here introduced the theory and practice of conducting process-based assessment accompanied by formative feedback. Scenario-based discussions, mock group demonstration, role-modeling, and role-play were utilized as adult learning-appropriate strategies to familiarize participants with process-based assessment and feedback. Evaluation of the workshop by participants provided evidence that the majority of participants were satisfied with the methods and content of the workshop. Suggestions for additional training in these assessment methods included additional examples, practice, workshops, or observation and mentoring.","['Adult', 'Education', 'Education, Dental', 'Educational Measurement', 'Faculty, Dental', 'Feedback', 'Humans', 'Mentors', 'Problem-Based Learning', 'Staff Development', 'Teaching']",18096882,"[['M01.060.116'], ['I02'], ['I02.358.274'], ['I02.399'], ['M01.526.485.360', 'M01.526.702.250.273', 'N02.360.360'], ['L01.906.394.211'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.395'], ['F02.463.425.720', 'I02.158.660', 'I02.903.565'], ['I02.574.700', 'N04.452.677.822'], ['I02.903']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]']",0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,0
HLA antigens and myasthenia gravis in north India.,"The HLA antigen distribution was studied in 37 north Indian patients with myasthenia gravis. The control group consisted of 118 normal, healthy individuals of the same ethnic group. The antigens showing the highest frequency were Bw21 (18.9% vs 4.2% p less than 0.005), Bw35 (24.3% vs 6.8%, p less than 0.005) and A9 (51.3% vs 30.5%, p less than 0.025). HLA-B8 was increased nearly two fold in the myasthenia gravis patients (RR = 2.4) and was confined mainly to the young females without thymoma. The possibility that Bw21 and Bw35 might be the markers for susceptibility to autoimmune disorders in India is discussed. The observations also support those of others that HLA-B8 linked susceptibility gene is more frequently found in myasthenia gravis patients with thymic hyperplasia.","['Disease Susceptibility', 'Female', 'HLA Antigens', 'Humans', 'India', 'Male', 'Myasthenia Gravis', 'Risk']",6842252,"[['C23.550.291.687', 'G07.100.250'], ['D23.050.301.500.450', 'D23.050.705.552.450'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['Z01.252.245.393'], ['C04.588.614.550.500', 'C04.730.856.490', 'C10.114.656', 'C10.574.781.588', 'C10.668.758.725', 'C20.111.258.500'], ['E05.318.740.600.800', 'G17.680.750', 'N05.715.360.750.625.700', 'N06.850.520.830.600.800']]","['Diseases [C]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1
Development and validation of HILIC-ESI/MS/MS methods for simultaneous quantitation of several antipsychotics in human plasma and blood.,"BACKGROUND: Knowledge of antipsychotic drug levels at point of care (POC) may significantly aid therapeutic decision-making. To support the development of future POC devices and to validate the use of fingerstick capillary blood sampling, two robust hydrophilic interaction LC-ESI/MS/MS methods were developed and validated. Two PK studies were completed evaluating the correlation between fingerstick blood and plasma concentrations with corresponding venous blood and plasma concentrations for several commonly prescribed atypical antipsychotics and selected metabolites. Sensitive and reliable LC-MS/MS bioanalytical assays were developed to support these studies.RESULTS: Three methods, requiring only 25-ìl matrix volumes, were developed using supported liquid extraction with hydrophilic interaction LC-MS/MS detection and validated according to regulatory guidance.CONCLUSION: Robust and efficient LC-MS/MS assays were established and were effective in providing antipsychotic drug matrix comparator results in the intended clinical studies.","['Antipsychotic Agents', 'Blood Chemical Analysis', 'Calibration', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Half-Life', 'Humans', 'Point-of-Care Systems', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization']",27005848,"[['D27.505.696.277.950.040', 'D27.505.954.427.210.950.040', 'D27.505.954.427.700.872.331'], ['E01.370.225.124.100', 'E05.200.124.100'], ['E05.978.155'], ['E05.196.181.400.300'], ['G01.910.405'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['N04.452.442.452.452.680', 'N04.452.515.360.652', 'N04.590.874'], ['E05.318.370.725', 'E05.337.851', 'N05.715.360.325.685', 'N06.850.520.445.725'], ['E05.196.566.600']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Health Care [N]']",0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
Brucella sp. vertebral osteomyelitis with intercurrent fatal Staphylococcus aureus toxigenic enteritis in a bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus).,"A previously beach-stranded, juvenile, male, bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) was diagnosed with vertebral osteomyelitis of unknown etiology. Antemortem serological testing suggested past or current Brucella sp. infection; however, this could not be confirmed prior to death despite multiple isolation attempts from aspirates, blood, and biopsies. Systemic antibiotics were administered for over a year to control the suspected infection; however, the animal succumbed peracutely to infection by a highly pathogenic, enterotoxin-secreting Staphylococcus sp. Gross necropsy findings included a fistulous tract leading to locally extensive osteomyelitis of a coccygeal vertebra with sequestra and osteophytes from which a Brucella species was isolated. Histopathological examination of intestine revealed pseudomembranous enteritis with a uniform population of intraluminal Gram-positive cocci. Staphylococcus aureus was isolated in pure culture from the intestine and tested positive for the staphylococcal enterotoxin A gene by polymerase chain reaction analysis. Serum taken shortly before death had endotoxin and elevated antibody titers to staphylococcal enterotoxin A when compared to samples collected during a period of apparent good health 18 months earlier. The isolation of a pyrogenic toxin superantigen-producing staphylococcal isolate, clinical signs, and diagnostic findings in this animal resembled some of those noted in human toxic shock syndrome. The present case highlights the clinical challenges of treating chronic illnesses, complications of long-term antibiotic use, and promotion of pathogenic strains in cases of prolonged rehabilitation of marine mammals.","['Animals', 'Bottle-Nosed Dolphin', 'Brucella', 'Brucellosis', 'Enteritis', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Male', 'Osteomyelitis', 'Staphylococcal Infections', 'Staphylococcus aureus']",21908337,"[['B01.050'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.875.267.100'], ['B03.440.400.425.215.500', 'B03.660.050.070.100'], ['C01.150.252.400.167'], ['C06.405.205.462', 'C06.405.469.326'], ['E05.318.308.985.550.325', 'N01.224.935.698.201', 'N06.850.505.400.975.550.325', 'N06.850.520.308.985.550.325'], ['C01.160.495', 'C05.116.165.495'], ['C01.150.252.410.868'], ['B03.300.390.400.800.750.100', 'B03.353.500.750.750.100', 'B03.510.100.750.750.100', 'B03.510.400.790.750.100']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]']",0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
Simple mastectomy under hypnosis: A case study approach.,"There is a clear inverse relationship between preoperative anxiety and effective anaesthesia and recovery. Studies have shown that perioperative anxiety can be detrimental to the efficacy of recovery. In order to mitigate the perioperative anaesthetic risk to the patient, perioperative care must be inclusive of psychological as well as physiological elements. Therefore, when planning and implementing care for the surgical patient alternative interventions, such as hypnosis, should be considered when presented with difficult patient factors, such as crippling anxiety. This article takes on a case study approach to critically analyse and appraise the holistic care of a patient undergoing a simple mastectomy with hypnosis as the primary anaesthesia.","['Anesthesia', 'Anxiety', 'Humans', 'Hypnosis', 'Mastectomy, Simple', 'Perioperative Care']",29328737,"[['E03.155'], ['F01.470.132'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E02.190.525.217', 'F04.754.424'], ['E04.466.754'], ['E02.760.731', 'E04.604', 'N02.421.585.722']]","['Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Health Care [N]']",0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
No germline FH mutations in familial breast cancer patients.,"Fumarate hydratase: (FH) was recently identified as the predisposing gene for a tumor predisposition syndrome, hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell cancer (HLRCC) (MIM 605839). In HLRCC, individuals with a germline heterozygous mutation in the FH gene typically develop benign leiomyomas of the skin and the uterus (fibroids, myomas). In a subset of the families, predisposition to renal cell carcinoma and uterine leiomyosarcoma occurs. Other malignancies including breast cancer have also been detected in patients with a germline FH mutation. To examine whether FH could be involved in predisposition to breast cancer, we analyzed germline FH mutations from 85 Finnish breast cancer patients. Most of the cases were selected based on positive family or personal history for malignancies associated with HLRCC. No mutations were found. These results show that FH is not a major predisposing gene for familial breast cancer.","['Breast Neoplasms', 'Female', 'Fumarate Hydratase', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Germ-Line Mutation', 'Humans']",15523491,"[['C04.588.180', 'C17.800.090.500'], ['D08.811.520.241.300.300'], ['C23.550.291.687.500', 'G05.380.355'], ['G05.365.590.350'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400']]","['Diseases [C]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]']",0,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Education and lifestyle predict change in dietary patterns and diet quality of adults 55 years and over.,"BACKGROUND: Diet is a key risk factor for chronic disease, and an increasing concern among older adults. We aim to examine the changes in dietary patterns using principal component analysis and a diet quality index among older adults and examine the predictors of dietary change over a 4 year period.METHODS: Data was obtained via a postal survey in a prospective cohort, the Wellbeing Eating and Exercise for a Long Life (WELL) study. Australian adults aged 55 years and over (n = 1005 men and n = 1106 women) completed a food frequency at three time points and provided self-reported personal characteristics. Principal component analysis was used to assess dietary patterns and diet quality was assessed using the 2013 Revised Dietary Guideline Index. The relationships between predictors and change in dietary patterns were assessed by multiple linear regression.RESULTS: Two dietary patterns were consistently identified in men and women at three time points over 4 years. One was characterised by vegetables, fruit and white meat, and the other was characterised by red and processed meat and processed foods. Reduced consumption of key food groups within the principal component analysis-determined dietary patterns was observed. An increase in diet quality over 4 years was observed in men only. Reported higher education levels and favourable lifestyle characteristics, including not smoking and physical activity, at baseline predicted an increase in healthier dietary patterns over 4 years.CONCLUSIONS: There was stability in the main dietary patterns identified over time, however participants reported an overall decrease in the frequency of consumption of key food groups. Compliance with the Australian Dietary Guidelines remained poor and therefore targeting this population in nutritional initiatives is important. Design of nutrition promotion for older adults need to consider those with lower socioeconomic status, as having a lower level of education was a predictor of poorer dietary patterns. It is important to consider how nutrition behaviours can be targeted alongside other lifestyle behaviours, such as smoking and inadequate physical activity to improve health.","['Aged', 'Australia', 'Cohort Studies', 'Diet', 'Diet Surveys', 'Educational Status', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Life Style', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nutritional Status', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Prospective Studies']",31699092,"[['M01.060.116.100'], ['Z01.639.100', 'Z01.678.100.373'], ['E05.318.372.500.750', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750'], ['G07.203.650.240'], ['E05.318.308.980.485.350', 'N05.715.360.300.800.469.300', 'N06.850.505.616.300', 'N06.850.520.308.980.469.350'], ['N01.824.196'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['F01.829.458'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['G07.203.650.650', 'N01.224.425.525'], ['E05.318.740.562'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.625', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.650', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.650']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]']",0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1
Iodixanol versus Iopromide at Coronary CT Angiography: Lumen Opacification and Effect on Heart Rhythm-the Randomized IsoCOR Trial.,"Purpose To show that equal coronary lumen opacification can be achieved with iso- and low-osmolar contrast media when it is injected at the same iodine delivery rate with contemporary cardiac computed tomographic (CT) protocols and to investigate the cardiovascular effect of iso-osmolar contrast media and the image quality achieved. Materials and Methods Institutional review board approval and written informed consent were obtained for the Effect of Iso-osmolar Contrast Medium on Coronary Opacification and Heart Rhythm in Coronary CT Angiography, or IsoCOR, trial. Between November 2015 and August 2016, 306 patients (167 [55%] women) at least 18 years old (weight range, 50-125 kg), were prospectively randomized to receive iso-osmolar iodixanol 270 or low-osmolar iopromide 300 contrast media. All coronary segments were assessed for intraluminal opacification and image quality and were compared by using the Student t test. Heart rate, arrhythmia, patient discomfort, and adverse events also were monitored. Results Mean measured coronary attenuation values ± standard deviation were comparable between the iodixanol 270 and iopromide 300 contrast media groups (469 HU ± 167 vs 447 HU ± 166, respectively [P = .241]; 95% confidence interval: -15.1, 60.0), including those from subanalyses. Adjusted for the lower iodine concentration, the mean iodixanol 270 bolus was larger compared with that of iopromide 300 (76.8 mL ± 11.6 vs 69.7 mL ± 10.8, respectively; P < .001). The higher injection rate was associated with higher pressure (777 kPa ± 308 vs 630 kPa ± 252, respectively; P < .001). Although in the iodixanol 270 group patients experienced less heat discomfort (72% vs 86%, respectively; P < .001), no differences in heart rate or rhythm were observed. Conclusion If injected at comparable iodine delivery rates, the iso-osmolar contrast medium iodixanol 270 is not inferior to low-osmolar contrast medium iopromide 300 for assessment of coronary opacification. Iodixanol 270 was associated with less heat discomfort, but did not affect heart rate differently compared with iopromide 300. © RSNA, 2017 Online supplemental material is available for this article.","['Adult', 'Blood Pressure', 'Computed Tomography Angiography', 'Contrast Media', 'Coronary Angiography', 'Female', 'Heart Rate', 'Humans', 'Iohexol', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Risk Factors', 'Triiodobenzoic Acids']",28809582,"[['M01.060.116'], ['E01.370.600.875.249', 'G09.330.380.076'], ['E01.370.350.350.810.335', 'E01.370.350.567.250', 'E01.370.350.600.350.700.810.335', 'E01.370.350.700.700.810.335', 'E01.370.350.700.810.810.568', 'E01.370.350.825.810.810.499'], ['D27.505.259.500', 'D27.720.259'], ['E01.370.350.130.625', 'E01.370.350.700.060.200', 'E01.370.370.050.200', 'E01.370.370.380.200'], ['E01.370.600.875.500', 'G09.330.380.500'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D02.241.223.100.400.880.400', 'D02.455.426.559.389.127.375.880.400'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['E05.318.740.600.800.725', 'N05.715.350.200.700', 'N05.715.360.750.625.700.700', 'N06.850.490.625.750', 'N06.850.520.830.600.800.725'], ['D02.241.223.100.400.880', 'D02.455.426.559.389.127.375.880']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Health Care [N]']",0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
Meat intake frequency and anemia in Japanese children and adolescents.,"The consumption of meat products is considered to be a feasible solution to prevent anemia, which is a critical health problem. The present study assessed hematological parameters and the prevalence of anemia in Japanese children and adolescents, and examined the association with the frequency of meat intake. Data from the Shunan Children Health Cohort Study were analyzed. The participants included male and female residents, 3373 children (aged 10-11 years), and 3085 adolescents (aged 13-14 years). The frequency of meat intake was determined with a questionnaire, and blood samples were analyzed. Anemia was defined according to the criteria of the World Health Organization. The prevalence of anemia in children was 3.6% and 2.5% in girls and boys, respectively, and in adolescents, it was 4.5% in girls and 0.8% in boys. The frequency of meat intake did not show a positive association with the hematological indices or the prevalence of anemia. These results suggest that the promotion of meat consumption is not an effective strategy to decrease anemia, and that other approaches are necessary to prevent anemia in this population.","['Adolescent', 'Anemia', 'Child', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Diet', 'Diet Records', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Japan', 'Male', 'Meat', 'Prevalence']",22435780,"[['M01.060.057'], ['C15.378.071'], ['M01.060.406'], ['E05.318.372.500.875', 'N05.715.360.330.500.875', 'N06.850.520.450.500.875'], ['G07.203.650.240'], ['N04.452.859.360'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['Z01.252.474.463', 'Z01.639.595'], ['G07.203.300.600', 'J02.500.600'], ['E05.318.308.985.525.750', 'N01.224.935.597.750', 'N06.850.505.400.975.525.750', 'N06.850.520.308.985.525.750']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]']",0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,1
A comparison of widowhood and well-being among older Greek and British-Australian migrant women.,"The impact of widowhood on well-being has been well-documented, but to date has not focused extensively on the experience of older migrants who have aged in a foreign land. This study aimed to examine the well-being of older migrant widows from two groups in South Australia: British-born (n=61) and Greek-born (n=60) Australian migrants, who had been widowed, on average, 13 years. All participants completed a self-report questionnaire in their preferred language. Three indicators of current well-being (self-rated health, depression and loneliness) as well as variables expected to differ cross-culturally, and potentially influence well-being (mourning rituals; continuing bonds to one's spouse; religiosity; social support) were measured. Greek-born widows displayed higher levels of mourning rituals, continuing bonds and religiosity than the British. Both groups perceived similarly high levels of familial social support. Greek widows also reported worse self-rated health, and increased symptoms of depression and loneliness compared to the British. This paper suggests that the detrimental impact of widowhood on well-being may be greater for non-English speaking migrants who are ageing outside of their country of origin, and who, despite residing in an English-speaking host country for several decades, have retained the linguistic, cultural and religious practices and traditions of their home country.","['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Bereavement', 'Ceremonial Behavior', 'Depressive Disorder', 'Family Relations', 'Female', 'Greece', 'Health Status', 'Humans', 'Loneliness', 'Middle Aged', 'Religion', 'Social Support', 'South Australia', 'Transients and Migrants', 'United Kingdom', 'Widowhood']",24300071,"[['M01.060.116.100'], ['M01.060.116.100.080'], ['F01.470.142'], ['F01.145.813.097', 'I01.076.201.450.170'], ['F03.600.300'], ['F01.829.263.370', 'I01.880.853.150.439'], ['Z01.542.383'], ['I01.240.425', 'N01.224.425', 'N06.850.505.400.425'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['F01.470.713', 'I01.880.853.748.435'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['K01.844'], ['I01.880.853.500.600'], ['Z01.639.100.968', 'Z01.678.100.373.968'], ['M01.920'], ['Z01.542.363'], ['F01.829.263.315.500.862', 'I01.240.361.500.862', 'I01.880.853.150.423.500.862', 'N01.224.361.500.862', 'N01.824.308.500.862']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Humanities [K]']",0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1
Human kidney anion exchanger 1 interacts with kinesin family member 3B (KIF3B).,"Impaired trafficking of human kidney anion exchanger 1 (kAE1) to the basolateral membrane of á-intercalated cells of the kidney collecting duct leads to the defect of the Cl(-)/HCO(3)(-) exchange and the failure of proton (H(+)) secretion at the apical membrane of these cells, causing distal renal tubular acidosis (dRTA). In the sorting process, kAE1 interacts with AP-1 mu1A, a subunit of AP-1A adaptor complex. However, it is not known whether kAE1 interacts with motor proteins in its trafficking process to the plasma membrane or not. We report here that kAE1 interacts with kinesin family member 3B (KIF3B) in kidney cells and a dileucine motif at the carboxyl terminus of kAE1 contributes to this interaction. We have also demonstrated that kAE1 co-localizes with KIF3B in human kidney tissues and the suppression of endogenous KIF3B in HEK293T cells by small interfering RNA (siRNA) decreases membrane localization of kAE1 but increases its intracellular accumulation. All results suggest that KIF3B is involved in the trafficking of kAE1 to the plasma membrane of human kidney á-intercalated cells.","['Amino Acid Motifs', 'Anion Exchange Protein 1, Erythrocyte', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Kidney', 'Kinesin']",21871436,"[['G02.111.570.820.709.275.500', 'G02.111.570.820.709.600.500'], ['D12.776.157.530.450.162.193.500', 'D12.776.157.530.450.437.249.500', 'D12.776.157.530.937.656.249.500', 'D12.776.543.550.190.276.500', 'D12.776.543.550.779.249.500', 'D12.776.543.585.450.162.193.500', 'D12.776.543.585.450.437.249.500', 'D12.776.543.585.937.776.249.500'], ['E05.393.335.500'], ['A11.251.210.172.750', 'A11.436.334'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E05.196.150.639', 'E05.478.605'], ['A05.810.453'], ['D08.811.277.040.025.193.500', 'D12.776.220.600.450.450', 'D12.776.631.560.450']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Organisms [B]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Application of growth-related sublethal endpoints in ecotoxicological assessments using a harpacticoid copepod.,"In ecotoxicology, there is an increasing demand for sensitive sublethal endpoints. The primary aim of the present study was therefore to evaluate the relative sensitivity and usefulness of four sublethal endpoints - development time, body length, RNA content and growth rate - in the harpacticoid copepod Nitocra spinipes, using the reference molecule Simvastatin. Development time decreased significantly at low sublethal concentrations of Simvastatin (p < 0.001; F = 13.249; 0.16-1.6 microgL(-1)), while RNA content and body length increased significantly at 0.16 microgL(-1) (p < 0.001; F = 6.13) and 1.6 microgL(-1) (p < 0.01; F = 2.365), respectively. The growth rate increased significantly at 0.16-5 microgL(-1) (p<0.01-0.001). Hence, significant responses of growth-related traits were observed already at 0.16 microgL(-1), which is about 5,000 times lower than the acute toxicity (96 h-LC(50): 810 microgL(-1)). These results show that all assayed endpoints are very sensitive and indicate that current ecotoxicity testing used for environmental protection activities may underestimate the risk for harpacticoid copepods and most likely for other small invertebrates, when relying exclusively on acute toxicity measurements.","['Animals', 'Body Size', 'Copepoda', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Environmental Monitoring', 'Growth and Development', 'Mortality', 'RNA', 'Simvastatin', 'Time Factors', 'Toxicity Tests', 'Water Pollutants, Chemical']",16504314,"[['B01.050'], ['E01.370.600.115.100.160', 'E05.041.124.160', 'G07.100.100.160', 'G07.345.249.314'], ['B01.050.500.131.365.160'], ['G07.690.773.875', 'G07.690.936.500'], ['N06.850.460.350.080', 'N06.850.780.375'], ['G07.345'], ['E05.318.308.985.550', 'N01.224.935.698', 'N06.850.505.400.975.550', 'N06.850.520.308.985.550'], ['D13.444.735'], ['D02.455.426.559.847.638.400.900', 'D04.615.638.400.900'], ['G01.910.857'], ['E05.940'], ['D27.888.284.903.655']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]']",0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
Genome diversity of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 laboratory strains.,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 is the most commonly used strain for research on this ubiquitous and metabolically versatile opportunistic pathogen. Strain PAO1, a derivative of the original Australian PAO isolate, has been distributed worldwide to laboratories and strain collections. Over decades discordant phenotypes of PAO1 sublines have emerged. Taking the existing PAO1-UW genome sequence (named after the University of Washington, which led the sequencing project) as a blueprint, the genome sequences of reference strains MPAO1 and PAO1-DSM (stored at the German Collection for Microorganisms and Cell Cultures [DSMZ]) were resolved by physical mapping and deep short read sequencing-by-synthesis. MPAO1 has been the source of near-saturation libraries of transposon insertion mutants, and PAO1-DSM is identical in its SpeI-DpnI restriction map with the original isolate. The major genomic differences of MPAO1 and PAO1-DSM in comparison to PAO1-UW are the lack of a large inversion, a duplication of a mobile 12-kb prophage region carrying a distinct integrase and protein phosphatases or kinases, deletions of 3 to 1,006 bp in size, and at least 39 single-nucleotide substitutions, 17 of which affect protein sequences. The PAO1 sublines differed in their ability to cope with nutrient limitation and their virulence in an acute murine airway infection model. Subline PAO1-DSM outnumbered the two other sublines in late stationary growth phase. In conclusion, P. aeruginosa PAO1 shows an ongoing microevolution of genotype and phenotype that jeopardizes the reproducibility of research. High-throughput genome resequencing will resolve more cases and could become a proper quality control for strain collections.","['Amino Acid Substitution', 'Animals', 'Chromosome Inversion', 'Chromosomes, Bacterial', 'DNA, Bacterial', 'Female', 'Gene Duplication', 'Genetic Variation', 'Laboratories', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Physical Chromosome Mapping', 'Point Mutation', 'Pseudomonas Infections', 'Pseudomonas aeruginosa', 'Respiratory Tract Infections', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Virulence']",20023018,"[['E05.393.420.601.035', 'G05.558.109'], ['B01.050'], ['C23.550.210.190', 'G05.365.590.175.190', 'G05.365.590.770.500', 'G05.558.805.500'], ['A11.284.187.190', 'A20.812', 'G05.360.162.190'], ['D13.444.308.212'], ['G05.365.590.320', 'G05.558.320'], ['G05.365'], ['J03.520', 'N02.278.487'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500'], ['B01.050.050.199.520.520.388', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500.400.388'], ['L01.453.245.667'], ['E05.393.183.620'], ['G05.365.590.675'], ['C01.150.252.400.739'], ['B03.440.400.425.625.625.100', 'B03.660.250.580.590.050'], ['C01.748', 'C08.730'], ['E05.393.760.700'], ['G06.930']]","['Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Information Science [L]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0
Benzalkonium tolerance genes and outcome in Listeria monocytogenes meningitis.,"OBJECTIVES: Listeria monocytogenes is a food-borne pathogen that can cause meningitis. The listerial genotype ST6 has been linked to increasing rates of unfavourable outcome over time. We investigated listerial genetic variation and the relation with clinical outcome in meningitis.METHODS: We sequenced 96 isolates from adults with listerial meningitis included in two prospective nationwide cohort studies by whole genome sequencing, and evaluated associations between bacterial genetic variation and clinical outcome. We validated these results by screening listerial genotypes of 445 cerebrospinal fluid and blood isolates from patients over a 30-year period from the Dutch national surveillance cohort.RESULTS: We identified a bacteriophage, phiLMST6 co-occurring with a novel plasmid, pLMST6, in ST6 isolates to be associated with unfavourable outcome in patients (p 2.83e-05). The plasmid carries a benzalkonium chloride tolerance gene, emrC, conferring decreased susceptibility to disinfectants used in the food-processing industry. Isolates harbouring emrC were growth inhibited at higher levels of benzalkonium chloride (median 60 mg/L versus 15 mg/L; p <0.001), and had higher MICs for amoxicillin and gentamicin compared with isolates without emrC (both p <0.001). Transformation of pLMST6 into naive strains led to benzalkonium chloride tolerance and higher MICs for gentamicin.CONCLUSIONS: These results show that a novel plasmid, carrying the efflux transporter emrC, is associated with increased incidence of ST6 listerial meningitis in the Netherlands. Suggesting increased disease severity, our findings warrant consideration of disinfectants used in the food-processing industry that select for resistance mechanisms and may, inadvertently, lead to increased risk of poor disease outcome.","['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Anti-Infective Agents, Local', 'Benzalkonium Compounds', 'Cohort Studies', 'Drug Resistance, Bacterial', 'Female', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome, Bacterial', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Humans', 'Listeria monocytogenes', 'Male', 'Meningitis, Listeria', 'Middle Aged', 'Netherlands', 'Patient Outcome Assessment', 'Phylogeny', 'Plasmids', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Population Surveillance', 'Young Adult']",27998823,"[['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['M01.060.116.100.080'], ['D27.505.954.122.085'], ['D27.505.954.122.187'], ['D02.092.877.096.040', 'D02.675.276.080'], ['E05.318.372.500.750', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750'], ['G06.099.225', 'G06.225.347', 'G07.690.773.984.269.347'], ['G05.365'], ['G05.360.340.358.207'], ['E05.393.760.319'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['B03.353.500.500.500', 'B03.510.100.500.500', 'B03.510.460.400.410.485.500'], ['C01.150.252.223.500.500', 'C01.150.252.410.514.533', 'C01.207.180.500.500', 'C10.228.228.180.500.500', 'C10.228.614.280.449'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['Z01.542.651'], ['N04.761.559.590.399', 'N05.715.360.575.575.399'], ['G05.697', 'G16.075.605', 'L01.100.697'], ['G05.360.600'], ['G05.365.795.598'], ['E05.318.308.980.438.700', 'N05.715.360.300.800.438.625', 'N06.850.520.308.980.438.700', 'N06.850.780.675'], ['M01.060.116.815']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Information Science [L]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1
"Leadership, organizational stress, and emotional exhaustion among hospital nursing staff.","UNLABELLED: STUDY'S RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: We examined the effect of work stressors and head nurses' transactional and transformational leadership on the levels of emotional exhaustion experienced among their staff.METHODOLOGICAL DESIGN AND RESEARCH METHODS: A questionnaire was sent to all nurses of a university hospital. Usable returns were received from 625 nurses, giving a response rate of 39.2%. Data were treated using correlational analyses and multiple regression. The latter modelled stressors and leadership as predictors of nurses' reported emotional exhaustion.MEASURES: Work stressors were assessed using the Nursing Stress Scale (NSS) which comprises 34 items divided into three subscales (referring to stress from the physical, psychological, and social environment), and the role ambiguity (three items) and conflict (three items) scales. Leadership was measured with the Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire.RESULTS: In regression analyses, work stressors as a whole were found to explain 22% of the variance in emotional exhaustion whereas leadership dimensions explained 9% of the variance in that outcome measure. Stress emanating from the physical and social environment, role ambiguity, and active management-by-exception leadership were significantly associated with increased levels of emotional exhaustion. Transformational and contingent reward leadership did not influence emotional exhaustion.LIMITATIONS: A limitation of this study is that it considered only the emotional exhaustion dimension of burnout. Also, as data were cross-sectional in nature, conclusions regarding the direction of causality among variables cannot be drawn.CONCLUSIONS: This study provided, for the first time, a test of the influence of leadership on burnout among nurses, taking into account the role of work stressors. Future research is needed to examine if the effects reported herein can be replicated using the two other dimensions of burnout (depersonalization and reduced personal accomplishment).","['Adult', 'Belgium', 'Burnout, Professional', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interprofessional Relations', 'Leadership', 'Male', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Nursing Staff, Hospital', 'Regression Analysis', 'Role', 'Social Support', 'Task Performance and Analysis', 'Workload']",11529953,"[['M01.060.116'], ['Z01.542.115'], ['C24.580.500', 'F01.145.126.990.367.500', 'F02.830.900.333.500'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['F01.829.401.205'], ['F01.752.609'], ['E05.318.740.150.500', 'N05.715.360.750.125.500', 'N06.850.520.830.150.500'], ['M01.526.485.680.490', 'M01.526.485.740.523', 'N02.360.680.490', 'N02.360.740.523'], ['E05.318.740.750', 'N05.715.360.750.695', 'N06.850.520.830.750'], ['F01.829.316.616'], ['I01.880.853.500.600'], ['F02.784.412.846', 'F02.784.692.746', 'F02.808.600'], ['I03.946.225.500', 'N04.452.677.650.500']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]']",0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1
Experimental trichinellosis in horses: biological and parasitological evaluation.,"Three groups of three horses each were, respectively, infected with 5000, 20,000 and 50,000 larvae of Trichinella spiralis. The strain used was isolated from a human biopsy during horsemeat-related outbreaks of trichinellosis in France. Transient muscular disorders were only observed in two of the horses infected with 50,000 larvae but none of the horses had fever. A significant increase in blood eosinophils was noticed in 5 horses. Serum LDH, aldolase and CPK peaked at the fifth week post-infection. Specific IgG assayed by indirect immunofluorescence and ELISA, appeared 2-5 weeks post-infection and disappeared between 16 and 40 weeks. The distribution of T. spiralis larvae was maximal in the tongue, masseters and diaphragm, but a large decrease in the number of larvae recovered from the muscles was noticed among the horses slaughtered at the beginning and end of the experiment.

"Lack of small intestinal ulcerogenecity of nitric oxide-releasing indomethacin, NCX-530, in rats.","AIM: To evaluate the intestinal ulcerogenic property of nitric oxide-releasing indomethacin (NCX-530) in the rat, in comparison with indomethacin.METHODS: Animals were given indomethacin or NCX-530 subcutaneously and killed 24 h later for macroscopic examination of the small intestine.RESULTS: A single administration of indomethacin (10 mg/kg) provoked damage, mainly in the jejunum and ileum, accompanied by an increase in myeloperoxidase and inducible nitric oxide synthase activities as well as bacterial translocation. NCX-530 at an equimolar dose (14.2 mg/kg) caused no gross damage in the small intestine, nor any significant change in inducible nitric oxide synthase and myeloperoxidase activities or bacterial translocation. NOR-3, the nitric oxide donor (6.0 mg/kg), when administered subcutaneously together with indomethacin, significantly prevented the occurrence of intestinal lesions and other mucosal changes. Indomethacin reduced mucus and fluid secretions in the small intestine, while both NCX-530 and NOR-3 enhanced these secretions. NCX-530 reduced the mucosal prostaglandin E2 contents and exhibited an anti-inflammatory action against carrageenan-induced paw oedema, with equal effectiveness to indomethacin.CONCLUSION: NCX-530 does not cause intestinal damage, despite inhibiting cyclooxygenase activity. The reduced intestinal toxicity of NCX-530 may be attributable to inhibition of enterobacterial translocation, partly by increasing the mucus and fluid secretions mediated by nitric oxide released from this compound.","['Acetates', 'Animals', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal', 'Bacterial Translocation', 'Indoles', 'Indomethacin', 'Injections, Subcutaneous', 'Intestinal Mucosa', 'Intestine, Small', 'Male', 'Nitric Oxide', 'Nitric Oxide Synthase', 'Peroxidase', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley']",11148446,"[['D02.241.081.018', 'D10.251.400.045'], ['B01.050'], ['D27.505.696.663.850.014.040.500', 'D27.505.954.158.030', 'D27.505.954.329.030'], ['G06.099.114'], ['D03.633.100.473'], ['D03.633.100.473.420'], ['E02.319.267.530.620'], ['A03.556.124.369', 'A10.615.550.444'], ['A03.556.124.684'], ['D01.339.387', 'D01.625.550.500', 'D01.625.700.500', 'D01.650.550.587.600'], ['D08.811.682.664.500.772'], ['D08.811.682.732.700'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700.750']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Gorlin-Goltz syndrome.,"BACKGROUND: Gorlin-Goltz syndrome is an autosomal dominant inherited disorder characterized by a predisposition to various cancers. Clinicopathological findings of syndrome are very diverse and many symptoms begin to manifest in a certain period of life.CASE: The authors describe a case report of a man who, at the age of 34 years, presented to a dermatologist with multiple tumor lesions of the skin. The lesions started to develop when he was 30 years old and thereafter increased in number. Histology revealed superficial, superficial-nodular and nodular basal cell carcinomas. A total of 11 basal cell carcinomas were surgically removed and microscopically investigated. The others were treated locally with imiquimod cream and cryotherapy. In addition, he was found to have multiple odontogenic keratocysts in the jaw and mandible, as well as supernumerary and retinated teeth. Stomatologic and maxillofacial surgery interventions were performed. Further clinical and imaging examinations confirmed macrocephaly, hypertelorism, calcification of falx cerebri, and abnormalities of the cervical vertebrae. The spectrum of pathological findings met the diagnostic criteria of Gorlin-Goltz syndrome.CONCLUSION: Although Gorlin-Goltz syndrome is very rare in routine practice, it usually represents a serious disease with multiple organ system involvement. From a prognostic point of view, early diagnosis with adequate therapy is critical. If a diagnosis is confirmed, lifetime dispensary care with interdisciplinary medical cooperation is necessary. The authors would like to thank all physicians who participated in the diagnostics and therapy of the presented patient.

Polyviologen as Electron Transport Material in Photosystem I-Based Biophotovoltaic Cells.,"The photosynthetic protein complex, photosystem I (PSI), can be photoexcited with a quantum efficiency approaching unity and can be integrated into solar energy conversion devices as the photoactive electrode. The incorporation of PSI into conducting polymer frameworks allows for improved conductivity and orientational control in the photoactive layer. Polyviologens are a unique class of organic polycationic polymers that can rapidly accept electrons from a primary donor such as photoexcited PSI and subsequently can donate them to a secondary acceptor. Monomeric viologens, such as methyl viologen, have been widely used as diffusible mediators in wet PSI-based photoelectrochemical cells on the basis of their suitable redox potentials for accepting electrons. Polyviologens possess similar electronic properties to their monomers with the added advantage that they can shuttle electrons in the solid state. Depositing polyviologen directly onto a film of PSI protein results in significant photocurrent enhancement, which confirms its role as an electron-transport material. The polymer film not only improves the photocurrent by aiding the electron transfer but also helps preserve the protein film underneath. The composite polymer-PSI assembly enhances the charge-shuttling processes from individual protein molecules within the PSI multilayer, greatly reducing charge-transfer resistances. The resulting PSI-based solid-state platform demonstrates a much higher photocurrent than the corresponding photoelectrochemical cell built using a similar architecture.","['Bioelectric Energy Sources', 'Electrochemistry', 'Electrodes', 'Electrons', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Photosystem I Protein Complex', 'Polymers', 'Solar Energy', 'Viologens']",30495963,"[['E07.305.124.150'], ['H01.181.529.307'], ['E07.305.250'], ['G01.249.335', 'G01.358.500.750'], ['G02.700', 'G03.295.531'], ['D05.500.562.488.500', 'D08.811.600.710.500', 'D12.776.157.530.450.250.875.492', 'D12.776.543.585.450.250.875.492', 'D12.776.543.930.500.500', 'D12.776.765.199.750.750.500'], ['D05.750', 'D25.720', 'J01.637.051.720'], ['G01.750.897', 'N06.230.132.644.500'], ['D03.383.725.762.925']]","['Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]', 'Health Care [N]']",0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0
"Yours, mine, and ours: the importance of scientific collaboration in advancing the field of behavior change research.","The Behavior Change Consortium (BCC) has provided a unique opportunity to combine and explore resources, data, processes, and knowledge as a means of strengthening the validity, reliability, and outcomes that compose the field of behavioral science. The workgroups of the BCC were able to transcend disciplinary boundaries by developing a collaborative framework that fused scholarship and creativity to explore research problems in the area of health behavior change theory and intervention. We have identified seven common elements that emerged from each workgroup and fostered inclusion, progress, and ultimately results. These elements were (a) establishing communication channels, (b) identifying objectives, (c) utilizing common measures, (d) obtaining financial support, (e) seeking outside feedback, (f) engaging ""big picture"" thinking, and (g) bridging theory to practice. In this article we describe the various processes involved in the creation and sustainability of the BCC, including internal and external communications, leadership, workgroup roles, private and public partnerships, and issues associated with data sharing. We also discuss why, in the case of the BCC, the whole is far greater than the sum of its parts. We present this example of unparalleled multibehavioral research collaboration as a model to other collaborative efforts that will be spawned by the new National Institutes of Health Roadmap initiative.","['Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral Research', 'Cooperative Behavior', 'Feedback', 'Health Behavior', 'Humans', 'Interdisciplinary Communication', 'Peer Review']",15921484,"[['F04.754.137'], ['F04.096.144', 'H01.770.644.108'], ['F01.145.813.115'], ['L01.906.394.211'], ['F01.145.488'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['F01.829.401.205.249', 'L01.143.865.500'], ['F01.829.316.549', 'I01.880.604.640', 'N03.706.700']]","['Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Health Care [N]']",0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0
The pregnancy-induced increase of plasma angiotensin-(1-7) is blunted in gestational diabetes.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: It has been shown that the circulating Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS) is activated during normal pregnancy, but little is known about RAS in pregnancies complicated by gestational diabetes (GDM). GDM is considered not merely a temporary condition, but a harbinger of hypertension and type 2 diabetes. The aim of this study was to evaluate the circulating RAS profile in normotensive women with GDM at the third trimester of pregnancy and to compare the results with healthy pregnant and non-pregnant age-matched women.METHODS: The diagnostic criteria for GDM followed the recommendations of the American Diabetes Association. Angiotensin I (Ang I), Angiotensin II (Ang II) and Angiotensin 1-7 [Ang-(1-7)] were determined in 24 pregnant patients with GDM; 12 healthy pregnant women and 12 non-pregnant women by radioimmunoassay.RESULTS: Levels of Ang I, Ang II and Ang-(1-7) were higher in pregnant women (p<0.05), but showed a different pattern in the GDM group, in which reduced Ang-(1-7) circulating levels were found (p<0.05). This observation was confirmed by the significantly lower Ang-(1-7)/Ang I ratio (p<0.05).CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that reduced levels of the vasodilator Ang-(1-7) could be implicated in the endothelial dysfunction seen in gestational diabetic women during and after pregnancy.","['Adult', 'Angiotensin I', 'Angiotensin II', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Diabetes, Gestational', 'Female', 'Gestational Age', 'Humans', 'Peptide Fragments', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Complications, Cardiovascular', 'Pregnancy Trimester, Third', 'Radioimmunoassay', 'Renin-Angiotensin System']",17291601,"[['M01.060.116'], ['D06.472.699.094.075', 'D12.644.400.070.075', 'D12.644.456.073.021', 'D12.644.548.058.075', 'D12.776.631.650.070.075', 'D23.469.050.050.025'], ['D06.472.699.094.078', 'D12.644.400.070.078', 'D12.644.456.073.041', 'D12.644.548.058.078', 'D12.776.631.650.070.078', 'D23.469.050.050.050'], ['E05.318.372.500.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.500'], ['C13.703.170', 'C18.452.394.750.448', 'C19.246.200'], ['G07.345.500.325.235.968', 'G08.686.320'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D12.644.541'], ['G08.686.784.769'], ['C13.703.634', 'C14.583'], ['G08.686.707.520'], ['E01.370.384.700', 'E05.478.566.639', 'E05.601.470.639'], ['G03.820', 'G09.330.380.813']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
"Effect of fluconazole on pharmacokinetics of 2',3'-dideoxyinosine in persons seropositive for human immunodeficiency virus.","Fluconazole inhibits cytochrome P-450-mediated enzymatic metabolism of several drugs. Since hepatic metabolism is partially responsible for 2',3'-dideoxyinosine (didanosine or ddI) elimination, fluconazole therapy may lead to increased ddI concentrations in serum and subsequent concentration-dependent adverse effects. The purpose of this study was to determine if ddI pharmacokinetics are influenced by a 7-day course of oral fluconazole. Twelve adults with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) who had received a constant dosage of ddI for at least 2 weeks were investigated. On study day 1, multiple serum samples for determination of ddI concentrations were obtained over 12 h. Then subjects received a 7-day course of oral fluconazole (200 mg every 12 h for two doses and then 200 mg once daily for 6 days) while ddI therapy continued. Following the last dose of fluconazole, serum samples for determination of ddI concentrations were again obtained over 12 h. ddI concentrations in serum were analyzed by radioimmunoassay. In contrast to previously published data, there was marked between-subject variability in ddI areas under the concentration-time curve, even when the dose was normalized for weight. No significant differences were found between mean ddI areas under the concentration-time curve from 0 to 12 h on study day 1 (1,528 +/- 902 ngx.hr/ml) and following fluconazole treatment (1,486 +/- 649 ngx.hr/ml) . There were no significant differences in other pharmacokinetic parameters, such as ddI peak concentrations in serum (971 +/- 509 and 942 +/- 442 ng/ml) or half-lives (80 +/- 32 and 85 +/- 21 min.) before and after fluconazole treatment, respectively. We conclude that a 7-day course of oral fluconazole does not significantly alter ddI pharmacokinetics in adults that are infected with human immunodeficiency virus.","['Adult', 'Didanosine', 'Drug Interactions', 'Female', 'Fluconazole', 'HIV Seropositivity', 'Half-Life', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Radioimmunoassay']",7625787,"[['M01.060.116'], ['D03.633.100.759.590.616.130', 'D13.570.230.500.090', 'D13.570.583.616.130', 'D13.570.800.573.130'], ['G07.690.773.968'], ['D03.383.129.799.450'], ['C01.221.250.875.500', 'C01.221.812.640.400.500', 'C01.778.640.400.500', 'C01.925.782.815.616.400.500', 'C01.925.813.400.500', 'C20.673.480.500'], ['G01.910.405'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['E01.370.384.700', 'E05.478.566.639', 'E05.601.470.639']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
Soluble tumour-specific antigen and its relationship to tumour growth.,"Hooded rats bearing a syngeneic methylcholanthrene-induced tumour were evaluated for extent of in vivo host immunity and this was correlated by in vitro techniques with the levels of circulating tumour antigen and specific antibody. Early tumour growth was associated with detectable immunity, as measured by the capacity of the animal to reject a second direct challenge of the same tumour at a remote site. Radioimmunoassay for circulating tumour antigen and indirect membrane immunofluorescence for antitumour antibody did not detect either component at this stage. Animals with advanced tumours lost immunity as detected by direct tumour challenge, and this closely coincided with the appearance of rising levels of circulating soluble tumour antigen. Although the host possessed the immunologic ability to react against its own neoplasm, this ability was insufficient to produce tumour rejection. Active immunotherapy initiated at the time of, or up to 10 days after, intramuscular challenge with tumour, increased tumour immunity sufficiently for tumour growth to be prevented. Successful immunization was associated with the early appearance (16 days) of measurable levels of antitumour antibody and absence of circulating antigen. It is concluded that soluble tumour antigen present in the local microenvironment of the tumour in the early stages of tumour growth interferes with the ability of immune cells to cause tumour rejection. As the tumour progressively grows, sufficient soluble antigen is produced and released systemically to suppress the effector arm of the host's tumour immune response at distant sites. The levels of circulating soluble tumour antigen attained may be of critical importance in the suppression of rejection responses that prevent metastasis.","['Animals', 'Antibodies, Neoplasm', 'Antibody Specificity', 'Antigens, Neoplasm', 'BCG Vaccine', 'Epitopes', 'Graft Rejection', 'Immunization', 'Male', 'Methylcholanthrene', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred Strains', 'Sarcoma, Experimental', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",50290,"[['B01.050'], ['D12.776.124.486.485.114.240', 'D12.776.124.790.651.114.240', 'D12.776.377.715.548.114.240'], ['G12.100'], ['D23.050.285'], ['D20.215.894.135.825.100'], ['D23.050.550'], ['G12.875.545.328'], ['E02.095.465.425.400', 'E05.478.550', 'N02.421.726.758.310', 'N06.850.780.200.425', 'N06.850.780.680.310'], ['D02.455.426.559.847.149.500', 'D04.615.149.500'], ['E05.624'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700'], ['B01.050.050.199.520.760', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700.400'], ['C04.557.450.795.830', 'C04.619.857', 'E05.598.500.496.968'], ['E04.936.864']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Diseases [C]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

NDRG1 deficiency is associated with regional metastasis in oral cancer by inducing epithelial-mesenchymal transition.,"Regional metastasis is the single most important prognostic factor in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). Abnormal expression of N-myc downstream-regulated genes (NDRGs) has been identified to occur in several tumor types and to predict poor prognosis. In OSCC, the clinical significance of deregulated NDRG expression has not been fully established. In this study, NDRG1 relevance was assessed at gene and protein levels in 100 OSCC patients followed up by at least 10 years. Survival outcome was analyzed using a multivariable analysis. Tumor progression and metastasis was investigated in preclinical model using oral cancer cell lines (HSC3 and SCC25) treated with epidermal growth factor (EGF) and orthotopic mouse model of metastatic murine OSCC (AT84). We identified NDRG1 expression levels to be significantly lower in patients with metastatic tumors compared with patients with local disease only (P = 0.001). NDRG1 expression was associated with MMP-2, -9, -10 (P = 0.022, P = 0.002, P = 0.042, respectively) and BCL2 (P = 0.035). NDRG1 lower expression was able to predict recurrence and metastasis (log-rank test, P = 0.001). In multivariable analysis, the expression of NDRG1 was an independent prognostic factor (Cox regression, P = 0.013). In invasive OSCC cells, NDRG1 expression is diminished in response to EGF and this was associated with a potent induction of epithelial-mesenchymal transition phenotype. This result was further confirmed in an orthotopic OSCC mouse model. Together, this data support that NDRG1 downregulation is a potential predictor of metastasis and approaches aimed at NDRG1 signaling rescue can serve as potential therapeutic strategy to prevent oral cancer progression to metastasis.","['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell', 'Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Nude', 'Mouth Neoplasms', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Rate', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",32112078,"[['B01.050'], ['G04.146.954.035'], ['D23.101.140'], ['C04.557.470.200.400', 'C04.557.470.700.400'], ['D12.776.167'], ['G04.161.750', 'G07.345.249.410.750'], ['G04.356.500'], ['G05.308.370'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D12.644.360', 'D12.776.476'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500'], ['B01.050.050.199.520.520.338', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500.400.338'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500.550.500'], ['C04.588.443.591', 'C07.465.530'], ['C04.697.655', 'C23.550.727.655'], ['E01.789'], ['E05.318.308.985.550.900', 'N01.224.935.698.826', 'N06.850.505.400.975.550.900', 'N06.850.520.308.985.550.900'], ['A11.251.860'], ['E05.337.550.200.900', 'E05.624.850']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
Blood pressure and lifespan following brief ACE inhibitor treatment in young spontaneously hypertensive rats.,"1. Brief treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in young spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) causes a reduction in blood pressure that persists into maturity. The lifetime effects of such treatment have not been studied. 2. Nineteen male SHR were treated with either water (n = 9) or perindopril (3 mg/kg per day) (n = 10) by daily gavage between 6 and 10 weeks of age and systolic blood pressure and bodyweight were measured each month until all animals died in old age. 3. Following treatment the systolic blood pressure of SHR treated with perindopril remained consistently lower than control SHR until about 82 weeks of age. After this age the blood pressure of control SHR fell spontaneously so that smaller differences were observed between the two groups in the last 4 months of the study. 4. Rats that received perindopril lived on average 1 month longer than control rats, but this difference was not statistically significant. 5. Thus, brief ACE inhibition in early life in SHR ameliorated the hypertension throughout life.","['Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors', 'Animals', 'Blood Pressure', 'Body Weight', 'Indoles', 'Life Expectancy', 'Male', 'Perindopril', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred SHR']",8039264,"[['D27.505.519.389.745.085'], ['B01.050'], ['E01.370.600.875.249', 'G09.330.380.076'], ['C23.888.144', 'E01.370.600.115.100.160.120', 'E05.041.124.160.750', 'G07.100.100.160.120', 'G07.345.249.314.120'], ['D03.633.100.473'], ['E05.318.308.985.450', 'N01.224.935.464', 'N06.850.505.400.975.450', 'N06.850.520.308.985.450'], ['D03.633.100.473.766'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700'], ['B01.050.050.199.520.760.300', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700.400.300']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Health Care [N]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
Neuropeptide FF receptors 1 and 2 exert an anti-opioid activity in acutely dissociated rat dorsal raphe and periventricular hypothalamic neurones.,"We measured the reduction by nociceptin of the [Ca(2+)](i) transient triggered by depolarization in acutely dissociated neurones of the rat dorsal raphe and periventricular hypothalamic nuclei that express NPFF(2) and NPFF(1) receptors, respectively, in the absence and presence of 10 nM of NPA-NPFF or NPVF, two peptides selective for NPFF(2) and NPFF(1) receptors, respectively. In dorsal raphe neurones, NPA-NPFF reduces the inhibition of Ca(2+) conductances by nociceptin while NPVF is inactive. In periventricular hypothalamic neurones, both peptides reduce the inhibition of Ca(2+) transients by nociceptin, NPVF having a significantly larger effect than NPA-NPFF. These results demonstrate that activation of both NPFF(1) and NPFF(2) receptors has the same cellular anti-opioid effect.","['Animals', 'Humans', 'Neural Inhibition', 'Neurons', 'Opioid Peptides', 'Paraventricular Hypothalamic Nucleus', 'Raphe Nuclei', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Receptors, Neuropeptide']",12932818,"[['B01.050'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['G07.265.755', 'G11.561.616'], ['A08.675', 'A11.671'], ['D12.644.400.575', 'D12.776.631.650.575'], ['A08.186.211.180.497.342.400', 'A08.186.211.200.317.357.342.400'], ['A08.186.211.132.659.413.875.618', 'A08.186.211.132.810.428.600.650.562', 'A08.186.211.132.810.591.500.662'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700.750'], ['D12.776.543.750.720.600', 'D12.776.543.750.750.555']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]']",1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Hybridization of evolutionary algorithms and local search by means of a clustering method.,"This paper presents a hybrid evolutionary algorithm (EA) to solve nonlinear-regression problems. Although EAs have proven their ability to explore large search spaces, they are comparatively inefficient in fine tuning the solution. This drawback is usually avoided by means of local optimization algorithms that are applied to the individuals of the population. The algorithms that use local optimization procedures are usually called hybrid algorithms. On the other hand, it is well known that the clustering process enables the creation of groups (clusters) with mutually close points that hopefully correspond to relevant regions of attraction. Local-search procedures can then be started once in every such region. This paper proposes the combination of an EA, a clustering process, and a local-search procedure to the evolutionary design of product-units neural networks. In the methodology presented, only a few individuals are subject to local optimization. Moreover, the local optimization algorithm is only applied at specific stages of the evolutionary process. Our results show a favorable performance when the regression method proposed is compared to other standard methods.","['Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biological Evolution', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Information Storage and Retrieval', 'Nonlinear Dynamics', 'Pattern Recognition, Automated', 'Regression Analysis']",16761808,"[['G17.035', 'L01.224.050'], ['G17.035.250', 'L01.224.050.375'], ['G05.045', 'G16.075'], ['E05.318.740.250', 'N05.715.360.750.200', 'N06.850.520.830.250'], ['L01.313.500.750.280', 'L01.470'], ['E05.599.850', 'H01.548.675'], ['L01.399.750'], ['E05.318.740.750', 'N05.715.360.750.695', 'N06.850.520.830.750']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]']",0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0
Comparison of adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) and Gaussian processes for machine learning (GPML) algorithms for the prediction of skin temperature in lower limb prostheses.,"Monitoring of the interface temperature at skin level in lower-limb prosthesis is notoriously complicated. This is due to the flexible nature of the interface liners used impeding the required consistent positioning of the temperature sensors during donning and doffing. Predicting the in-socket residual limb temperature by monitoring the temperature between socket and liner rather than skin and liner could be an important step in alleviating complaints on increased temperature and perspiration in prosthetic sockets. In this work, we propose to implement an adaptive neuro fuzzy inference strategy (ANFIS) to predict the in-socket residual limb temperature. ANFIS belongs to the family of fused neuro fuzzy system in which the fuzzy system is incorporated in a framework which is adaptive in nature. The proposed method is compared to our earlier work using Gaussian processes for machine learning. By comparing the predicted and actual data, results indicate that both the modeling techniques have comparable performance metrics and can be efficiently used for non-invasive temperature monitoring.","['Amputees', 'Artificial Limbs', 'Fuzzy Logic', 'Lower Extremity', 'Neural Networks, Computer', 'Normal Distribution', 'Skin Temperature']",27452775,"[['M01.150.100'], ['E07.695.050', 'E07.858.082.050', 'E07.858.442.050'], ['E05.599.250', 'K01.752.448.250', 'L01.224.050.375.250'], ['A01.378.610'], ['G17.485', 'L01.224.050.375.605'], ['E05.318.740.994.500', 'G17.820.500', 'N05.715.360.750.750.565', 'N06.850.520.830.994.500'], ['G07.110.753', 'G13.750.844']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Humanities [K]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Health Care [N]']",1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0
"Monoclonal antibodies specific for the tau subunit of the DNA polymerase III holoenzyme of Escherichia coli.

Both antibodies have been purified and identified to be of the IgG1 class. Competition assays indicate that they bind to two distinct portions of the tau subunit. These antibodies have been used to demonstrate that tau is an integral part of all DNA polymerase III holoenzyme assemblies and that tau is the product of the dnaZX gene. Both of the antibodies react only with tau, not with gamma, the other protein product of the dnaZX gene. Immunoprecipitation studies demonstrated that tau is contained within the same enzyme assemblies as gamma (dnaZ protein). This observation is discussed in the light of the DNA polymerase III holoenzyme functioning as an asymmetric dimer, capable of coordinating leading with lagging strand replication.","['Antibodies, Bacterial', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Bacterial Proteins', 'DNA Polymerase III', 'DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase', 'Escherichia coli', 'Genes', 'Genes, Bacterial', 'Multienzyme Complexes']",3040763,"[['D12.776.124.486.485.114.107', 'D12.776.124.790.651.114.125', 'D12.776.377.715.548.114.125'], ['D12.776.124.486.485.114.224', 'D12.776.124.790.651.114.224', 'D12.776.377.715.548.114.224'], ['D12.776.097'], ['D08.811.913.696.445.308.300.235'], ['D08.811.913.696.445.308.300'], ['B03.440.450.425.325.300', 'B03.660.250.150.180.100'], ['G05.360.340.024.340'], ['G05.360.340.024.340.364.249', 'G05.360.340.358.024.249', 'G05.360.340.358.207.249'], ['D05.500.562', 'D08.811.600']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Predominantly night-time feeding and maternal glycaemic levels during pregnancy.,"Little is known about the influence of meal timing and energy consumption patterns throughout the day on glucose regulation during pregnancy. We examined the association of maternal feeding patterns with glycaemic levels among lean and overweight pregnant women. In a prospective cohort study in Singapore, maternal 24-h dietary recalls, fasting glucose (FG) and 2-h postprandial glucose (2HPPG) concentrations were measured at 26-28 weeks of gestation. Women (n 985) were classified into lean (BMI<23 kg/m2) or overweight (BMI?23 kg/m2) groups. They were further categorised as predominantly daytime (pDT) or predominantly night-time (pNT) feeders according to consumption of greater proportion of energy content from 07.00 to 18.59 hours or from 19.00 to 06.59 hours, respectively. On stratification by weight status, lean pNT feeders were found to have higher FG than lean pDT feeders (4·36 (sd 0·38) v. 4·22 (sd 0·35) mmol/l; P=0·002); however, such differences were not observed between overweight pDT and pNT feeders (4·49 (sd 0·60) v. 4·46 (sd 0·45) mmol/l; P=0·717). Using multiple linear regression with confounder adjustment, pNT feeding was associated with higher FG in the lean group (â=0·16 mmol/l; 95 % CI 0·05, 0·26; P=0·003) but not in the overweight group (â=0·02 mmol/l; 95 % CI -0·17, 0·20; P=0·879). No significant association was found between maternal feeding pattern and 2HPPG in both the lean and the overweight groups. In conclusion, pNT feeding was associated with higher FG concentration in lean but not in overweight pregnant women, suggesting that there may be an adiposity-dependent effect of maternal feeding patterns on glucose tolerance during pregnancy.","['Adiposity', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Blood Glucose', 'Body Mass Index', 'Diabetes, Gestational', 'Energy Intake', 'Feeding Behavior', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Linear Models', 'Overweight', 'Postprandial Period', 'Pregnancy', 'Prospective Studies', 'Reference Values', 'Young Adult']",26949026,"[['E01.370.600.115.100.062.500', 'G02.111.130.134.500', 'G03.180.134.500', 'G07.100.049.134.500'], ['M01.060.057'], ['M01.060.116'], ['D09.947.875.359.448.500'], ['E01.370.600.115.100.125', 'E05.041.124.125', 'G07.100.100.125', 'N06.850.505.200.100.175'], ['C13.703.170', 'C18.452.394.750.448', 'C19.246.200'], ['G07.203.650.240.340'], ['F01.145.113.547', 'F01.145.407', 'G07.203.650.353'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E05.318.740.500.500', 'E05.318.740.750.425', 'E05.599.835.750', 'N05.715.360.750.530.460', 'N05.715.360.750.695.460', 'N06.850.520.830.500.500', 'N06.850.520.830.750.425'], ['C23.888.144.699', 'E01.370.600.115.100.160.120.699', 'G07.100.100.160.120.699'], ['G10.261.700'], ['G08.686.784.769'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.625', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.650', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.650'], ['E05.978.810'], ['M01.060.116.815']]","['Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Organisms [B]']",0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
Generalized SMASH imaging.,"A generalized parallel imaging method has been developed that uses coil profiles to generate missing k-space lines. The proposed method is an extension of SMASH, which uses linear combinations of coil sensitivity profiles to synthesize spatial harmonics. In the generalized SMASH approach described here, coil sensitivity profiles are represented directly in the Fourier domain to provide a general description of the spatial properties of the coils. This removes restrictions imposed by conventional SMASH, so that the choice and position of the receiver coils can be made on the basis of sensitivity to the volume of interest rather than suitability for constructing spatial harmonics. Generalized SMASH also intrinsically allows the freedom to accommodate acquisitions with uniform or nonuniform k-space sampling. The proposed method places SMASH on an equal footing with other parallel imaging techniques (SENSE and SPACE-RIP), while combining strengths from each. The method was tested on phantom and human data and provides a robust method of data recovery.","['Fourier Analysis', 'Humans', 'Image Processing, Computer-Assisted', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Phantoms, Imaging']",11754455,"[['E05.377', 'G17.226', 'L01.224.800.625'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['L01.224.308'], ['E01.370.350.825.500'], ['E07.671']]","['Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Organisms [B]']",0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
Characterization of an equine mannose-binding lectin and its roles in disease.,"The mannose-binding lectin (MBL), a pattern recognition serum protein, participates in the innate immune system of mammals as an opsonin. In humans, MBL plays a key role in first-line host defense against infection during the lag period prior to the development of a specific immune response. MBL also activates complement via the lectin pathway that requires a MBL-associated serine protease-2 (MASP-2). Homologues of human MBL (hMBL) have been identified in a variety of mammals, fish, and primitive animals such as ascidians. In this study, we report that equine MBL (eMBL) has properties that are similar to hMBL. In addition, we found low levels of MBL:MASP activity in sick horses compared to healthy horses. These results suggest that eMBL is involved in the immune response of the horse and that low MBL:MASP activity could be used to monitor immune function and clinical outcome.","['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Female', 'Horse Diseases', 'Horses', 'Mannose-Binding Lectins', 'Mannose-Binding Protein-Associated Serine Proteases', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Phylogeny', 'Sequence Alignment']",16574074,"[['G02.111.570.060', 'L01.453.245.667.060'], ['B01.050'], ['G02.111.570.080', 'G05.360.080', 'L01.453.245.667.080'], ['C22.488'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.984.235.472'], ['D12.776.503.311'], ['D08.811.277.656.300.760.501', 'D08.811.277.656.959.350.501', 'D12.776.124.486.274.045.387.875'], ['L01.453.245.667'], ['G05.697', 'G16.075.605', 'L01.100.697'], ['E05.393.751']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
Life after funding: a strategy for survival of a program to prevent substance abuse.,"Problems associated with the use of alcohol and other drugs are among the most serious public health threats found on college and university campuses in the United States. The United States Department of Education's Fund for the Improvement of Postsecondary Education program has supported a nationwide effort among colleges and universities to address these problems. A key issue facing programs to prevent substance abuse is their prospect for survival as grant funding ends. In this article, the survival of one college-based alcohol and other drug prevention program and its move toward institutionalization in an extremely challenging fiscal environment are examined. The strategies described by the authors may be helpful for directors of other programs facing similar challenges.","['Alcoholism', 'California', 'Cost Control', 'Fund Raising', 'Humans', 'Organizations, Nonprofit', 'Student Health Services', 'Substance-Related Disorders', 'United States']",8908882,"[['C25.775.100.250', 'F03.900.100.350'], ['Z01.107.567.875.580.200', 'Z01.107.567.875.760.200'], ['N03.219.151.160'], ['N03.219.463.360'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['N03.540.630'], ['N02.421.897'], ['C25.775', 'F03.900'], ['Z01.107.567.875']]","['Diseases [C]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]']",0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1
Antagonism of morphine analgesia by prolyl-leucyl-glycinamide (MIF-1) in humans.,"Prolyl-leucyl-glycinamide (MIF-1) has been observed to inhibit the analgesic effect of morphine in a series of animal studies. In the present study, the naloxone-like properties of MIF-1 were assessed in human subjects. Eight men received a capsule containing 60 mg of MIF-1 or placebo followed one hour later by a 10 mg intramuscular injection of morphine in a double-blind, crossover design at two visits 4 weeks apart. Experimental pain was induced by the cold pressor test administered 45, 75, 120 and 180 min after the morphine. Each subject recorded severity of pain on a 100 mm line scale every 5 sec during the 120 sec his foot was immersed in the cold water tank and during the 60 seconds immediately following its removal. On a third visit, baseline values were measured in the absence of morphine, MIF-1 or placebo. Analysis of variance revealed that MIF-1 resulted in significantly higher scores (less analgesia) compared with placebo when measured at 45 and 75 min after morphine during the immersion phase and during all four times the subjects were evaluated during the removal phase. The results indicate that MIF-1 can act in humans as an opiate antagonist.","['Adult', 'Cold Temperature', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Humans', 'MSH Release-Inhibiting Hormone', 'Male', 'Morphine', 'Pain', 'Time Factors']",6151672,"[['M01.060.116'], ['G01.906.595.272', 'G16.500.275.063.725.710.300', 'G16.500.750.775.710.300', 'N06.230.300.100.725.154', 'N06.230.300.100.725.710.300'], ['E05.318.370.300', 'E05.581.500.300', 'N05.715.360.325.320', 'N06.850.520.445.300'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D06.472.699.327.700.500', 'D12.644.400.400.700.500', 'D12.644.548.365.700.500', 'D12.776.631.650.405.700.500'], ['D03.132.577.249.562.571', 'D03.605.497.607.587', 'D03.633.400.686.607.587', 'D04.615.723.795.576.571'], ['C23.888.592.612', 'F02.830.816.444', 'G11.561.790.444'], ['G01.910.857']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]']",0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
Chloroquine-Primaquine versus Chloroquine Alone to Treat Vivax Malaria in Afghanistan: An Open Randomized Superiority Trial.,"Afghanistan's national guidelines recommend primaquine (PQ) for radical treatment of Plasmodium vivax malaria, but this is rarely implemented because of concerns over potential hemolysis in patients who have G6PD deficiency. Between August 2009 and February 2014, we conducted an open-label, randomized controlled trial of chloroquine (CQ) alone versus chloroquine plus primaquine (0.25 mg base/kg/day for 14 days) (CQ+PQ) in patients aged 6 months and older with microscopy confirmed P. vivax infection. In the CQ+PQ group, G6PD deficiency was excluded by fluorescent spot testing. The primary outcome was P. vivax recurrence assessed by survival analysis over one year follow-up. Of 593 patients enrolled, 570 attended at or after 14 days of follow-up. Plasmodium vivax recurrences occurred in 37 (13.1%) of 282 patients in the CQ+PQ arm versus 86 (29.9%) of 288 in the CQ arm (Cox proportional hazard ratio [HR] 0.37, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.25-0.54) (intention-to-treat analysis). Protection against recurrence was greater in the first 6 months of follow-up (HR 0.082; 95% CI 0.029-0.23) than later (HR 0.65, 95% CI 0.41-1.03). Five of seven patients requiring hospital admission were considered possible cases of PQ-related hemolysis, and PQ was stopped in a further six; however, in none of these cases did hemoglobin fall by ? 2 g/dL or to below 7 g/dL, and genotyping did not detect any cases of Mediterranean variant G6PD deficiency. PQ 0.25 mg/kg/day for 14 days prevents relapse of P. vivax in Afghanistan. Patient visits during the first week may improve adherence. Implementation will require deployment of point-of-care phenotypic tests for G6PD deficiency.","['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Afghanistan', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antimalarials', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chloroquine', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Genotyping Techniques', 'Glucosephosphate Dehydrogenase Deficiency', 'Humans', 'Malaria, Vivax', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Plasmodium vivax', 'Point-of-Care Systems', 'Primaquine', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Prospective Studies', 'Recurrence', 'Sample Size', 'Young Adult']",29141719,"[['M01.060.057'], ['M01.060.116'], ['Z01.252.245.500.125'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['M01.060.116.100.080'], ['D27.505.954.122.250.100.085'], ['M01.060.406'], ['M01.060.406.448'], ['D03.633.100.810.050.180'], ['E02.319.310'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.249', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.350', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.350'], ['E05.393.442'], ['C15.378.071.141.150.480', 'C16.320.070.480', 'C16.320.565.202.402', 'C18.452.648.202.402'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C01.610.752.530.700', 'C01.920.875.700'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['B01.043.075.380.611.761'], ['N04.452.442.452.452.680', 'N04.452.515.360.652', 'N04.590.874'], ['D03.633.100.810.050.650'], ['E05.318.740.500.700', 'E05.318.740.600.700', 'E05.318.740.750.725', 'E05.318.740.998.825', 'E05.599.835.900', 'N05.715.360.750.530.650', 'N05.715.360.750.625.650', 'N05.715.360.750.695.650', 'N05.715.360.750.795.825', 'N06.850.520.830.500.700', 'N06.850.520.830.600.700', 'N06.850.520.830.750.725', 'N06.850.520.830.998.912'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.625', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.650', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.650'], ['C23.550.291.937'], ['E05.318.370.762', 'E05.581.500.902', 'N05.715.360.325.692', 'N06.850.520.445.762'], ['M01.060.116.815']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1

"Ultrasonographic ovarian dynamic, plasma progesterone, and non-esterified fatty acids in lame postpartum dairy cows.","The objective of this study was to compare ovulation rate, number of large ovarian follicles, and concentrations of plasma progesterone (P4) and non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA) between lame (n = 10) and non-lame (n = 10) lactating Holstein cows. The study was conducted in an organic dairy farm, and cows were evaluated by undertaking ultrasonography and blood sampling every 3 days from 30 days postpartum for a period of 34 days. Cows which became lame during the first 30 days postpartum experienced a lower ovulation rate determined by the presence of a corpus luteum (50% presence for lame cows and 100% for non-lame cows, p ? 0.05). The number of large ovarian follicles in the ovaries was 5 for lame cows and 7 for non-lame cows (p = 0.09). Compared to non-lame cows, lame cows had significantly lower (p ? 0.05) concentrations of plasma P4. Furthermore, NEFA concentrations were lower (p ? 0.05) in lame cows than in non-lame cows. It is concluded that lameness in postpartum dairy cows is associated with ovulation failure and lower concentrations of P4 and NEFA.","['Animals', 'Cattle', 'Cattle Diseases', 'Fatty Acids, Nonesterified', 'Female', 'Lameness, Animal', 'Ovarian Follicle', 'Ovulation', 'Progesterone', 'Ultrasonography']",29486532,"[['B01.050'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.500.380.271'], ['C22.196'], ['D10.251.310'], ['C22.510'], ['A05.360.319.114.630.535', 'A06.300.312.497.535'], ['G08.686.784.690'], ['D04.210.500.745.745.654.829', 'D06.472.334.734.623', 'D06.472.334.851.687.750'], ['E01.370.350.850']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Unveiling patterns of salary inequity: suggested measurement strategy for health care organizations.,"This paper focuses on how potential race related salary inequity and racial discrimination patterns can be measured in health care organizations. Incorporating ethical principals to the measurement strategy helps conceptualize potential patterns of salary inequity.

The most important benefit of the suggested strategies is the ability to assess and identify how discrimination may be occurring in organizations.","['Female', 'Health Facilities', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Minority Groups', 'Prejudice', 'Salaries and Fringe Benefits', 'Truth Disclosure', 'United States']",16803747,"[['N02.278'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['I01.880.853.300'], ['F01.145.813.550', 'F01.829.595'], ['N01.824.417.700', 'N04.452.677.800'], ['F01.829.401.046.800', 'I01.880.604.583.080.134.800'], ['Z01.107.567.875']]","['Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Geographicals [Z]']",0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1
Time course of the distribution of morphine in brain regions and spinal cord after intravenous injection to spontaneously hypertensive and normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats.,"Previous studies from this laboratory have demonstrated that the analgesic and hyperthermic effects of morphine were found to be greater in spontaneously hypertensive (SHR) rats than in normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats. The enhanced response to morphine could not be explained on the basis of any of the pharmacokinetic parameters of morphine in the serum. In order to determine the possible contribution of altered distribution of morphine in the central nervous system in the differences in the pharmacological response to morphine in the two strains, the time course of the distribution of morphine was determined in brain regions and spinal cord after its i.v. administration. SHR and WKY rats were injected with morphine (10 mg/kg). At various times (5, 30, 60, 120 and 360 min) after the injection of morphine, brain regions (hypothalamus, cortex, hippocampus, midbrain, pons and medulla, striatum and amygdala) and spinal cord were collected. The level of morphine in the tissues was determined by using a highly sensitive and specific radioimmunoassay method. Five minutes after morphine injection, the concentration of morphine was the highest in the spinal cord. Among the brain regions, the highest concentration of morphine was in the hypothalamus and the lowest in the amygdala. In all the brain regions and spinal cord, the concentration of morphine was significantly higher in the SHR than in the WKY rats. Similar effects were observed at 30, 60 and 120 min after morphine injection. At 360 min, the hypothalamus, cortex and spinal cord of the SHR rats had higher concentrations of morphine than the WKY rats, but the other regions did not show differences in the morphine levels.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Analgesia', 'Animals', 'Blood Pressure', 'Body Temperature', 'Brain', 'Injections, Intravenous', 'Male', 'Morphine', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred SHR', 'Rats, Inbred WKY', 'Species Specificity', 'Spinal Cord', 'Tissue Distribution']",1602368,"[['E03.091'], ['B01.050'], ['E01.370.600.875.249', 'G09.330.380.076'], ['E01.370.600.875.374', 'G07.110'], ['A08.186.211'], ['E02.319.267.082.750', 'E02.319.267.530.540'], ['D03.132.577.249.562.571', 'D03.605.497.607.587', 'D03.633.400.686.607.587', 'D04.615.723.795.576.571'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700'], ['B01.050.050.199.520.760.300', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700.400.300'], ['B01.050.050.199.520.760.390', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700.400.390'], ['G16.824'], ['A08.186.854'], ['G03.787.917', 'G07.690.725.949']]","['Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Usability of the revised NIOSH lifting equation.,"Following the revision of the 1981 National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) lifting equation, research needs related to the new equation were outlined. Aside from epidemiological studies, the need to evaluate the usability of the 1991 NIOSH equation in realistic work environments was expressed. This paper reports on extensive experiences with training users and application of the equation in varied work settings. Qualitative results from training sessions indicated that frequency, asymmetry and duration were the parameters that required relatively longer instruction periods and resulted in the most questions. Field applications indicated that the variable nature of lifting/lowering demands found in many jobs resulted in difficulty applying the equation. Approximately 35% of 1103 lifting and lowering tasks had at least one parameter outside of acceptable ranges, while a majority of workers (62.8%) reported other manual handling tasks that are counter to assumptions made in the development of the equation. The practical implications of the findings are discussed.","['Guideline Adherence', 'Humans', 'Inservice Training', 'Lifting', 'National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, U.S.', 'Occupational Health', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Task Performance and Analysis', 'United States']",12487684,"[['N04.761.337', 'N05.715.360.395'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['I02.574'], ['G01.374.669'], ['I01.409.418.750.600.650.200.520', 'N03.540.348.500.500.600.650.225.520'], ['N01.400.525'], ['E05.318.370.725', 'E05.337.851', 'N05.715.360.325.685', 'N06.850.520.445.725'], ['F02.784.412.846', 'F02.784.692.746', 'F02.808.600'], ['Z01.107.567.875']]","['Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Geographicals [Z]']",0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1
Managing care: utilization review in action at two capitated medical groups.,"Despite widespread concern about denials of coverage by managed care organizations, little empirical information exists on the profile and outcomes of utilization review decisions. This study examines the outcomes of nearly a half-million coverage requests in two large medical groups that contract with health plans to deliver care and conduct utilization review. We found much higher denial rates than those previously reported. Denials were particularly common for emergency care and durable medical equipment. Retrospective requests were nearly four times more likely than prospective requests were to be denied, and when prospective requests were denied, it was more likely because the service fell outside the scope of covered benefits than because it was not medically necessary.","['California', 'Group Practice, Prepaid', 'Humans', 'Insurance Claim Review', 'Insurance, Health, Reimbursement', 'Managed Care Programs', 'United States', 'Utilization Review']",14527261,"[['Z01.107.567.875.580.200', 'Z01.107.567.875.760.200'], ['N04.452.758.244.400'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['N03.219.521.576.215'], ['N03.219.521.576.343.480', 'N03.219.521.710'], ['N03.219.521.576.343.800', 'N04.590.374.410'], ['Z01.107.567.875'], ['N04.761.879', 'N05.700.900']]","['Geographicals [Z]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]']",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1

Relationship between Obstructive Sleep Apnea and Self-assessed Oral Health Status: An Internet Survey.,"The purpose of this study based on a cross-sectional internet survey was to investigate the relationship between risk of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and self-assessed oral health status. The participants, who comprised individuals registered with an online research company, were required to complete a self-reported questionnaire. Those answering in the affirmative to both of the following two questions were placed in the OSA-risk group, while those answering in the negative were assigned to the control group: 'Have other people noticed pauses in your breathing while you are sleeping?' and 'Do you feel excessively sleepy during the daytime?'. A total of 493 were included in the OSA-risk group and 2,560 in the control group. Among the total 3,053 respondents, the highest prevalence for OSA risk in men was in the 50-59-year age range, although this tended to level off after age 60 years. No such trend was observed in women, however. Multiple logistic regression analysis was performed to identify the relationship between risk of OSA and self-assessed oral health status. Significant correlations were observed with the following parameters: difficulty in opening mouth (odds ratio [OR]: 2.66; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.647-4.311), dry mouth (OR: 2.11; CI: 1.544-2.876), bad breath (OR: 1.69; CI: 1.309-2.186), gingival bleeding (OR: 1.48; CI: 1.134-1.932), and gingival swelling (OR: 1.44; CI: 1.046-1.981). These results suggest a relationship between risk of OSA and self-assessed oral health status, indicating that treating OSA might improve oral health status.

Liquid crystal forehead temperature strips. A clinical appraisal.,"We recently compared two brands of liquid crystal temperature strips, designed for application to the forehead, Clinitemp and Fever Scan, with recently calibrated rectal and oral glass thermometers in 134 children. The Clinitemp identified as febrile nine (28%) of 33 children who had fever verified by a glass thermometer. Five of seven children less than 2 years of age with rectal temperatures of 38.9 degree C or higher were identified as afebrile by the Clinitemp. The Fever Scan identified as febrile 26 (79%) of 33 children who had fever verified by a glass thermometer. One of six children less than 2 years of age with rectal temperatures of 38.9 degree C or higher was identified as afebrile by the Fever Scan. Parents who rely on these strips to identify a fever in their children may be misled by an erroneous afebrile reading.","['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Crystallization', 'Fever', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Thermometers']",7064942,"[['M01.060.057'], ['M01.060.406'], ['M01.060.406.448'], ['E05.196.300', 'G02.171'], ['C23.888.119.344'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.703'], ['E07.900']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]']",0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
[A familial outbreak of verotoxin-producing Escherichia coli O103:H2 infection in which a calf was the suspected infectious source].,"A familial outbreak of Verotoxin-producing Escherichia coli (VTEC) infection occurred in July 1996 in AKITA prefecture. Four VTEC strains harboring VT-1 and eaeA genes were isolated from three patients and a calf, breeding farm for which was located as close as 4 meters from the house where the patients lived in. All of the 4 VTEC isolates were serotyped as O63:H2 using commercially available sera kits. However, a patient isolate, EC-281, was serotyped as 0103:H2 at the International Escherichia and Klebsiella Centre. Titration and absorption tests using rabbit antisera raised against EC-281 confirmed that the serogroup of the remaining 3-VTEC isolates was also O103. Epidemiological characteristics including plasmid profile, antibiotic susceptibility patterns and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis patterns of the 4 VTEC isolates were completely the same, indicating that these isolates originated from a common source. These findings in conjunction with the results of epidemiological survey conducted by the Health Center suggested that a possible infectious source for this outbreak is the calf. Our present results strengthen the significance of calf as an infectious source of VTEC infection.","['Animals', 'Bacterial Toxins', 'Cattle', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Enterotoxins', 'Escherichia coli', 'Escherichia coli Infections', 'Family', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Japan', 'Male', 'Serotyping', 'Shiga Toxin 1', 'Zoonoses']",9745220,"[['B01.050'], ['D23.946.123'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.500.380.271'], ['M01.060.406'], ['M01.060.406.448'], ['N06.850.290'], ['D23.946.330'], ['B03.440.450.425.325.300', 'B03.660.250.150.180.100'], ['C01.150.252.400.310.330'], ['F01.829.263', 'I01.880.853.150'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.703'], ['Z01.252.474.463', 'Z01.639.595'], ['E01.370.225.812.742', 'E01.370.225.875.150.125.890', 'E05.200.812.742', 'E05.200.875.150.125.890', 'E05.478.594.780'], ['D08.811.277.450.430.700.750.750.120', 'D12.776.097.275.877', 'D23.946.123.794.100', 'D23.946.330.575.120'], ['C01.973', 'C22.969']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1
Effect of pH on the speciation and solubility of divalent metals in human and bovine milks.,"Computer models estimated the ligand speciation and solubility of calcium, magnesium, zinc, and copper over a pH range for low molecular weight fractions characteristic of either human or bovine milks. Above pH 4 calcium is the only metal predicted to precipitate. Most of the remaining soluble calcium, magnesium, and zinc should be complexed with citrate. The solubility of calcium, magnesium, and zinc in human and bovine milks was measured experimentally from pH 2 to 7. The solubility of all three metals decreased as the pH increased. Calcium and zinc were soluble over a narrower pH range in bovine milk than in human milk. Increasing the levels of either calcium or inorganic phosphate alone in decaseinated human milk did not affect the solubility of zinc, but when both calcium and inorganic phosphate were added at levels comparable to bovine milk the solubility of zinc decreased at the higher pH's. The decreased solubility of zinc in skimmed milks in pH's characteristic of the small intestine is likely due to coprecipitation of zinc with calcium phosphate--a reaction not predicted for milk systems from known chemical solubility product data.","['Animals', 'Biological Availability', 'Calcium', 'Caseins', 'Cattle', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Magnesium', 'Metals', 'Milk', 'Milk, Human', 'Solubility', 'Spectrophotometry, Atomic', 'Ultrafiltration', 'Zinc']",3701327,"[['B01.050'], ['G03.787.151', 'G07.690.725.129'], ['D01.268.552.100', 'D01.552.539.288', 'D23.119.100'], ['D12.776.256.159.750.207', 'D12.776.744.150'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.500.380.271'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['G02.300'], ['D01.268.552.437', 'D01.268.557.500', 'D01.552.547.500'], ['D01.552'], ['A12.200.455', 'A12.790', 'G07.203.100.700', 'G07.203.300.350.525', 'J02.200.700', 'J02.500.350.525'], ['A12.200.467', 'A12.790.500', 'G07.203.100.700.500', 'G07.203.300.350.525.500', 'J02.200.700.500', 'J02.500.350.525.500'], ['G02.805'], ['E05.196.712.726.551', 'E05.196.867.826.551'], ['E04.292.975', 'E05.196.454.807', 'G01.280.807', 'G02.263.807'], ['D01.268.556.940', 'D01.268.956.906', 'D01.552.544.940']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
Tobacco-Free Cigarette Smoke Exposure Induces Anxiety and Panic-Related Behaviours in Male Wistar Rats.,"Smokers, who generally present with lung damage, are more anxious than non-smokers and have an associated augmented risk of panic. Considering that lung damage signals specific neural pathways that are related to affective responses, the aim of the present study was to evaluate the influence of pulmonary injury on anxiety and panic-like behaviours in animals exposed to cigarette smoke with and without tobacco. Male Wistar rats were divided into the following groups: a control group (CG); a regular cigarette group (RC); and a tobacco-free cigarette (TFC) group. Animals were exposed to twelve cigarettes per day for eight consecutive days. The animals were then exposed to an elevated T-maze and an open field. The RC and TFC groups presented increases in inflammatory cell inflow, antioxidant enzyme activity, and TBARS levels, and a decrease in the GSH/GSSG ratio was observed in the TFC group. Exposure to RC smoke reduced anxiety and panic-related behaviours. On the other hand, TFC induced anxiety and panic-related behaviours. Thus, our results contradict the concept that nicotine is solely accountable for shifted behavioural patterns caused by smoking, in that exposure to TFC smoke causes anxiety and panic-related behaviours.","['Animals', 'Anxiety', 'Behavior, Animal', 'Male', 'Maze Learning', 'Panic', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar', 'Tobacco Smoke Pollution']",29563583,"[['B01.050'], ['F01.470.132'], ['F01.145.113'], ['F02.463.425.874.500'], ['F01.470.361.585'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700.900'], ['D20.633.937.680', 'N06.850.460.100.555']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Health Care [N]']",0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
Interactions of cantharidin-like inhibitors with human protein phosphatase-5 in a Mg2+,"The serine/threonine protein phosphatase type 5 (PP5) is a promising target for designing new antitumor drugs. This enzyme is a member of the PPP phosphatases gene family, which catalyzes a dephosphorylation reaction: a regulatory process in the signal transduction pathway that controls various biological processes. The aim of this work is to study and compare the inhibition of PP5 by ten cantharidin-like inhibitors in order to bring about contributions relevant to the better comprehension of their inhibitory activity. In this theoretical investigation, we used molecular dynamics techniques to understand the role of key interactions that occur in the protein active site; QM calculations were employed to study the interaction mode of these inhibitors in the enzyme. In addition, atoms in molecules (AIM) calculations were carried out to characterize the chemical bonds among the atoms involved and investigate the orbital interactions with their respective energy values. The obtained results suggest that the Arg275, Asn303, His304, His352, Arg400, His427, Glu428, Val429, Tyr451, and Phe446 residues favorably contribute to the interactions between inhibitors and PP5. However, the Asp271 and Asp244 amino acid residues do not favor such interactions for some inhibitors. Through the QM calculations, we can suggest that the reactional energy of the coordination mechanism of these inhibitors in the PP5 active site is quite important and is responsible for the inhibitory activity. The AIM technique employed in this work was essential to get a better comprehension of the transition states acquired from the mechanism simulation. This work offers insights of how cantharidin-like inhibitors interact with human PP5, potentially allowing the design of more specific and even less cytotoxic drugs for cancer treatments.

[Endovascular treatment of cerebral aneurysms with selectively detachable platinum coils].,"In 14 patients (eight men, six women; mean age 58 [31-72] years) with intracranial aneurysm (basilar artery in nine, anterior branches in five) the aneurysm was occluded by electrically detachable platinum coils, advanced into the aneurysm introduced via a percutaneously introduced catheter system, under local anaesthesia and fluoroscopic control. Ten patients had acute subarachnoid haemorrhage (stage II-IV). In two patients several sessions were required before complete occlusion was achieved. In one patient, with a basilar artery aneurysm, the aneurysmal wall was perforated (angiographically demonstrated contrast-medium extravasation), but this remained clinically asymptomatic. There has been no recurrence or renewed bleeding during a follow-up period of 6-12 months. The method is a highly promising addition to the micro-neurosurgical treatment of such aneurysms. However, as long-term results are still awaited, indications for using the method should be strict and only those patients should be so treated in whom operation would be associated with a high risk or who are inoperable.","['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Anesthesia, Local', 'Aneurysm, Ruptured', 'Cerebral Angiography', 'Embolization, Therapeutic', 'Evaluation Studies as Topic', 'Female', 'Fluoroscopy', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Intracranial Aneurysm', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Platinum', 'Subarachnoid Hemorrhage', 'Time Factors', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed']",7768161,"[['C23.550.291.125'], ['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['E03.155.086.231'], ['C14.907.055.185'], ['E01.370.350.578.937.180', 'E01.370.350.700.060.180', 'E01.370.350.700.560.180', 'E01.370.370.050.180', 'E01.370.376.537.750.180', 'E05.629.937.180'], ['E02.520.360', 'E02.926.500'], ['E05.337', 'N05.715.360.335'], ['E01.370.350.700.225'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.249', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.350', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.350'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C10.228.140.300.510.600', 'C14.907.055.635', 'C14.907.253.560.300'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['D01.268.556.690', 'D01.268.956.734', 'D01.552.544.690'], ['C10.228.140.300.535.800', 'C14.907.253.573.800', 'C23.550.414.913.850'], ['G01.910.857'], ['E01.370.350.350.810', 'E01.370.350.600.350.700.810', 'E01.370.350.700.700.810', 'E01.370.350.700.810.810', 'E01.370.350.825.810.810']]","['Diseases [C]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
Comparison between mainly mucosa-supported and combined mucosa-implant-supported mandibular overdentures.,"The purpose of this study is to compare mainly mucosa-supported and combined mucosa-implant-supported complete mandibular overdentures. Ten completely edentulous patients received 20 press-fit dental implants at the canine regions of the mandible. Each patient received 2 implants, which were left submerged and unloaded for 4 months. The patients were divided into 2 groups: group I patients received mandibular overdentures retained by a magnet attachment (mainly mucosa-supported overdenture). Group II patients received mandibular overdentures retained by a bar attachment (combined mucosa-implant-supported overdenture). The patients were evaluated clinically and radiographically immediately after overdenture delivery and after 6 months, 12 months, and 18 months. The results showed that the mainly mucosa-supported overdentures had less bone resorption distal to the implant in comparison to the combined mucosa-implant-supported overdentures. Plaque index score was significantly high in the group treated with magnet-retained overdentures. After 18 months follow up, the group treated with combined mucosa-implant-supported overdentures showed a significant increase in gingival inflammation when compared with the other group. The type of attachment or support may affect gingival inflammation or plaque accumulation. Increased functional load may affect bone density and resorption.","['Alveolar Bone Loss', 'Dental Implantation', 'Dental Implantation, Endosseous', 'Dental Plaque', 'Dental Prosthesis, Implant-Supported', 'Dental Restoration Failure', 'Dental Stress Analysis', 'Denture Design', 'Denture Retention', 'Denture, Overlay', 'Female', 'Gingivitis', 'Humans', 'Jaw, Edentulous', 'Magnetics', 'Male', 'Mandible', 'Middle Aged', 'Mouth Mucosa']",15592001,"[['C05.116.264.150', 'C07.465.714.354.500'], ['E04.545.550.280', 'E04.650.230', 'E06.645.550.280', 'E06.780.314'], ['E04.545.550.280.280', 'E04.650.230.500', 'E06.645.550.280.280', 'E06.780.314.310'], ['C07.793.208.377'], ['E06.780.346.706', 'E07.695.190.185'], ['E06.323.400', 'E06.780.346.725'], ['E06.308'], ['E06.780.346.760.300', 'E06.912.250'], ['E06.780.346.760.550'], ['E06.780.346.760.887', 'E07.695.190.200.215'], ['C01.408', 'C07.465.714.258.480'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C05.500.480', 'C07.320.550', 'C07.465.550.425', 'C07.793.597.425'], ['H01.671.493'], ['A02.835.232.781.324.502.632', 'A14.521.632'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['A10.615.550.599', 'A14.549.512']]","['Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Named Groups [M]']",1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0
Determination of the full-genome sequence of hepatitis E virus (HEV) SAAS-FX17 and use as a reference to identify putative HEV genotype 4 virulence determinants.,"BACKGROUND: Four major genotypes of hepatitis E virus (HEV), the causative agent of hepatitis E, have so far been recognized. While genotypes 3 and 4 are both zoonotic, the disease symptoms caused by the latter tend to be more severe. To examine if specific nucleotide/amino acid variations between genotypes 3 and 4 play a role in determining the severity of hepatitis E disease, the complete genome of one swine HEV genotype 4 isolate, SAAS-FX17, was determined and compared with other genotype 4 and genotype 3 genomes to identify putative HEV genotype 4 virulence determinants.RESULTS: A total of 42 conformable nt/aa variations between genotype 3 and 4 HEVs were detected, of which 19 were proposed to be potential disease severity determinants for genotype 4 strains.CONCLUSIONS: One potential determinant was located in each of the 5'-UTR and 3'-UTR, 3 and 12 within ORF1 and ORF2 respectively, and 2 in the junction region.","[""3' Untranslated Regions"", ""5' Untranslated Regions"", 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Genome, Viral', 'Genotype', 'Hepatitis E virus', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nucleic Acid Conformation', 'Open Reading Frames', 'Phylogeny', 'RNA, Viral', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Swine', 'Virulence']",23134633,"[['D13.444.735.544.875.880', 'D13.444.735.790.878.880', 'G05.360.340.024.220.880.880', 'G05.360.340.024.340.137.910.880'], ['D13.444.735.544.875.885', 'D13.444.735.790.878.885', 'G05.360.340.024.220.880.885', 'G05.360.340.024.340.137.910.885'], ['B01.050'], ['G02.111.570.080', 'G05.360.080', 'L01.453.245.667.080'], ['G05.360.340.358.840'], ['G05.380'], ['B04.450.412', 'B04.820.578.407.400'], ['L01.453.245.667'], ['G02.111.570.820.486', 'G05.360.580'], ['G05.360.335.760.640', 'G05.360.340.024.340.137.650'], ['G05.697', 'G16.075.605', 'L01.100.697'], ['D13.444.735.828'], ['E05.393.751'], ['E05.393.760.700'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.500.880'], ['G06.930']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
Chronic corticosterone administration dose-dependently modulates Abeta(1-42)- and NMDA-induced neurodegeneration in rat magnocellular nucleus basalis.,"The impact of glucocorticoids on beta-amyloid(1-42) (Abeta(1-42)) and NMDA-induced neurodegeneration was investigated in vivo. Abeta(1-42) or NMDA was injected into the cholinergic magnocellular nucleus basalis in adrenalectomized (ADX) rats, ADX rats supplemented with 25%, 100%, 2x100% corticosterone pellets, or sham-ADX controls. Abeta(1-42)- or NMDA-induced damage of cholinergic nucleus basalis neurones was assessed by quantitative acetylcholinesterase histochemistry. Plasma concentrations of corticosterone and cholinergic fibre loss after Abeta(1-42) or NMDA injection showed a clear U-shaped dose-response relationship. ADX and subsequent loss of serum corticosterone potentiated both the Abeta(1-42) and NMDA-induced neurodegeneration. ADX+25% corticosterone resulted in a 10-90 nM plasma corticosterone concentration, which significantly attenuated the Abeta(1-42) and NMDA neurotoxicity. ADX+100% corticosterone (corticosterone concentrations of 110-270 nM) potently decreased both Abeta(1-42)- and NMDA-induced neurotoxic brain damage. In contrast, high corticosterone concentrations of 310-650 nM potentiated Abeta(1-42)- and NMDA-triggered neurodegeneration. In conclusion, chronic low or high corticosterone concentrations increase the vulnerability of cholinergic cells to neurotoxic insult, while slightly elevated corticosterone levels protect against neurotoxic injury. Enhanced neurotoxicity of NMDA in the presence of high concentrations of specific glucocorticoid receptor agonists suggests that the corticosterone effects are mediated by glucocorticoid receptors.","['Amyloid beta-Peptides', 'Animals', 'Basal Nucleus of Meynert', 'Corticosterone', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Excitatory Amino Acid Agonists', 'Male', 'N-Methylaspartate', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neuroprotective Agents', 'Peptide Fragments', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar', 'Time Factors']",10844576,"[['D12.644.024', 'D12.776.049.407.249.500', 'D12.776.543.039.500'], ['B01.050'], ['A08.186.211.200.885.287.249.880.100'], ['D04.210.500.745.745.654.237', 'D06.472.040.585.353.237'], ['G07.690.773.875', 'G07.690.936.500'], ['D27.505.519.625.190.200', 'D27.505.696.577.190.200'], ['D12.125.067.500.400', 'D12.125.119.170.400'], ['C23.550.737'], ['D27.505.696.706.548', 'D27.505.954.427.575'], ['D12.644.541'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700.900'], ['G01.910.857']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Diseases [C]']",1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Time from symptom onset to treatment and outcomes after thrombolytic therapy. GUSTO-1 Investigators.,"OBJECTIVES: This study sought to examine the relations among patient characteristics, time to thrombolysis and outcomes in the international GUSTO-I trial.BACKGROUND: Studies have shown better left ventricular function and decreased infarct size as well as increased survival with earlier thrombolysis, but the relative benefits of various thrombolytic agents with earlier administration are uncertain.METHODS: We evaluated the relations of baseline characteristics to three prospectively defined time variables: symptom onset to treatment, symptom onset to hospital arrival (presentation delay) and hospital arrival to treatment (treatment delay). We also examined the relations of delays to clinical outcomes and to the relative 30-day mortality benefit with accelerated tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) versus streptokinase.RESULTS: Female, elderly, diabetic and hypertensive patients had longer delays at all stages. Previous infarction or bypass surgery was an additional risk factor for treatment delay. Early thrombolysis was associated with lower overall mortality rate (< 2 h, 5.5%; > 4 h, 9.0%), but no additional relative benefit resulted from earlier treatment with accelerated t-PA versus streptokinase (p = 0.38). Longer presentation and treatment delays were both associated with increased mortality rate (presentation delay < 1 h, 5.6% and > 4 h, 8.6%; treatment delay < 1 h, 5.4%, and > 90 min, 8.1%). As time to treatment increased, the incidence of recurrent ischemia or reinfarction decreased, but the rates of shock, heart failure and stroke increased.CONCLUSIONS: Earlier treatment resulted in better outcomes, regardless of thrombolytic strategy. Elderly, female and diabetic patients were treated later, adding to their already substantial risk.","['Aged', 'Female', 'Fibrinolytic Agents', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Plasminogen Activators', 'Streptokinase', 'Thrombolytic Therapy', 'Time Factors', 'Tissue Plasminogen Activator', 'Treatment Outcome']",8636549,"[['M01.060.116.100'], ['D27.505.519.421.750', 'D27.505.954.411.320', 'D27.505.954.502.427'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['C14.280.647.500', 'C14.907.585.500', 'C23.550.513.355.750', 'C23.550.717.489.750'], ['D08.811.277.656.300.760.635', 'D08.811.277.656.959.350.635', 'D12.776.124.125.662'], ['D08.811.277.656.300.775', 'D12.776.124.125.662.537'], ['E02.319.913'], ['G01.910.857'], ['D08.811.277.656.300.760.875', 'D08.811.277.656.959.350.875', 'D12.776.124.125.662.768', 'D23.119.970'], ['E01.789.800', 'N04.761.559.590.800', 'N05.715.360.575.575.800']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Health Care [N]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
The effects of oxcarbazepine and valproate therapies on growth in children with epilepsy.,"AIM: This study aimed to evaluate the effects of monotherapy with valproate or oxcarbazepine on the linear growth of children with idiopathic epilepsy.METHODS: Antiepileptic treatment with valproate or oxcarbazepine was initiated in 76 patients. These were evaluated at baseline and at 6 and 18 months after commencement of therapy to determine height standard deviations (height z-scores). Serum ghrelin, insulin-like growth factor-1, and insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-3 levels were measured.RESULTS: In prepubertal patients receiving oxcarbazepine, height z-scores were elevated after 6 and 18 months of therapy (p = 0.008 and p = 0.001, respectively); in pubertal patients, a significant increase was noted at the 18th month of therapy (p = 0.004). In prepubertal patients receiving oxcarbazepine, serum standardized insulin-like growth factor-1 and insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-3 levels were significantly higher at the 18th month of therapy compared with baseline (p = 0.005 and p = 0.004, respectively). In puber-tal patients receiving valproate, serum ghrelin levels were significantly decreased at the 18th month of therapy compared with baseline (p = 0.006).CONCLUSION: Exposure to oxcarbazepine stimulated linear growth in epileptic patients through mechanisms involving the release of insulin-like growth factor-1 and insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-3. In contrast, expo-sure to valproate did not affect linear growth, but did lead to a decrease in serum ghrelin levels.","['Adolescent', 'Anticonvulsants', 'Body Height', 'Carbamazepine', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Epilepsy', 'Female', 'Ghrelin', 'Humans', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor Binding Protein 3', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor I', 'Male', 'Oxcarbazepine', 'Puberty', 'Valproic Acid']",22630163,"[['M01.060.057'], ['D27.505.954.427.080'], ['E01.370.600.115.100.160.100', 'E05.041.124.160.500', 'G07.100.100.160.100', 'G07.345.249.314.100'], ['D03.633.300.240.127'], ['M01.060.406'], ['M01.060.406.448'], ['C10.228.140.490'], ['D06.472.699.301', 'D12.644.548.322'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D12.776.157.420.270'], ['D12.644.276.937.400', 'D12.776.124.862.400', 'D12.776.467.937.400', 'D23.529.937.400'], ['D03.633.300.240.127.500'], ['G08.686.760', 'G08.686.841.374'], ['D02.241.081.944.509.900', 'D10.251.400.895.593.900']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
HHV-6-DNAemia related to CMV-DNAemia after liver transplantation.,"In addition to cytomegalovirus (CMV), activation of other betaherpesviruses, especially human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6), has been reported in liver transplant patients. The purpose of this study was to investigate the posttransplant HHV-6-DNAemia in relation to CMV-DNAemia in liver transplant patients. Thirty-one adult liver allograft recipients were regularly monitored for CMV and HHV-6 during the first 3 months after transplantation. For the diagnosis of CMV infections, pp65-antigenemia assay and quantitative DNA-PCR were used. HHV-6 was demonstrated by using quantitative DNA-PCR and HHV-6 antigenemia test. Altogether 253 blood specimens of 31 recipients were analyzed. In addition, CMV and HHV-6 specific antigens were demonstrated by immunohistochemistry in liver biopsy specimens in the case of graft dysfunction. Thirteen patients (40%) developed a clinically significant CMV infection, at a mean of 33 days (range 5 to 62 days) after transplantation and were treated with intravenous ganciclovir. The peak viral loads of these symptomatic CMV infections were high (CMV-DNA 34210 +/- 37557 copies/mL plasma). Six additional asymptomatic patients demonstrated significantly lower CMV-DNAemia levels (1020 +/- 1008 copies/mL, P < .05), and were not treated. Concurrently with CMV, HHV-6 DNAemia and antigenemia were detected in 17 of 19 patients, mean 11 days (range 6 to 24 days) after transplantation. HHV-6 appeared prior to CMV in most cases (12 of 17). However, the peak viral loads were low (HHV-6-DNA <1500 copies/mL blood), even in the five patients who demonstrated HHV-6 antigens on liver biopsy. All CMV infections were successfully treated with ganciclovir and the CMV DNAemia/antigenemia subsided. HHV-6 also responded to the antiviral treatment, but more slowly and less clearly. In conclusion, HHV-6 activations were common and usually associated with CMV infection in liver transplant patients. Further investigation of the clinical significance of HHV-6 DNAemia/antigenemia is necessary.","['Adult', 'Cytomegalovirus', 'Cytomegalovirus Infections', 'DNA, Viral', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Herpesvirus 6, Human', 'Humans', 'Liver Transplantation', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Postoperative Complications', 'Postoperative Period', 'Roseolovirus Infections', 'Time Factors', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",15848678,"[['M01.060.116'], ['B04.280.382.150.150'], ['C01.925.256.466.245'], ['D13.444.308.568'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.249', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.350', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.350'], ['B04.280.382.150.750.400'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E02.095.147.725.490', 'E04.210.650', 'E04.936.450.490', 'E04.936.580.490'], ['E05.393.620.500'], ['C23.550.767'], ['E04.614.750', 'N02.421.585.753.750'], ['C01.925.256.466.850'], ['G01.910.857'], ['E04.936.864']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
Abnormal responses to ingested substances in murine systemic lupus erythematosus: apparent effect of a casein-free diet on the development of systemic lupus erythematosus in NZB/W mice.,"To assess the development of oral tolerance to casein in NZB/W female mice, they must be bred and raised on a casein free diet. We examined the specific immune responses of the mice to the long term experimental feeding of casein. Twelve of fifteen casein free mice were still alive at 10 months of age, although by this age only 1/10 mice eating the normal diet was still alive. The casein free mice had markedly less anti-DNA antibody, their IgM to IgG antinative DNA switch was delayed and deposits of immunoreactants in the glomeruli were greatly decreased. The reason for this apparent effect of the removal of casein from the diet is unknown; however, immunostimulatory and endorphin-like regions have recently been reported in casein.","['Animals', 'Antibodies, Antinuclear', 'Caseins', 'DNA', 'Female', 'Food Hypersensitivity', 'Lupus Erythematosus, Systemic', 'Lupus Nephritis', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NZB']",3497268,"[['B01.050'], ['D12.776.124.486.485.114.323.204', 'D12.776.124.790.651.114.323.204', 'D12.776.377.715.548.114.323.204'], ['D12.776.256.159.750.207', 'D12.776.744.150'], ['D13.444.308'], ['C20.543.480.370'], ['C17.300.480', 'C20.111.590'], ['C12.777.419.570.363.680', 'C13.351.968.419.570.363.680', 'C17.300.480.680', 'C20.111.590.560'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500'], ['B01.050.050.199.520.520.580', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500.400.580']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Diseases [C]']",0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Polymorphisms at IL28B gene as predictors of viral relapse in genotype 4 Egyptian hepatitis C patients.,"Chronic HCV is one of the commonest causes of chronic liver disease worldwide with about 15% of population infected in Egypt. Certain single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) lying near the IL28B gene were found to affect the spontaneous clearance as well as treatment outcome of HCV. To examine the association between different IL28B variants and the relapse of HCV infection after combined therapy with ribavirin and pegylated interferon (pegIFN). Hundered HCV genotype four patients received 1.5 mg/kg/week peginterferon alfa-2b plus 800-1400 mg/d ribavirin (weight-adjusted) for 48 weeks. IL28B polymorphisms (rs12980275, rs12979860, and 1 rs8099917) were studied in responders and relapsers at week 72. Out of 69 patients receiving treatment, 13 (18.8%) were relapsers. By stratifying patients on the basis of the IL-28/60 genotype (CC vs. CT/TT), CC patients showed lower relapse rates (2.3%) compared with CT/TT patients (46.2%) (P < 0.001). On the basis of the IL-28/75 genotype (GG vs. GA/AA), the GG patients achieved higher relapse rates (62.5%) compared with GA/AA patients (13.1%) (P = 0.004). Moreover, no statistical significant difference was observed between the TT patients compared with GG/GT patients on the basis of the IL-28/17 genotype. SNPs at IL-28/60 and IL-28/75 are possible predictors of relapse in patients receiving dual treatment.","['Adult', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Egypt', 'Female', 'Genotype', 'Hepacivirus', 'Hepatitis C, Chronic', 'Humans', 'Interferon alpha-2', 'Interferon-alpha', 'Interferons', 'Interleukins', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Polyethylene Glycols', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Recurrence', 'Ribavirin', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",26280154,"[['M01.060.116'], ['D27.505.954.122.388'], ['E05.318.372.500.875', 'N05.715.360.330.500.875', 'N06.850.520.450.500.875'], ['E02.319.310'], ['Z01.058.266.317'], ['G05.380'], ['B04.450.380', 'B04.820.578.344.475'], ['C01.221.250.750.120', 'C01.925.440.440.120', 'C01.925.782.350.350.120', 'C06.552.380.350.120', 'C06.552.380.705.440.120'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D12.644.276.374.440.890.250.500', 'D12.776.467.374.440.890.250.500', 'D23.529.374.440.890.250.500'], ['D12.644.276.374.440.890.250', 'D12.776.467.374.440.890.250', 'D23.529.374.440.890.250'], ['D12.644.276.374.440', 'D12.776.467.374.440', 'D23.529.374.440'], ['D12.644.276.374.465', 'D12.776.467.374.465', 'D23.529.374.465'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['D02.033.455.250.700', 'D05.750.741', 'D25.720.741', 'J01.637.051.720.741'], ['G05.365.795.598'], ['D12.776.828'], ['C23.550.291.937'], ['D13.570.800.790'], ['E01.789.800', 'N04.761.559.590.800', 'N05.715.360.575.575.800'], ['M01.060.116.815']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,1
Factors associated with stigma among caregivers of patients with bipolar disorder in the STEP-BD study.,"OBJECTIVE: Little is known about the factors contributing to mental illness stigma among caregivers of people with bipolar disorder.METHODS: A total of 500 caregivers of patients participating in the Systematic Treatment Enhancement Program for Bipolar Disorder (STEP-BD) study were interviewed in a cross-sectional design on measures of stigma, mood, burden, and coping. Relatives and friends with bipolar disorder were assessed on measures of diagnosis and clinical status, determined by a days-well measure derived from psychiatrist ratings of DSM-IV episode status. Because patients' clinical status varied widely, separate models were run for patients who were euthymic for at least three-fourths of the past year (well group) and for those who met criteria for an affective episode for at least one-fourth of the previous year (unwell group). Stepwise multiple regression was used to identify patient, illness, and caregiver characteristics associated with caregiver stigma.RESULTS: In the unwell group, greater mental illness stigma was associated with bipolar I (versus II) disorder, less social support for the caregiver, fewer caregiver social interactions, and being a caregiver of Hispanic descent. In the well group, greater stigma was associated with being a caregiver who is the adult child of a parent with bipolar disorder, who has a college education, who has fewer social interactions, and who cares for a female bipolar patient.CONCLUSIONS: Mental illness stigma was found to be prevalent among caregivers of persons with bipolar disorder who have active symptoms as well as for caregivers of those who have remitted symptoms. Stigma is typically associated with factors identifying patients as ""different"" during symptomatic periods. Research is needed to understand how the stigma experienced by caregivers during stable phases of illness differs from the stigma experienced during patients' illness states.","['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Caregivers', 'Cost of Illness', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Depression', 'Female', 'Health Promotion', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Psychology', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Social Support', 'Stereotyping']",17215411,"[['M01.060.057'], ['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['F03.084.500'], ['M01.085', 'M01.526.485.200', 'N02.360.200'], ['N03.219.151.165', 'N05.715.360.300.800.438.375.182', 'N06.850.520.308.980.438.475.046'], ['E05.318.372.500.875', 'N05.715.360.330.500.875', 'N06.850.520.450.500.875'], ['F01.145.126.350'], ['I02.233.332.445', 'N02.421.726.407.579'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['F04.096.628'], ['E05.318.308.980.438.475.456.500', 'N05.715.360.300.800.438.375.364.500', 'N06.850.520.308.980.438.475.364.500'], ['I01.880.853.500.600'], ['F01.100.920', 'F01.145.813.854']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Organisms [B]']",0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0
"Familial risks for nerve, nerve root and plexus disorders in siblings based on hospitalisations in Sweden.","BACKGROUND: Nerve, nerve root and plexus disorders are common diseases, but little is known about familial clustering in these diseases. This is, to our knowledge, the first systematic family study carried out on these diseases.METHODS: Familial risks for siblings who were hospitalised for nerve, nerve root and plexus disorders in Sweden were defined. A nationwide database for neurological diseases was constructed by linking the Multigeneration Register on 0-69-year-old siblings to the Hospital Discharge Register covering the years 1987-2001. Standardised risk ratios (SIRs) were calculated for affected sibling pairs by comparing them with those whose siblings had no neurological disease.RESULTS: 29,686 patients, 43% men and 57% women, were diagnosed at a mean age of 37.5 years. 191 siblings were hospitalised for these disorders, giving an overall SIR of 2.59 (95% CI 1.58 to 4.22), with no sex difference. Plantar nerve mononeuritis and carpal tunnel syndrome showed the highest familial risks: 4.82 (1.08 to 16.04) and 4.08 (2.07 to 7.84), respectively. Lateral poplitean and plantar nerve neuritis preferentially affected women, with SIRs of >8; disorders of the other cranial nerves affected only men, with an SIR of >10. Concordant trigeminal neuralgia, Bell's palsy and carpal tunnel syndrome showed familial risks, but, with the exception of Bell's palsy, they also showed correlation between spouses, implying environmental sharing of risk factors.CONCLUSIONS: The results cannot distinguish between inheritable or shared environmental factors, or their interactions, but they clearly show familial clustering, suggestive of multifactorial aetiology and inviting for aetiological research.","['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'Cranial Nerve Diseases', 'Female', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Hospitalization', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Peripheral Nervous System Diseases', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Siblings', 'Sweden']",17183020,"[['M01.060.057'], ['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['M01.060.406'], ['M01.060.406.448'], ['E05.318.372.500.750', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750'], ['C10.292'], ['C23.550.291.687.500', 'G05.380.355'], ['E02.760.400', 'N02.421.585.400'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.703'], ['M01.060.703.520'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['C10.668.829'], ['E05.318.740.600.800.715', 'N04.452.871.715', 'N05.715.360.750.625.700.690', 'N06.850.505.715', 'N06.850.520.830.600.800.715'], ['E05.318.740.600.800.725', 'N05.715.350.200.700', 'N05.715.360.750.625.700.700', 'N06.850.490.625.750', 'N06.850.520.830.600.800.725'], ['F01.829.263.500.490', 'I01.880.853.150.500.505', 'M01.781'], ['Z01.542.816.500']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Geographicals [Z]']",0,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1
Investigation into the lignin decomposition mechanism by analysis of the pyrolysis product of Pinus radiata.,"Lignin pyrolysis chemistry was investigated via the analysis of the products obtained from the fast pyrolysis of a pine wood at different temperatures. Methoxy phenols, such as guaiacols and eugenols, were produced mainly at 375 and 475°C, while non-methoxy phenols, such as alkyl phenols and pyrocatechols were dominant at 525 and 575°C. At 575°C, aromatic hydrocarbons were formed together with larger amounts of light hydrocarbon gases. When the temperature was increased from 375 and 475°C, the yield of pyrolytic lignin was increased, whereas its average molecular weight was decreased. At 525°C, smaller molecular pyrolytic lignin with a maximum concentration of phenolic hydroxyl groups was produced due to the increased secondary cracking of the reaction intermediates. On the other hand, at 575°C, larger molecular pyrolytic lignin with smaller amounts of phenolic hydroxyl groups was produced due to the increased condensation activity of the pyrolysis reaction intermediates.","['Hot Temperature', 'Lignin', 'Phenols', 'Pinus', 'Wood']",27501034,"[['G01.906.595.543', 'G16.500.275.063.725.710.380', 'G16.500.750.775.710.380', 'N06.230.300.100.725.232', 'N06.230.300.100.725.710.380'], ['D05.750.078.562.180.515', 'D05.750.078.687', 'D20.538', 'D25.720.099.687', 'J01.637.051.720.099.687'], ['D02.455.426.559.389.657'], ['B01.650.940.800.575.912.625.875.777'], ['A18.450.500.500', 'J01.637.241.900']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0
Computing with synthetic protocells.,"In this article we present a new kind of computing device that uses biochemical reactions networks as building blocks to implement logic gates. The architecture of a computing machine relies on these generic and composable building blocks, computation units, that can be used in multiple instances to perform complex boolean functions. Standard logical operations are implemented by biochemical networks, encapsulated and insulated within synthetic vesicles called protocells. These protocells are capable of exchanging energy and information with each other through transmembrane electron transfer. In the paradigm of computation we propose, protoputing, a machine can solve only one problem and therefore has to be built specifically. Thus, the programming phase in the standard computing paradigm is represented in our approach by the set of assembly instructions (specific attachments) that directs the wiring of the protocells that constitute the machine itself. To demonstrate the computing power of protocellular machines, we apply it to solve a NP-complete problem, known to be very demanding in computing power, the 3-SAT problem. We show how to program the assembly of a machine that can verify the satisfiability of a given boolean formula. Then we show how to use the massive parallelism of these machines to verify in less than 20 min all the valuations of the input variables and output a fluorescent signal when the formula is satisfiable or no signal at all otherwise.","['Algorithms', 'Artificial Cells', 'Computer Simulation', 'Electrons', 'Enzymes', 'Oxidative Phosphorylation', 'Photosynthesis', 'Synthetic Biology', 'Thermodynamics']",25969126,"[['G17.035', 'L01.224.050'], ['J01.637.051.479.258', 'J01.637.087.500.254'], ['L01.224.160'], ['G01.249.335', 'G01.358.500.750'], ['D08.811'], ['G02.111.665.550', 'G03.295.631', 'G03.796.550'], ['G02.111.158.937', 'G02.111.669.700', 'G02.740.921', 'G03.191.937', 'G03.493.700', 'G03.800.700', 'G15.568'], ['H01.158.273.904', 'J01.293.069.500'], ['G01.906']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]']",0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0
The contribution of cyclooxygenase-1 and -2 to persistent thromboxane biosynthesis in aspirin-treated essential thrombocythemia: implications for antiplatelet therapy.,"We tested whether cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) expression and unacetylated COX-1 in newly formed platelets might contribute to persistent thromboxane (TX) biosynthesis in aspirin-treated essential thrombocythemia (ET). Forty-one patients on chronic aspirin (100 mg/day) and 24 healthy subjects were studied. Platelet COX-2 expression was significantly increased in patients and correlated with thiazole orange-positive platelets (r = 0.71, P < .001). The rate of TXA(2) biosynthesis in vivo, as reflected by urinary 11-dehydro-TXB(2) (TXM) excretion, and the maximal biosynthetic capacity of platelets, as reflected by serum TXB(2), were higher in patients compared with aspirin-treated healthy volunteers. Serum TXB(2) was significantly reduced by the selective COX-2 inhibitor NS-398 added in vitro. Patients were randomized to adding the selective COX-2 inhibitor, etoricoxib, or continuing aspirin for 7 days. Etoricoxib significantly reduced by approximately 25% TXM excretion and serum TXB(2). Fourteen of the 41 patients were studied again 21 (+/- 7) months after the first visit. Serum TXB(2) was consistently reduced by approximately 30% by adding NS398 in vitro, while it was completely suppressed with 50 microM aspirin. Accelerated platelet regeneration in most aspirin-treated ET patients may explain aspirin-persistent TXA(2) biosynthesis through enhanced COX-2 activity and faster renewal of unacetylated COX-1. These findings may help in reassessing the optimal antiplatelet strategy in ET.","['Adult', 'Aspirin', 'Cyclooxygenase 1', 'Cyclooxygenase 2', 'Cyclooxygenase Inhibitors', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Etoricoxib', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors', 'Pyridines', 'Sulfones', 'Thrombocythemia, Essential', 'Thromboxane A2', 'Thromboxane B2', 'Thromboxanes', 'Treatment Outcome']",19887674,"[['M01.060.116'], ['D02.455.426.559.389.657.410.595.176'], ['D08.811.600.720.500'], ['D08.811.600.720.750'], ['D27.505.519.389.310', 'D27.505.696.663.850.014.040.500.500', 'D27.505.954.158.030.500', 'D27.505.954.329.030.500'], ['E02.319.310'], ['D02.886.590.444', 'D03.383.725.354'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E01.370.225.500.607.512', 'E01.370.225.750.551.512', 'E05.200.500.607.512', 'E05.200.750.551.512', 'E05.478.583', 'H01.158.100.656.234.512', 'H01.158.201.344.512', 'H01.158.201.486.512', 'H01.181.122.573.512', 'H01.181.122.605.512'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['D27.505.954.502.780'], ['D03.383.725'], ['D02.886.590'], ['C15.378.100.832', 'C15.378.140.860.800', 'C15.378.190.636.860.800', 'C15.378.463.825'], ['D10.251.355.255.100.825.800', 'D10.251.355.310.166.971.800'], ['D10.251.355.255.100.825.810', 'D10.251.355.310.166.971.810'], ['D10.251.355.255.100.825', 'D10.251.355.310.166.971'], ['E01.789.800', 'N04.761.559.590.800', 'N05.715.360.575.575.800']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Health Care [N]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0

Effect of prolonged intermittent thyrotropin-releasing hormone administration to fetal and neonatal rats.,"Fetal and neonatal rats received daily subcutaneous injections of 10 microgram thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) until 7 or 14 days postnatally. At 70 days the pups were challenged with 1 microgram TRH intravenously via an indwelling jugular cannula. Basal serum thyroxine, triiodothyronine, and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) concentrations did not differ among the three groups. The mean TSH responses as determined by the mean peak TSH concentration and the total TSH response as determined by planimetry were not significantly different, and there was no significant difference in pituitary TSH content following the TRH challenge among the three groups.

[An attempt to use ofloxacin in patients with mucoviscidosis].,"The literature data and the data of the authors on the pathogenesis and pathogenetic and etiotropic therapy of mucoviscidosis are presented. The use of ofloxacin as an antibacterial agent in the complex treatment of mucoviscidosis is considered expedient. The drug was administered intravenously in a dose of 400 mg twice a day for 5 days followed by the oral use of the drug in the form of tablets according to the same scheme. The microbiological investigation of the sputum specimens revealed diagnostically significant titers of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus and Klebsiella spp. The isolates except for one case (Ps.aeruginosa) were susceptible to ofloxacin. The treatment with ofloxacin in accordance with the above scheme resulted in a rapid improvement of the patient state: the intoxication lowered, the expectoration and the sputum viscosity decreased, the body temperature normalized by the 5th day. The drug tolerance after the intravenous and enteral administration was good. The intravenous injections of ofloxacin induced a 1.5-fold increase in the intensity of the neutrophil oxygen burst.

Therefore, the activities of xenobiotic metabolic enzymes such as phase I and II were examined in lung as well as liver tissues (to compare the effects between target and non-target organs). Besides, the activities/levels of tissue marker enzymes, antioxidants, lipid peroxidation (LPO), cytochrome P450 1A1 (CYP1A1) expressions and histological observation of lungs were also analyzed. B(a)P (50 mg/kg body weight) was administered to male Swiss albino mice (20-25 g) to experimentally induce lung cancer.

Histological examination of lungs revealed severe alveolar and bronchiolar damages in B(a)P-induced mice. Immunohistochemical and western blot analysis of CYP1A1 increased significantly in lung tissues of B(a)P-induced animals.

The main reason for failure in both groups was partial fracture or total loss of the inlays. Secondary caries was found to be associated with three inlays in one high caries risk patient. One inlay was replaced because of postoperative sensitivity.CONCLUSION: A relatively high and increasing failure rate was observed over the 6-year period of the study. The failure rate was more pronounced in the GIC group.","['Adult', 'Aged', 'Composite Resins', 'Dental Porcelain', 'Dental Restoration Failure', 'Female', 'Glass Ionomer Cements', 'Humans', 'Inlays', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Outcome Assessment, Health Care', 'Resin Cements']",9594473,"[['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['D05.750.716.822.308', 'D25.339.816.500', 'D25.720.716.822.308', 'J01.637.051.339.816.500', 'J01.637.051.720.716.822.308'], ['D25.339.376', 'J01.637.051.339.376', 'J01.637.153.377'], ['E06.323.400', 'E06.780.346.725'], ['D25.339.291.402', 'J01.637.051.339.291.402'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E06.323.428.275', 'E06.780.346.737.500', 'E07.695.190.190.350'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['H01.770.644.145.431', 'N04.761.559.590', 'N05.715.360.575.575'], ['D05.750.716.822.730', 'D25.339.291.750', 'D25.720.716.822.730', 'J01.637.051.339.291.750', 'J01.637.051.720.716.822.730']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]', 'Health Care [N]']",0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,0

"Use of a First Large-Sized Coil Versus Conventional Coils for Embolization of Cerebral Aneurysms: Effects on Packing Density, Coil Length, and Durable Occlusion.","OBJECTIVE: To investigate effects of using a large-sized coil first on embolizing cerebral aneurysms compared with conventional coils.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-six patients with 51 saccular intracranial aneurysms who underwent embolization with a large-sized coil first were enrolled as the large-sized coil group. There were 33 female and 13 male patients with a mean age of 56.9 ± 8.8 years. The treatment modality was coiling alone in 30 aneurysms and stent-assisted coiling in 21. Meanwhile, 50 patients with 53 intracranial aneurysms who were treated with conventional-sized coils were selected as the control conventional-sized coil group, including 36 female and 14 male patients with a mean age of 54.6 ± 5.8 years. The treatment modality was coiling alone in 29 aneurysms and stent-assisted coiling in 24 aneurysms. The occlusion rate, percent packing volume, total coil number and length, and follow-up occlusion rate were compared between the 2 groups.RESULTS: Significantly (P < 0.001) decreased percent packing volume (19.54% ± 6.44% vs. 27.39% ± 5.68%), decreased coil number (2.98 ± 1.09 vs. 6.38 ± 1.65), and length (26.20 ± 26.57 vs. 44.35 ± 35.88 cm) were achieved in the large versus the conventional coil group. At angiographic follow-up of 8 months, only 1 aneurysm (2.2%) recurred in the large coil group compared with 5 aneurysms recurrent (11.1%) in the conventional coil group.CONCLUSIONS: The use of a large-sized coil as the first one for embolizing cerebral aneurysms may be a better embolization strategy because it achieves similar initial occlusion rates, decreased packing density, decreased coil numbers and lengths, and reduced recurrence prevalence at follow-up.","['Aged', 'China', 'Cohort Studies', 'Embolization, Therapeutic', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Intracranial Aneurysm', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Treatment Outcome']",30946999,"[['M01.060.116.100'], ['Z01.252.474.164'], ['E05.318.372.500.750', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750'], ['E02.520.360', 'E02.926.500'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.249', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.350', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.350'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C10.228.140.300.510.600', 'C14.907.055.635', 'C14.907.253.560.300'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['E01.789.800', 'N04.761.559.590.800', 'N05.715.360.575.575.800']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]']",0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1

Inverse laminoplasty for the treatment of lumbar spinal stenosis.,"STUDY DESIGN: Fifteen patients with lumbar spinal stenosis were treated by a new technique, inverse laminoplasty, and the results were evaluated clinically and radiologically.OBJECTIVE: To present the advantages of inverse laminoplasty over laminectomy for the treatment of lumbar spinal stenosis.SUMMARY AND BACKGROUND DATA: Laminectomy has been used widely in the treatment of lumbar spinal stenosis. Destruction of the spinal bony structure, instability, and peridural scar formation are the main problems with this procedure. To overcome these disadvantages, a practical technique is presented here.MATERIAL AND METHODS: In a prospective study, 15 patients who underwent surgery with the inverse laminoplasty technique were evaluated clinically and radiologically. The Oswestry Disability Index was used for clinical assessment. L4-L5 spinal stenosis was detected in all patients. As the operative technique, the L4 lamina was elevated en bloc using a high-speed drill and rongeur. After removal of the ligamentum flavum, the roof of the foramina, and/or disc, the lamina was rotated 180 degrees, rested on facets, and reattached by use of a titanium miniplate.RESULTS: All patients improved clinically and neurologically after this procedure. The mean Oswestry Disability Score was 38.33 preoperatively and 7.0 postoperatively. The mean follow-up time was 17.3 months. Spinal canal diameters were calculated by preoperative and postoperative computed tomography, and the mean enlargement was 77.8%. No complications were observed.CONCLUSION: With this technique, the important integrity of the spinal osseous structures is preserved, and a significant enlargement of the spinal canal area is achieved. This technique prevents peridural scar formation after laminectomy caused by a mechanical barrier effect. Long-term follow-up is needed to evaluate spinal stability in these patients.","['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Bone Plates', 'Disability Evaluation', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Laminectomy', 'Lumbar Vertebrae', 'Lumbosacral Region', 'Male', 'Medical Illustration', 'Middle Aged', 'Neurosurgical Procedures', 'Orthopedic Procedures', 'Prospective Studies', 'Spinal Canal', 'Spinal Stenosis', 'Titanium', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed', 'Treatment Outcome']",12131752,"[['M01.060.057'], ['M01.060.116'], ['E07.695.370.374', 'E07.858.442.660.460.374', 'E07.858.690.725.460.374'], ['E01.370.400'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.249', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.350', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.350'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E02.718.563', 'E04.188.400', 'E04.525.450', 'E04.555.350'], ['A02.835.232.834.519'], ['A01.923.176.519'], ['H02.385', 'J01.897.280.500.480', 'K01.093.410', 'L01.178.820.090.480'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['E04.525'], ['E02.718', 'E04.555'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.625', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.650', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.650'], ['A02.835.232.834.803'], ['C05.116.900.825'], ['D01.268.557.800', 'D01.268.956.878', 'D01.552.547.800'], ['E01.370.350.350.810', 'E01.370.350.600.350.700.810', 'E01.370.350.700.700.810', 'E01.370.350.700.810.810', 'E01.370.350.825.810.810'], ['E01.789.800', 'N04.761.559.590.800', 'N05.715.360.575.575.800']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]', 'Humanities [K]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,0
Gastric dilatation-volvulus in the dog with histological evidence of preexisting inflammatory bowel disease: a retrospective study of 23 cases.,"The gastric dilatation-volvulus (GDV) syndrome in the dog is considered to be multifactorial. The medical records of 42 dogs treated for GDV between 1990 and 1994 were reviewed in an effort to evaluate the correlation between GDV and preexisting gastrointestinal disease. Twenty-three cases fit the inclusion criteria of an intestinal biopsy taken at the time of corrective surgery and a complete medical history. The microscopic jejunal changes expected from the acute vascular compromise in these animals were diffuse edema, dilatation of lymphatics with possible lymphangiectasia, mucosal degeneration, diapedesis of neutrophils, and rare hemorrhage. These changes were discounted. Of the 23 biopsies, 14 (61%) were consistent with the presence of an underlying inflammatory disease, and of these 14, 12 (86%) were accompanied by case histories of prior gastrointestinal disturbances. This study raises the possibility of an association between GDV and inflammatory bowel disease.","['Animals', 'Biopsy', 'Dog Diseases', 'Dogs', 'Edema', 'Female', 'Gastric Dilatation', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Intestinal Obstruction', 'Jejunum', 'Male', 'Neutrophils', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Syndrome']",8784718,"[['B01.050'], ['E01.370.225.500.384.100', 'E01.370.225.998.054', 'E01.370.388.100', 'E04.074', 'E05.200.500.384.100', 'E05.200.998.054', 'E05.242.384.100'], ['C22.268'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.750.250.216.200'], ['C23.888.277'], ['C06.405.748.300'], ['C06.405.205.731', 'C06.405.469.432'], ['C06.405.469.531'], ['A03.556.124.684.500', 'A03.556.249.750'], ['A11.118.637.415.583', 'A11.627.340.583', 'A11.733.689', 'A15.145.229.637.415.583', 'A15.382.490.315.583', 'A15.382.680.689'], ['E05.318.372.500.500.500', 'E05.318.372.500.750.750', 'N05.715.360.330.500.500.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.825', 'N06.850.520.450.500.500.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.825'], ['C23.550.288.500']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Health Care [N]']",1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
Basal local cerebral glucose utilization is not altered after behavioral sensitization to quinpirole.,"Sensitization to psychostimulants results in a behavioral response of a greater magnitude than that produced by a given single dose. Previously, we have shown that sensitization to the D(2)/D(3) dopamine receptor agonist quinpirole produces alterations in quinpirole-stimulated local cerebral glucose utilization (LCGU) in ventral striatal and limbic cortical regions. To determine whether basal neuronal activity is altered in the sensitized animal, this study examined the effects of a sensitizing course of quinpirole on basal neuronal activity using the [(14)C]-2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) method in rats with verified sensitization. Adult, male Long-Evans rats (n = 7 or 10/group) were subjected to 10 injections of quinpirole (0.5 mg/kg, s.c.) or saline administered every 3rd day. Sensitization was verified on the basis of locomotor activity. The 2-DG procedure was performed in freely moving rats 3 days after the last quinpirole injection. LCGU was determined by quantitative autoradiography. No alterations in basal LCGU were detected in quinpirole-sensitized rats compared to those treated with saline. The present finding suggests that either the basal activity of very discrete populations of neurons is affected by sensitization to quinpirole that are not likely to be detected by the 2-DG method, or that the neurobiological changes that result in the sensitized behavioral response affect only stimulated, but not basal, neuronal activity.","['Animals', 'Autoradiography', 'Behavior, Animal', 'Binding, Competitive', 'Central Nervous System Stimulants', 'Cerebral Cortex', 'Deoxyglucose', 'Dopamine', 'Dopamine Agonists', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Glucose', 'Male', 'Motor Activity', 'Neurons', 'Quinpirole', 'Rats', 'Rats, Long-Evans', 'Receptors, Dopamine D2', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",17997222,"[['B01.050'], ['E01.370.225.750.132', 'E05.200.750.132', 'E05.799.256'], ['F01.145.113'], ['E05.196.080', 'G02.111.084', 'G02.111.570.120.309'], ['D27.505.696.282', 'D27.505.954.427.220'], ['A08.186.211.200.885.287.500'], ['D09.254.229'], ['D02.092.211.215.406', 'D02.092.311.342', 'D02.455.426.559.389.657.166.175.342'], ['D27.505.519.625.150.151', 'D27.505.696.577.150.151'], ['G03.295'], ['D09.947.875.359.448'], ['F01.145.632', 'G11.427.410.698'], ['A08.675', 'A11.671'], ['D03.633.100.810.842', 'D03.633.300.802'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700.500'], ['D12.776.543.750.670.300.400.500', 'D12.776.543.750.695.150.400.500', 'D12.776.543.750.720.330.400.500'], ['E05.318.370.800', 'E05.318.740.872', 'G17.800', 'N05.715.360.325.700', 'N05.715.360.750.725', 'N06.850.520.445.800', 'N06.850.520.830.872']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Health Care [N]']",1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

Effects of nitric oxide on detrusor relaxation.,"PURPOSE: Recently we (1994) reported the photo-induced adequate nitric oxide (PIANO) system, in which an NO- or NO2-carrying molecule which has been photoactivated to release NO, could be exploited to investigate the role of NO in various smooth muscle functions. This study was designed to characterize the effect of nitric oxide (NO) exploiting PIANO on rat detrusor relaxation by isometric tension recording and measuring changes in cGMP content.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Exposure to ultraviolet light was used (1 to 60 seconds) to evoke PIANO in the presence of streptozotocin, an NO-carrier, and N omega-nitro-L-arginine (L-NOARG), an NO2-carrier. During relaxation the cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) content was measured by radioimmunoassay.RESULTS: Rat detrusor strips were reversibly relaxed upon NO generation via PIANO. Pyrogallol, an O2 generator, significantly (p < 0.01) diminished PIANO-mediated relaxation. During PIANO-mediated relaxation, the tissue level of cyclic GMP significantly (p < 0.05) increased over that of the control. Furthermore, methylene blue, a guanylate cyclase inhibitor, significantly (p < 0.01) inhibited both the relaxation and the increase of cGMP.CONCLUSION: We concluded that rat detrusor muscle was capable of responding to NO, and these findings might lead to a treatment for bladder instability and detrusor hyperreflexia, by the use of intravesical instillation of NO donors.","['Animals', 'Arginine', 'Cyclic GMP', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Isometric Contraction', 'Male', 'Methylene Blue', 'Muscle, Smooth', 'Nitric Oxide', 'Nitric Oxide Synthase', 'Nitroarginine', 'Pyrogallol', 'Radioimmunoassay', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Streptozocin', 'Ultraviolet Rays', 'Urinary Bladder']",8618342,"[['B01.050'], ['D12.125.068.050', 'D12.125.095.104', 'D12.125.142.087'], ['D03.633.100.759.646.454.160', 'D13.695.462.275', 'D13.695.667.454.160', 'D13.695.827.426.160'], ['E05.481'], ['G11.427.494.472'], ['D02.886.369.517', 'D03.633.300.783.517'], ['A02.633.570', 'A10.690.467'], ['D01.339.387', 'D01.625.550.500', 'D01.625.700.500', 'D01.650.550.587.600'], ['D08.811.682.664.500.772'], ['D12.125.068.050.587', 'D12.125.095.104.587'], ['D02.455.426.559.389.657.800'], ['E01.370.384.700', 'E05.478.566.639', 'E05.601.470.639'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700.750'], ['D02.065.950.594.768', 'D02.654.692.768', 'D09.408.051.900'], ['G01.358.500.505.650.891', 'G01.590.540.891', 'G01.750.250.650.891', 'G01.750.750.659', 'G01.750.770.578.891', 'G16.500.275.063.725.525.600', 'G16.500.750.775.525.600', 'N06.230.300.100.725.525.600'], ['A05.810.890']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Health Care [N]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
Effects of the multiple sclerosis associated -330 promoter polymorphism in IL2 allelic expression.,"The -330 IL2 gene promoter polymorphism has been associated with multiple sclerosis (MS) [J. Neuroimmunol. 119 (2001) 101], but the basis underlying this association remains unknown to date. In the present work, we have found that IL2 promoter-luciferase constructs, transfected in Jurkat cell line, showed twofold higher levels of gene expression in the -330 G allele. However, the transcriptional effect of this polymorphism in lymphocytes showed that the G allele was related to lower expression of IL2. This difference increased in the patient group. Divergence between in vivo and in vitro influence of the -330 IL2 promoter polymorphic site suggests the existence of additional unknown polymorphisms affecting gene regulation. Our data show an increased IL2 expression among GT and TT genotypes previously associated with susceptibility to MS.","['Alleles', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Disease Susceptibility', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2', 'Luciferases', 'Lymphocytes', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'RNA, Messenger', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Statistics, Nonparametric', 'Time Factors', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Transfection']",14975604,"[['G05.360.340.024.340.030'], ['A11.251.210.190', 'A11.251.860.180'], ['C23.550.291.687', 'G07.100.250'], ['G05.297'], ['G05.308'], ['C23.550.291.687.500', 'G05.380.355'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D12.644.276.374.465.021', 'D12.644.276.374.480.372', 'D12.776.467.374.465.021', 'D12.776.467.374.480.372', 'D23.529.374.465.155', 'D23.529.374.480.372'], ['D08.811.682.517', 'D12.776.532.510'], ['A11.118.637.555.567', 'A15.145.229.637.555.567', 'A15.382.490.555.567'], ['L01.453.245.667'], ['C10.114.375.500', 'C10.314.350.500', 'C20.111.258.250.500'], ['G05.365.795'], ['G05.365.795.595'], ['G02.111.570.080.689.675', 'G05.360.080.689.675', 'G05.360.340.024.340.137.750.680'], ['D13.444.735.544'], ['E05.393.620.500.725'], ['E05.318.740.995', 'N05.715.360.750.760', 'N06.850.520.830.995'], ['G01.910.857'], ['G05.308.800'], ['E05.393.350.810', 'G05.728.860']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0
"Preparation of (001)-oriented Pb(Zr,Ti)O3 thin films and their piezoelectric applications.","Preparation of (001)-oriented Pb(Zr,Ti)O(3) (PZT) thin films and their applications to a sensor and actuators were investigated. These thin films, which have a composition close to the morphotropic phase boundary, were epitaxially grown on (100)MgO single-crystal substrates by RF magnetron sputtering. These (001)-oriented PZT thin films could be obtained on various kinds of substrates, such as glass and Si, by introducing (100)-oriented MgO buffer layers. In addition, the (001) oriented PZT thin films could be obtained on Si substrates without buffer layers by optimizing the sputtering conditions. All of these thin films showed excellent piezoelectric properties without the need for poling treatment. The PZT thin films on the MgO substrates had a high piezoelectric coefficient, d(31), of -100 pm/V, and an extremely low relative dielectric constant, epsilon(r), of 240. The PZT thin films on Si substrate had a very high d(31) of -150 pm/V and an epsilon(r) = 700. These PZT thin films were applied to an angular rate sensor with a tuning fork in a car navigation system, to a dual-stage actuator for positioning the magnetic head of a high-density hard disk drive, and to an actuator for an inkjet printer head for industrial on-demand printers.","['Electrochemistry', 'Equipment Design', 'Equipment Failure Analysis', 'Lead', 'Materials Testing', 'Membranes, Artificial', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Titanium', 'Transducers', 'Ultrasonography', 'Zirconium']",18276534,"[['H01.181.529.307'], ['E05.320'], ['E05.325.192'], ['D01.268.556.435', 'D01.552.544.435'], ['E05.570'], ['D25.479', 'J01.637.051.479', 'J01.637.087.500'], ['E05.318.370.725', 'E05.337.851', 'N05.715.360.325.685', 'N06.850.520.445.725'], ['E05.318.370.800', 'E05.318.740.872', 'G17.800', 'N05.715.360.325.700', 'N05.715.360.750.725', 'N06.850.520.445.800', 'N06.850.520.830.872'], ['D01.268.557.800', 'D01.268.956.878', 'D01.552.547.800'], ['E07.305.812'], ['E01.370.350.850'], ['D01.268.556.950', 'D01.268.956.937', 'D01.552.544.950']]","['Disciplines and Occupations [H]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0
[Severe rectal bleeding after transrectal US-guided prostate biopsy. Case report].,"CASE: The Authors report their experience about a case of severe rectal bleeding after transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy.INTERVENTION: After correct and sure diagnosis, the patient was submitted to resolutive endoscopic haemostatic treatment (failure of haemostatic mechanical manoeuvres, emergency colonscopy, haemostasis with sclerotherapy, heat bipolar probe and Argon Plasma Coagulation).RESULTS: Complete recovery (immediate stop bleeding). Follow-up (1 year) negative.CONCLUSIONS: Rectal bleeding after prostate biopsy is a important but rare complication of prostate cancer screening, potentially lethal. Best knowledge of causes and risk factors may improve the diagnosis and standardize the treatment. The prostatic biopsy is surely the best procedure for the screening of prostate cancer in the population, associated with PSA dosage.","['Biopsy, Needle', 'Gastrointestinal Hemorrhage', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prostate', 'Rectal Diseases', 'Rectum', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Ultrasonography']",17064492,"[['E01.370.225.500.384.100.119', 'E01.370.225.998.054.119', 'E01.370.388.100.100', 'E04.074.119', 'E04.665.100', 'E05.200.500.384.100.119', 'E05.200.998.054.119', 'E05.242.384.100.119'], ['C06.405.227', 'C23.550.414.788'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['A05.360.444.575', 'A10.336.707'], ['C06.405.469.860'], ['A03.556.124.526.767', 'A03.556.249.249.767'], ['E05.318.308.980.438.475.456.500', 'N05.715.360.300.800.438.375.364.500', 'N06.850.520.308.980.438.475.364.500'], ['E01.370.350.850']]","['Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Health Care [N]']",1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
The peopling of Greenland: further insights from the analysis of genetic diversity using autosomal and X-chromosomal markers.,"The peopling of Greenland has a complex history shaped by population migrations, isolation and genetic drift. The Greenlanders present a genetic heritage with components of European and Inuit groups; previous studies using uniparentally inherited markers in Greenlanders have reported evidence of a sex-biased, admixed genetic background. This work further explores the genetics of the Greenlanders by analysing autosomal and X-chromosomal data to obtain deeper insights into the factors that shaped the genetic diversity in Greenlanders. Fourteen Greenlandic subsamples from multiple geographical settlements were compared to assess the level of genetic substructure in the Greenlandic population. The results showed low levels of genetic diversity in all sets of the genetic markers studied, together with an increased number of X-chromosomal loci in linkage disequilibrium in relation to the Danish population. In the broader context of worldwide populations, Greenlanders are remarkably different from most populations, but they are genetically closer to some Inuit groups from Alaska. Admixture analyses identified an Inuit component in the Greenlandic population of approximately 80%. The sub-populations of Ammassalik and Nanortalik are the least diverse, presenting the lowest levels of European admixture. Isolation-by-distance analyses showed that only 16% of the genetic substructure of Greenlanders is most likely to be explained by geographic barriers. We suggest that genetic drift and a differentiated settlement history around the island explain most of the genetic substructure of the population in Greenland.","['Chromosomes, Human, X', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genetic Variation', 'Greenland', 'Human Migration', 'Humans', 'Inuits']",24801759,"[['A11.284.187.520.300.325.680', 'A11.284.187.865.982.500', 'G05.360.162.520.300.325.680', 'G05.360.162.865.982.500'], ['D23.101.387', 'G05.695.450'], ['G05.365'], ['Z01.107.567.403', 'Z01.542.816.124.500', 'Z01.639.400'], ['I01.240.600.525', 'N01.224.625.525', 'N06.850.505.400.700.525'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.686.508.150.600.375.500', 'M01.686.508.150.675', 'M01.686.754.254.500.500']]","['Anatomy [A]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Named Groups [M]']",1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1
Gonadal function in boys with steroid-responsive nephrotic syndrome treated with cyclophosphamide for short periods.,"Semen analysis was undertaken in 19 men over the age of 18 years who had been treated during childhood for steroid-responsive nephrotic syndrome with a single course of cyclophosphamide 3 mg/kg bodyweight for 8 weeks. A further 4 men who received two such courses of treatment were also studied. Plasma total androgens and gonadotropins were also determined. A comparison group consisted of medical students investigated as potential donors for artificial insemination. Lower ejaculate volumes and sperm densities with a higher percentage of immotile and abnormal forms were detected in patients who had received cyclophosphamide. However, the abnormalities were not severe enough to suggest infertility. Plasma total androgens were lower in the patients, but there were no differences in gonadotropic hormones. The data suggest that a course of treatment with cyclophosphamide known to influence the natural history of the nephrotic syndrome is not necessarily followed by a severe abnormality of sperm production; nevertheless, great caution is still required in the use of the drug.","['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Cyclophosphamide', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Libido', 'Male', 'Nephrotic Syndrome', 'Risk', 'Sperm Motility', 'Spermatogenesis', 'Testis']",6112527,"[['M01.060.057'], ['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.406'], ['D02.455.526.728.650.730.243', 'D02.705.672.500.243'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.249', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.350', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.350'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['F02.739.794.511'], ['C12.777.419.630.643', 'C13.351.968.419.630.643'], ['E05.318.740.600.800', 'G17.680.750', 'N05.715.360.750.625.700', 'N06.850.520.830.600.800'], ['E01.370.225.992.812', 'E05.200.992.812', 'G04.198.750'], ['G04.152.650.624', 'G08.686.784.310.760'], ['A05.360.444.849', 'A05.360.576.782', 'A06.300.312.782']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
Protracted treatment with diazepam increases the turnover of putative endogenous ligands for the benzodiazepine/beta-carboline recognition site.,"DBI (diazepam-binding inhibitor) is a putative neuromodulatory peptide isolated from rat brain that acts on gamma-aminobutyric acid-benzodiazepine-Cl- ionophore receptor complex inducing beta-carboline-like effects. We used a cDNA probe complementary to DBI mRNA and a specific antibody for rat DBI to study in rat brain how the dynamic state of DBI can be affected after protracted (three times a day for 10 days) treatment with diazepam and chlordiazepoxide by oral gavage. Both the content of DBI and DBI mRNA increased in the cerebellum and cerebral cortex but failed to change in the hippocampus and striatum of rats receiving this protracted benzodiazepine treatment. Acute treatment with diazepam did not affect the dynamic state of brain DBI. An antibody was raised against a biologically active octadecaneuropeptide (Gln-Ala-Thr-Val-Gly-Asp-Val-Asn-Thr-Asp-Arg-Pro-Gly-Leu-Leu-Asp-Leu-Lys ) derived from the tryptic digestion of DBI. The combined HPLC/RIA analysis of rat cerebellar extracts carried out with this antibody showed that multiple molecular forms of the octadecaneuropeptide-like reactivity are present and all of them are increased in rats receiving repeated daily injections of diazepam. It is inferred that tolerance to benzodiazepines is associated with an increase in the turnover rate of DBI, which may be responsible for the gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor desensitization that occurs after protracted benzodiazepine administration.","['Animals', 'Brain', 'Chlordiazepoxide', 'DNA', 'Diazepam', 'Diazepam Binding Inhibitor', 'Kinetics', 'Male', 'Neuropeptides', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'RNA, Messenger', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred Strains', 'Receptors, GABA-A']",3029781,"[['B01.050'], ['A08.186.211'], ['D03.633.100.079.080.150'], ['D13.444.308'], ['D03.633.100.079.080.070.216'], ['D12.644.136'], ['G01.374.661', 'G02.111.490'], ['D12.644.400', 'D12.776.631.650'], ['E05.393.661', 'G02.111.611'], ['D13.444.735.544'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700'], ['B01.050.050.199.520.760', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700.400'], ['D12.776.157.530.400.175.562', 'D12.776.157.530.400.400.100.100', 'D12.776.543.550.450.175.562', 'D12.776.543.550.450.500.100.100', 'D12.776.543.585.400.175.562', 'D12.776.543.585.400.500.100.100', 'D12.776.543.750.130.500', 'D12.776.543.750.720.200.300.300']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Dabrafenib Therapy in 30 Patients with Melanoma Metastatic to the Brain: a Single-centre Controlled Retrospective Study in Hungary.,"Dabrafenib is a potent BRAF inhibitor, which showed intracranial tumor activity. The purpose of our retrospective analysis was to evaluate the efficacy of dabrafenib for patients with melanoma brain metastasis (BM). We studied 30 BRAF mutant melanoma patients with BM, who received dabrafenib after local control of the brain between 2014 and 2017. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (ECOG) was 0-2. The control arm consisted of 204 melanoma patients from our institutional melanoma database with BM and ECOG 0-2 treated with local therapies and/or chemotherapy, between 2003 and 2015. We found the intracranial disease control rate (DCR) was 83% including four (13%) complete remissions (CR), nine (30%) partial remissions (PR) and twelve (40%) stable diseases (SD) in contrast to five (17%) progressive diseases (PD). With a median follow-up of 14 months, median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were 5.5 months, and 8.8 months, respectively. If calculated from BM onset, the OS turned to be 11.8 months on the dabrafenib arm, while it was only 6.0 months in the control arm (HR = 0.45, p = 0.0014). Higher risk of progression was observed with increasing ECOG (HR =4.06, p = 0.00027) and if more than 2 extracranial organs were involved (HR = 3.4, p = 0.0077). Elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was non-significantly associated with worse clinical outcome.

Here we analyze the effects of maternal undernutrition during pregnancy and lactation by establishing three experimental groups of female mice divided according to their diet: control (Co), moderate calorie-protein restriction (MCP) and severe protein restriction (SP). Nutritionally restricted dams gained relatively less weight during pregnancy and the body weight of the offspring was also affected by maternal undernutrition, showing global growth restriction. We performed magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the offspring's brains after weaning and analyzed their connectivity patterns using complex graph theory. In general, changes observed in the MCP group were more subtle than in SP. Results indicated that brain structures were not homogeneously affected by early nutritional stress. In particular, the growth of central brain regions, such as the temporo-parietal cortex, and long integrative myelinated tracts were relatively preserved, while the frequency of short tracts was relatively reduced. We also found a differential effect on network parameters: network degree, clustering, characteristic path length and small-worldness remained mainly unchanged, while the rich-club index was lower in nutritionally restricted animals. Rich-club decrease reflects an impairment in the structure by which brain regions with large number of connections tend to be more densely linked among themselves. Overall, the findings presented here support the hypothesis that chronic nutritional stress produces long-term changes in brain structural connectivity.","['Animals', 'Brain', 'Female', 'Fetal Growth Retardation', 'Fetal Nutrition Disorders', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Neural Pathways', 'Pregnancy', 'Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects', 'Prenatal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena']",29631020,"[['B01.050'], ['A08.186.211'], ['C13.703.277.370', 'C16.300.390', 'C23.550.393.450'], ['C13.703.277.677', 'C18.654.521.625'], ['E01.370.350.825.500'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500'], ['B01.050.050.199.520.520.420', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500.400.420'], ['A08.612'], ['G08.686.784.769'], ['C13.703.824.500'], ['G07.203.650.566.624', 'G08.686.784.769.600']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Influence of donor and host age on the regeneration and blood flow of splenic transplants.,"After splenectomy there is an increased risk of fatal overwhelming postsplenectomy sepsis, especially in children. If all alternatives to splenectomy fail, autotransplantation of splenic fragments is indicated. These fragments regenerate after a necrotic phase to small splenic nodules. Regulatory factors governing the regeneration process are largely unknown. Inbred rats were used as a model to define the influence of recipient and donor age on the regenerated mass and the blood flow of transplanted splenic fragments. These are both important factors for the protective function of the spleen. Fetal, newborn, weanling, or adult spleens were implanted into the greater omentum of newborn, weanling, or adult rats. The younger the recipient and donor, the better the regeneration and perfusion of transplants. However, these did not reach more than 40% of the normal splenic mass. In addition, no experimental group achieved more than one third of the normal splenic blood flow. There is an obvious age dependency in splenic regeneration and blood flow, but the transplants are far from attaining a normal splenic mass and perfusion.","['Age Factors', 'Animals', 'Male', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred Lew', 'Regeneration', 'Spleen', 'Tissue Donors']",3263490,"[['N05.715.350.075', 'N06.850.490.250'], ['B01.050'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700'], ['B01.050.050.199.520.760.280', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700.400.280'], ['G16.762'], ['A10.549.700', 'A15.382.520.604.700'], ['M01.898']]","['Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Named Groups [M]']",1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
Increased expression of glutathione reductase in macrophages decreases atherosclerotic lesion formation in low-density lipoprotein receptor-deficient mice.,"OBJECTIVE: Thiol oxidative stress leads to macrophage dysfunction and cell injury, and has been implicated in the development of atherosclerotic lesions. We investigated if strengthening the glutathione-dependent antioxidant system in macrophages by overexpressing glutathione reductase (GR) decreases the severity of atherosclerosis.METHODS AND RESULTS: Bone marrow cells infected with retroviral vectors expressing either enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) or an EGFP-fusion protein of cytosolic GR (GR(cyto)-EGFP) or mitochondrial GR (GR(mito)-EGFP) were transplanted into low-density lipoprotein receptor-deficient mice. Five weeks after bone marrow transplantation, animals were challenged with a Western diet for 10 weeks. No differences in either plasma cholesterol and triglyceride levels or peritoneal macrophage content were observed. However, mice reconstituted with either GR(cyto)-EGFP or GR(mito)-EGFP-expressing bone marrow had lesion areas (P<0.009) that were 32% smaller than recipients of EGFP-expressing bone marrow. In cultured macrophages, adenovirus-mediated overexpression of GR(cyto)-EGFP or GR(mito)-EGFP protected cells from mitochondrial hyperpolarization induced by oxidized low-density lipoprotein.CONCLUSION: This study provides direct evidence that the glutathione-dependent antioxidant system in macrophages plays a critical role in atherogenesis, and suggests that thiol oxidative stress-induced mitochondrial dysfunction contributes to macrophage injury in atherosclerotic lesions.","['Adenoviridae', 'Animals', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytosol', 'Dietary Fats', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Female', 'Genetic Therapy', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Glutathione', 'Glutathione Reductase', 'Humans', 'LDL-Receptor Related Proteins', 'Lipoproteins, LDL', 'Macrophages', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mitochondria', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins', 'Retroviridae', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Time Factors', 'Transduction, Genetic']",17363688,"[['B04.280.030'], ['B01.050'], ['C14.907.137.126.307'], ['A11.148', 'A15.378.316'], ['E02.095.147.725.040', 'E04.936.580.040'], ['A11.251'], ['A11.284.430.214.200', 'A11.284.430.429.200', 'A11.284.835.450.200'], ['D10.212.302', 'G07.203.300.375', 'J02.500.375'], ['C22.232', 'E05.598.500', 'E05.599.395.080'], ['E02.095.301', 'E05.393.420.301'], ['G05.360.337'], ['D12.644.456.448'], ['D08.811.682.667.092'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D12.776.526', 'D12.776.543.750.710.450.500'], ['D10.532.515', 'D12.776.521.550'], ['A11.329.372', 'A11.627.482', 'A11.733.397', 'A15.382.670.522', 'A15.382.680.397'], ['G03.295.770.500', 'G04.580.550', 'G07.265.675.550'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500'], ['B01.050.050.199.520.520.420', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500.400.420'], ['B01.050.050.136.500.500', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500.550.455', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500.800.500'], ['A11.284.430.214.190.875.564', 'A11.284.835.626'], ['G03.673', 'G07.775.750'], ['D12.776.828.300'], ['B04.613.807', 'B04.820.650'], ['E05.318.308.980.438.475.456.500', 'N05.715.360.300.800.438.375.364.500', 'N06.850.520.308.980.438.475.364.500'], ['G01.910.857'], ['E05.393.350.800', 'G05.728.850']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]', 'Health Care [N]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0
A web service for enabling medical image retrieval integrated into a social medical image sharing platform.,"Content-based visual image access is in the process from a research domain towards real applications. So far, most image retrieval applications have been in one specialized domain such as lung CTs as diagnosis aid or for classification of general images based on anatomic region, modality, and view. This article describes the use of a content-based image retrieval system in connection with the medical image sharing platform MEDTING, so a data set with a very large variety. Similarity retrieval is possible for all cases of the social image sharing platform, so cases can be linked by either visual similarity or similarity in keywords. The visual retrieval search is based on the GIFT (GNU Image Finding Tool). The technology for updating the index with new images added by users employs RSS (Really Simple Syndication) feeds. The ARC (Advanced Resource Connector) middleware is used for the implementation of a web service for similarity retrieval, simplifying the integration of this service. Novelty of this article is the application/integration and image updating strategy. Retrieval methods themselves employ existing techniques that are all open source and can easily be reproduced.","['Diagnostic Imaging', 'Information Storage and Retrieval', 'Internet', 'Radiology Information Systems', 'User-Computer Interface']",20841889,"[['E01.370.350'], ['L01.313.500.750.280', 'L01.470'], ['L01.224.230.110.500'], ['N04.452.515.825'], ['L01.224.900.910']]","['Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Health Care [N]']",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0
Association between use of phthalate-containing medication and semen quality among men in couples referred for assisted reproduction.,"STUDY QUESTION: Does phthalate exposure from prescription drugs affect semen quality?SUMMARY ANSWER: Exposure to phthalate-containing drugs is associated with poor semen quality.WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Phthalates and their metabolites have been shown to disrupt the hormone signalling in animal studies. One study has shown associations between medicinal phthalate exposure and poor semen quality, suggesting similar effects in humans.STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: We included 18 515 males with poor semen quality (cases) and 31 063 males with normal semen quality (controls) registered in the Danish IVF Registry from 2006 to 2016.PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Exposure to phthalate-containing drugs was assessed from the Danish Register of Medicinal Product Statistics. Outcome measures were obtained at the first contact with the fertility clinic, and categorized according to the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10). The association between current use of phthalate-containing medications <90 days prior to semen sampling and reduced semen quality was analysed using unconditional logistic regression, adjusting for potential confounders.MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: In total, 57 cases and 72 controls redeemed at least one prescription for a drug containing ortho-phthalates in the 90 days before their first semen sample, yielding an adjusted odds ratio (OR) of 1.30 (95% CI: 0.91-1.85) for poor semen quality when compared to males exposed to phthalate-free generic drugs. Similarly, 81 cases and 78 controls exposed to a drug containing polymers had increased odds of poor semen quality (OR = 1.71, 95% CI: 1.24-2.35). Current exposure to polymer containing products from alimentary tract and metabolism drugs was associated with the highest OR of 2.80 (95% CI: 1.63-4.84). Comparing males exposed to drugs containing ortho-phthalates or polymers with males unexposed to prescription drugs, we found adjusted ORs of 1.32 (95% CI: 0.93-1.87) and 1.73 (95% CI: 1.26-2.36), respectively. We saw no clear relationship between degree of exposure and odds of poor semen quality.LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: The reliance on ICD-10 based register data restricted our ability to relate phthalate exposure to detailed semen parameters. Furthermore, due to imperfections in the registry, we could only include the first semen sample and could not follow semen quality over time.WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: Our results support the likely negative effect of phthalate exposure from medicinal drugs on semen quality. As exposures from medicinal products are readily avoidable, our findings may be of relevance to regulatory authorities.STUDY FUNDING/COMPETING INTEREST(S): This work was supported by Odense University Hospital, Denmark (Grant number A1003).

Acyl-CoA Synthetase 5 Promotes the Growth and Invasion of Colorectal Cancer Cells.,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Acyl-CoA synthetase 5 (ACS5) has been reported to be associated with the development of various cancers, but the role of it in colorectal cancer (CRC) is not well understood. The present study aimed to explore the potential role of ACS5 in the development and progression of CRC.METHODS: ACS5 expression in CRC tissues and CRC cell lines was examined, and its clinical significance was analyzed. The role of ACS5 in cell proliferation, apoptosis, and invasion was examined in vitro.RESULTS: We found that ACS5 expression was upregulated in CRC cells and CRC tissues and that high ACS5 expression was more frequent in CRC patients with excess muscular layer and with poor tumor differentiation. Furthermore, knockdown of ACS5 in HT29 and SW480 cells significantly dampened cell proliferation, induced cell apoptosis, and reduced cell migration and invasion. In contrast, the ectopic overexpression of ACS5 in LOVO and SW620 cells remarkably promoted cell proliferation, inhibited cell apoptosis, and enhanced cell migration and invasion. Enhanced cell growth and invasion ability mediated by the gain of ACS5 expression were associated with downregulation of caspase-3 and E-cadherin and upregulation of survivin and CD44.CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate that ACS5 can promote the growth and invasion of CRC cells and provide a potential target for CRC gene therapy.","['Cadherins', 'Caspase 3', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Movement', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Coenzyme A Ligases', 'Colorectal Neoplasms', 'Disease Progression', 'Down-Regulation', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'HT29 Cells', 'Humans', 'Hyaluronan Receptors', 'Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness', 'Survivin', 'Up-Regulation']",28808653,"[['D12.776.395.550.200.200', 'D12.776.543.550.200.200', 'D23.050.301.350.200'], ['D08.811.277.656.262.500.126.350.300', 'D08.811.277.656.300.200.126.350.300', 'D12.644.360.075.405.350.300', 'D12.776.476.075.405.350.300'], ['A11.251.210.190', 'A11.251.860.180'], ['G04.198', 'G07.568.500.180'], ['G04.161.750', 'G07.345.249.410.750'], ['D08.811.464.267.500'], ['C04.588.274.476.411.307', 'C06.301.371.411.307', 'C06.405.249.411.307', 'C06.405.469.158.356', 'C06.405.469.491.307', 'C06.405.469.860.180'], ['C23.550.291.656'], ['G02.111.240', 'G05.308.200', 'G07.690.773.937'], ['G05.308.370'], ['E05.393.335.500'], ['A11.251.210.190.475', 'A11.251.860.180.475', 'A11.436.365'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D09.698.735.200.625', 'D12.776.395.550.200.625.144', 'D12.776.395.650.750.281', 'D12.776.543.550.200.625.144', 'D12.776.543.750.705.877.144', 'D23.050.301.350.625.144'], ['D08.811.464.938.750.210', 'D12.644.360.075.437', 'D12.776.476.075.437'], ['C04.697.645', 'C23.550.727.645'], ['D12.644.360.075.437.625', 'D12.776.167.576', 'D12.776.220.600.450.495', 'D12.776.476.075.437.625'], ['G02.111.905', 'G05.308.850', 'G07.690.773.998']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

[Ovarian cancer--a comparison between CT diagnosis and serum tumor markers].,"In 40 patients undergoing pre-treatment for an ovarian tumor, a CT scan of the pelvis and measurements of their CA 125, CA 19-9, IAP (immunosuppressive acidic antigen), and TPA (tissue polypeptide antigen were performed. The specificity and sensitivity of the CT diagnosis was found to be better than any of other tumor markers measurements. Comparison of the 4 markers showed that the CA 125 testing had the greatest sensitivity in detecting an ovarian cancer. Moreover, the sensitivity of CA 125, was better than a combination of the 4 markers.

Ribonucleotide reductase M1 expression in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma.,"BACKGROUND/AIMS: Ribonucleotide reductase M1 (RRM1) is a key molecule for gemcitabine resistance. This study evaluated the immunohistochemical expression of RRM1 in resected specimens of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) and investigated the efficacy of gemcitabine-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy in relation to RRM1 expression in tumors.METHODOLOGY: A retrospective analysis was conducted on 34 consecutive Japanese patients who underwent resection of ICC. Of the 34 patients, 2 were treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy consisting of gemcitabine 800mg/m2 every 2 weeks to address extrahepatic tumor extension. Expression of RRM1 in tumor specimens was assessed using immunohistochemistry and was classified as either positive or negative.RESULTS: RRM1-positive expression was detected in 19/34 (56%) tumor specimens. Two patients were treated with gemcitabine-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy; one had a tumor specimen showing RRM1-positive expression and showed a 14% tumor reduction rate (stable disease); another patient had a tumor showing RRM1-negative expression and showed a 68% tumor reduction rate (partial response). Surgical procedures planned before administration of neoadjuvant chemotherapy were performed in both patients.CONCLUSIONS: Neoadjuvant chemotherapy with gemcitabine for locally advanced ICC was well tolerated and did not impair planned surgical resections. Tumor expression of RRM1 may determine the efficacy of gemcitabine-based chemotherapy for patients with ICC.","['Adult', 'Aged', 'Bile Duct Neoplasms', 'Bile Ducts, Intrahepatic', 'Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Chi-Square Distribution', 'Cholangiocarcinoma', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Liver Neoplasms', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoadjuvant Therapy', 'Ribonucleotide Reductases', 'Survival Rate', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed']",21940346,"[['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['C04.588.274.120.250', 'C06.130.120.120', 'C06.130.320.120', 'C06.301.120.250'], ['A03.159.183.158', 'A03.620.150'], ['D23.101.140'], ['E05.318.740.994.300', 'G17.820.300', 'N05.715.360.750.750.200', 'N06.850.520.830.994.300'], ['C04.557.470.200.025.450'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E05.478.566.350', 'E05.478.583.400', 'E05.601.470.350'], ['C04.588.274.623', 'C06.301.623', 'C06.552.697'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['E02.186.450'], ['D08.811.682.810'], ['E05.318.308.985.550.900', 'N01.224.935.698.826', 'N06.850.505.400.975.550.900', 'N06.850.520.308.985.550.900'], ['E01.370.350.350.810', 'E01.370.350.600.350.700.810', 'E01.370.350.700.700.810', 'E01.370.350.700.810.810', 'E01.370.350.825.810.810']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
Sclerosing mucoepidermoid carcinoma with eosinophilia of the salivary glands.,"We encountered two cases of low malignant mucoepidermoid carcinoma with scanty cellular atypism which originated in the parotid or submandibular gland and was characterized by marked fibrosis and eosinophilic infiltration within tumor tissue despite the predominance of the squamous component. Here we report these two cases and provide a review of the literature. We believe that clinically these two tumors with stromal fibrosis and eosinophilic infiltration have a low malignant potential, although histological examination revealed a scanty mucus-producing epithelial component. Therefore, we consider this type of tumor as a new subtype of mucoepidermoid carcinoma. A low-malignant mucoepidermoid carcinoma with stromal fibrosis and eosinophilic infiltration, as described in these two cases, may be misdiagnosed as a highly malignant mucoepidermoid carcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma because of its histologically scanty mucus-producing epithelial component. The objective of this study was to clarify their differences and to discuss the rendering of an accurate histological diagnosis, the degree of malignancy in relation to prognosis prediction, and the choice of therapy. In addition, we propose regarding this type of tumor as a new subtype of mucoepidermoid carcinoma.","['Adult', 'Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Carcinoma, Mucoepidermoid', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Eosinophilia', 'Female', 'Fibrosis', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Lymphatic Metastasis', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Parotid Neoplasms', 'Sclerosis', 'Submandibular Gland Neoplasms']",12049340,"[['M01.060.116'], ['D23.101.140'], ['C04.557.470.200.025.340', 'C04.557.470.590.340'], ['E01.171'], ['C15.378.553.231'], ['C23.550.355'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E01.370.225.500.607.512', 'E01.370.225.750.551.512', 'E05.200.500.607.512', 'E05.200.750.551.512', 'E05.478.583', 'H01.158.100.656.234.512', 'H01.158.201.344.512', 'H01.158.201.486.512', 'H01.181.122.573.512', 'H01.181.122.605.512'], ['C04.697.650.560', 'C23.550.727.650.560'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['C04.588.443.591.824.695', 'C07.465.530.824.695', 'C07.465.815.470.770', 'C07.465.815.718.589'], ['C23.550.823'], ['C04.588.443.591.824.885', 'C07.465.530.824.885', 'C07.465.815.718.885', 'C07.465.815.882.500']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0
Round-headed spermatozoa in semen specimens from fertile and subfertile men.,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the frequency of round-headed, or acrosomeless, spermatozoa, determine the percentage and evaluate the possible correlation with other semen parameters.STUDY DESIGN: Semen specimens from 114 subfertile men aged 24-53 years (mean +/- SD 33.3 +/- 6.3) and from 60 fertile men aged 24-44 years (33.1 +/- 4.2) were studied. Two semen specimens were examined from each individual, with a six- to eight-week interval. Sperm morphology was evaluated from Papanicolaou-stained smears, and the classification of abnormal sperm forms was made according to WHO guidelines.RESULTS: The percentage of round-headed spermatozoa was 2.3% +/- 0.5 in subfertile and 0.5% +/- 0.1 in fertile men. Round-headed spermatozoa existed in semen specimens from 36.8% of subfertile and 25.0% fertile men. Of subfertile men, 14.9% had round-headed spermatozoa at a higher percentage than the highest normal limit found in sperm smears from fertile men.CONCLUSION: In some subfertile men with a high percentage of round-headed spermatozoa, infertility could be attributed to the cause of this morphologic abnormality. Moreover, morphologic abnormalities in the neck were significantly more frequent in round-headed spermatozoa than in spermatozoa with normal heads.","['Acrosome', 'Adult', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Humans', 'Infertility, Male', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Semen', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Sperm Count', 'Sperm Injections, Intracytoplasmic', 'Sperm Midpiece', 'Sperm Motility', 'Sperm-Ovum Interactions']",12092019,"[['A05.360.490.890.820.100', 'A11.284.430.214.190.875.190.550.040', 'A11.497.760.400.100'], ['M01.060.116'], ['E05.318.372.500.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.500'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C12.294.365.700'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['A12.200.732'], ['E05.318.308.980.438.475.456.500', 'N05.715.360.300.800.438.375.364.500', 'N06.850.520.308.980.438.475.364.500'], ['E01.370.225.500.195.870', 'E01.370.225.992.624', 'E05.200.500.195.870', 'E05.200.992.624', 'E05.242.195.870', 'G04.140.870'], ['E02.875.800.750.700', 'E05.820.800.750.700'], ['A05.360.490.890.830', 'A11.497.760.450'], ['E01.370.225.992.812', 'E05.200.992.812', 'G04.198.750'], ['G08.686.784.277.800']]","['Anatomy [A]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
"Primary rhabdomyosarcoma of the cerebellum--a light, electron microscopic, and immunohistochemical study.","A primary cerebellar rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) in a six and a half year old boy is reported. Microscopy of the surgical material revealed lobules of closely packed cells with a high mitotic rate, pleomorphic hyperchromatic nuclei and scant cytoplasm. At their periphery, the lobules merged with rounded cells with similar nuclei but more abundant cytoplasm. These areas were surrounded by interlacing fascicles of strap cells, which were occasionally multinucleated and showed cross striations. Electron microscopy (EM) revealed the primitive nature of the closely packed cells; however, occasional intermediate size filaments were present within their cytoplasm and focal basement membrane accumulation was observed. Cells with more abundant cytoplasm had large accumulations of thick and thin filaments while strap cells showed well-developed cross striations. Immunohistochemical studies (peroxidase-antiperoxidase technique) showed vimentin in the primitive cells and desmin, myoglobin and adenosine triphosphatase as the tumor cells appeared more differentiated. Immunoreaction with antibodies against glial fibrillary acidic protein, S-100 protein and neurofilament protein were negative. Electron microscopic and immunohistochemical studies in this case demonstrated that this was an exclusively mesenchymal tumor with rhabdomyoblastic differentiation and that the pattern of differentiation follows that seen in normal myogenesis.","['Cerebellar Neoplasms', 'Child', 'Humans', 'Immunochemistry', 'Male', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Rhabdomyosarcoma']",6737010,"[['C04.588.614.250.195.411.211', 'C10.228.140.211.500.200', 'C10.228.140.252.200', 'C10.551.240.250.400.300'], ['M01.060.406'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['H01.158.201.486', 'H01.181.122.605', 'H02.403.044.500'], ['E01.370.350.515.402', 'E05.595.402'], ['C04.557.450.590.550.660', 'C04.557.450.795.550.660']]","['Diseases [C]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0
A medical geographical anniversary.,"It is now 200 years since L. L. Finke wrote his treatise on a global medical geography, Versuch einer allgemeinen medicinisch-praktischen Geographie. It was both the most extensive book in substantive content, and the most detailed in conceptual discussion on medical geography written to that point. Although it is one of the foundation pieces of medical geography, modern day practitioners seldom refer to Finke's work. There are two main reasons for this: with the exception of two passages, the work has never been translated from the original German, and many contemporary medical geographers believe that the field only developed in the mid-twentieth century. This paper's purpose is to demonstrate that this last point is unfounded and that recognition of Finke's seminal contribution is long over-due. On the 200th anniversary of the publication of An Attempt at a General Medical-Practical Geography Finke's great achievement is honoured.","['Geography', 'Germany', 'History, 18th Century', 'Humans', 'Manuscripts, Medical as Topic']",8211285,"[['H01.277.500'], ['Z01.542.315'], ['K01.400.504.875'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['L01.178.682.608.526']]","['Disciplines and Occupations [H]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Humanities [K]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Information Science [L]']",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1
"PRELI, the human homologue of the avian px19, is expressed by germinal center B lymphocytes.","We report the identification of a human cDNA encoding a 25 kDa protein of relevant evolutionary and lymphoid interest (PRELI). PRELI was cloned by screening a B lymphocyte-specific cDNA library with a probe generated by mRNA differential display. PRELI amino acid sequence is 85% similar to the avian px19 protein, expressed within the blood islands and in the liver during avian embryo development. PRELI and px19 contain tandem repeats (A/TAEKAK) of the late embryogenesis abundant (LEA) motif, characteristic of a group of survival molecules and originally thought to be present only in plant proteins. Interestingly, PRELI expression is high in the fetal liver, a major site for B cell lymphopoiesis, while the mRNA levels in other fetal tissues such as the brain, lung, and kidney are comparatively low. At the adult stage, PRELI expression is drastically reduced in the liver but exhibits high mRNA levels in the spleen, brain, lung and kidney tissues, suggesting that PRELI expression may be important for the development of vital and immunocompetent organs. Moreover, PRELI is also highly expressed in the adult lymph nodes and peripheral blood leukocytes, further stressing that at the adult stage, PRELI expression may be important during secondary immune responses. Consistent with this hypothesis, the expression of PRELI is predominant within germinal centers (GC), a stage in which B lymphocytes are under a stressful selection pressure. Taken together these data: (i) strongly support the notion that the conserved LEA motif represents a phylogenetic link between plants and animals, (ii) reveal a novel molecule whose expression may play a role in the maturation of distinct human tissues, and (iii) suggest that PRELI expression may be important for GC B lymphocytes.","['Adult', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Cell Line', 'DNA, Complementary', 'Evolution, Molecular', 'Fetus', 'Germinal Center', 'Humans', 'Mitochondrial Proteins', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Proteins', 'Quail', 'RNA, Messenger', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Viscera']",10784606,"[['M01.060.116'], ['G02.111.570.060', 'L01.453.245.667.060'], ['B01.050'], ['A11.063.438', 'A11.118.637.555.567.562', 'A15.145.229.637.555.567.562', 'A15.382.032.438', 'A15.382.490.555.567.562'], ['E05.196.401.095', 'E05.301.300.074', 'E05.601.100'], ['A11.251.210'], ['D13.444.308.497.220', 'D13.444.600.223.500', 'D27.720.470.530.600.223.260'], ['G05.045.250', 'G16.075.250'], ['A16.378'], ['A10.549.400.500', 'A15.382.520.604.412.500'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D12.776.575'], ['L01.453.245.667'], ['D12.776'], ['B01.050.150.900.248.350.650'], ['D13.444.735.544'], ['E05.393.751'], ['A01.960']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0

Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1-mediated cell death in astrocytes requires NAD+ depletion and mitochondrial permeability transition.,"Extensive activation of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) by DNA damage is a major cause of caspase-independent cell death in ischemia and inflammation. Here we show that NAD(+) depletion and mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT) are sequential and necessary steps in PARP-1-mediated cell death. Cultured mouse astrocytes were treated with the cytotoxic concentrations of N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine or 3-morpholinosydnonimine to induce DNA damage and PARP-1 activation. The resulting cell death was preceded by NAD(+) depletion, mitochondrial membrane depolarization, and MPT. Sub-micromolar concentrations of cyclosporin A blocked MPT and cell death, suggesting that MPT is a necessary step linking PARP-1 activation to cell death. In astrocytes, extracellular NAD(+) can raise intracellular NAD(+) concentrations. To determine whether NAD(+) depletion is necessary for PARP-1-induced MPT, NAD(+) was restored to near-normal levels after PARP-1 activation. Restoration of NAD(+) enabled the recovery of mitochondrial membrane potential and blocked both MPT and cell death. Furthermore, both cyclosporin A and NAD(+) blocked translocation of the apoptosis-inducing factor from mitochondria to nuclei, a step previously shown necessary for PARP-1-induced cell death. These results suggest that NAD(+) depletion and MPT are necessary intermediary steps linking PARP-1 activation to AIF translocation and cell death.","['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Apoptosis Inducing Factor', 'Astrocytes', 'Flavoproteins', 'Intracellular Membranes', 'Membrane Potentials', 'Membrane Proteins', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mitochondria', 'NAD', 'Permeability', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases', 'Protein Transport']",14960594,"[['B01.050'], ['G04.146.954.035'], ['D08.811.682.608.047', 'D12.644.360.075.311', 'D12.776.157.687.063', 'D12.776.331.161', 'D12.776.476.075.311', 'D12.776.660.720.063'], ['A08.637.200', 'A11.650.200'], ['D12.776.331'], ['A11.284.149.450', 'A11.284.835.514'], ['G01.154.535', 'G04.580', 'G07.265.675', 'G11.561.570'], ['D12.776.543'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500'], ['B01.050.050.136.500.500', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500.550.455', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500.800.500'], ['A11.284.430.214.190.875.564', 'A11.284.835.626'], ['D03.633.100.759.646.138.694', 'D08.211.589', 'D13.695.667.138.694', 'D13.695.827.068.694'], ['G02.723'], ['D08.811.913.400.725.115.690'], ['G03.143.700']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

An improvement in the quality of erythrocyte concentrates simultaneously produced can be regarded as an additional advantage with respect to the formation of microaggregates during the time the stored blood can be made use of.","['Blood Preservation', 'Factor VIII', 'Freezing', 'Humans', 'Time Factors']",2435639,"[['E02.792.833.230', 'E05.760.833.230'], ['D12.776.124.125.350', 'D12.776.811.286', 'D23.119.350'], ['G01.645.500', 'G01.906.595.272.437', 'G02.734.466'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['G01.910.857']]","['Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]']",0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
In vivo Angiotensin II AT1 receptor blockade selectively inhibits LPS-induced innate immune response and ACTH release in rat pituitary gland.,"Systemic lipopolysaccharide (LPS) administration induces an innate immune response and stimulates the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. We studied Angiotensin II AT(1) receptor participation in the LPS effects with focus on the pituitary gland. LPS (50 microg/kg, i.p.) enhanced, 3h after administration, gene expression of pituitary CD14 and that of Angiotensin II AT(1A) receptors in pituitary and hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN); stimulated ACTH and corticosterone release; decreased pituitary CRF(1) receptor mRNA and increased all plasma and pituitary pro-inflammatory factors studied. The AT(1) receptor blocker (ARB) candesartan (1mg/kg/day, s.c. daily for 3 days before LPS) blocked pituitary and PVN AT(1) receptors, inhibited LPS-induced ACTH but not corticosterone secretion and decreased LPS-induced release of TNF-alpha, IL-1beta and IL-6 to the circulation. The ARB reduced LPS-induced pituitary gene expression of IL-6, LIF, iNOS, COX-2 and IkappaB-alpha; and prevented LPS-induced increase of nNOS/eNOS activity. The ARB did not affect LPS-induced TNF-alpha and IL-1beta gene expression, IL-6 or IL-1beta protein content or LPS-induced decrease of CRF(1) receptors. When administered alone, the ARB increased basal plasma corticosterone levels and basal PGE(2) mRNA in pituitary. Our results demonstrate that the pituitary gland is a target for systemically administered LPS. AT(1) receptor activity is necessary for the complete pituitary response to LPS and is limited to specific pro-inflammatory pathways. There is a complementary and complex influence of the PVN and circulating cytokines on the initial pituitary response to LPS. Our findings support the proposal that ARBs may be considered for the treatment of inflammatory conditions.","['Adrenocorticotropic Hormone', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Angiotensin II Type 1 Receptor Blockers', 'Animals', 'Autoradiography', 'Benzimidazoles', 'Corticosterone', 'Cytokines', 'Dinoprostone', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Hypothalamo-Hypophyseal System', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'Inflammation', 'Lipopolysaccharides', 'Male', 'Paraventricular Hypothalamic Nucleus', 'Pituitary-Adrenal System', 'RNA, Messenger', 'Radioimmunoassay', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar', 'Receptor, Angiotensin, Type 1', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tetrazoles']",19427376,"[['D06.472.699.327.935.531.500', 'D06.472.699.631.525.600.531.500', 'D12.644.400.400.935.531.500', 'D12.644.548.365.935.531.500', 'D12.644.548.691.525.690.531.500', 'D12.776.631.650.405.935.531.500'], ['E05.318.740.150', 'N05.715.360.750.125', 'N06.850.520.830.150'], ['D27.505.519.162.500'], ['B01.050'], ['E01.370.225.750.132', 'E05.200.750.132', 'E05.799.256'], ['D03.633.100.103'], ['D04.210.500.745.745.654.237', 'D06.472.040.585.353.237'], ['D12.644.276.374', 'D12.776.467.374', 'D23.529.374'], ['D10.251.355.255.550.250.200', 'D23.469.050.175.725.250.200'], ['E05.478.566.350.170', 'E05.478.566.380.360', 'E05.478.583.400.170', 'E05.601.470.350.170', 'E05.601.470.380.360'], ['A06.688.357', 'A08.186.211.180.497.352.435', 'A08.186.211.200.317.357.352.435', 'A08.713.357'], ['E01.370.225.500.620.670.325', 'E01.370.225.750.600.670.325', 'E05.200.500.620.670.325', 'E05.200.750.600.670.325', 'E05.393.661.475'], ['C23.550.470'], ['D09.400.500', 'D09.698.718.450', 'D10.494', 'D23.050.161.616.525', 'D23.946.123.329.500'], ['A08.186.211.180.497.342.400', 'A08.186.211.200.317.357.342.400'], ['A06.300.691'], ['D13.444.735.544'], ['E01.370.384.700', 'E05.478.566.639', 'E05.601.470.639'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700.900'], ['D12.776.543.750.695.047.625', 'D12.776.543.750.750.130.750'], ['E05.393.620.500.725'], ['D03.383.129.617']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Diseases [C]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
"Syntheses, calcium channel agonist-antagonist modulation activities, and voltage-clamp studies of isopropyl 1,4-dihydro-2,6-dimethyl-3-nitro-4-pyridinylpyridine-5-carboxylate racemates and enantiomers.","A novel group of racemic isopropyl 1,4-dihydro-2,6-dimethyl-3-nitro-4-pyridinylpyridine-5-carboxylate isomers [(+/-)-12-14] were prepared using a modified Hantzsch reaction that involved the condensation of nitroacetone with isopropyl 3-aminocrotonate and 2-, 3-, or 4-pyridinecarboxaldehyde. Determination of their in vitro calcium channel-modulating activities using guinea pig ileum longitudinal smooth muscle (GPILSM) and guinea pig left atrium (GPLA) assays showed that the 2-pyridinyl isomer (+/-)-12 acted as a dual cardioselective calcium channel agonist (GPLA)/smooth muscle selective calcium channel antagonist (GPILSM). In contrast, the 3-pyridinyl [(+/-)-13] and 4-pyridinyl [(+/-)-14] isomers acted as calcium channel agonists on both GPLA and GPILSM. The agonist effect exhibited by (+/-)-12 on GPLA was inhibited by nifedipine and partially reversed by addition of extracellular Ca2+. In anesthetized rabbits, the 4-pyridinyl isomer (+/-)-14 exhibited a hypertensive effect that was qualitatively similar to that exhibited by the nonselective agonist Bay K 8644 and the 3-pyridinyl isomer (+/)-13, whereas the 2-pyridinyl isomer (+/-)-12 induced a hypotensive effect similar to that of the calcium channel antagonist nifedipine. Similar results were obtained in a spontaneously hypertensive rat model. In vitro studies showed that the (+)-2-pyridinyl enantiomer (+)-12A exhibited agonist activity on both GPILSM and GPLA, but that the (-)-2-pyridinyl enantiomer (-)-12B exhibited agonist activity on GPLA and antagonist activity on GPILSM. Whole-cell voltage-clamp studies using isolated guinea pig ventricular myocytes indicated that (-)-12B inhibited the calcium current (ICa), that (+)-12A increased slightly ICa, and that (+/-)-12 inhibited ICa but the latter inhibition was less than that for (-)-12B. (-)-12B effectively inhibited ICa at all membrane potentials examined (-40-50 mV), whereas (+)-12A exhibited a weak agonist effect near the peak of the I-V curve. The 2-pyridinyl isomers (enantiomers) 12 represent a novel type of 1,4-dihydropyridine calcium channel modulator that could provide a potentially new approach to drug discovery targeted toward the treatment of congestive heart failure and probes to study the structure-function relationships of calcium channels.","['3-Pyridinecarboxylic acid, 1,4-dihydro-2,6-dimethyl-5-nitro-4-(2-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)-, Methyl ester', 'Animals', 'Calcium Channel Agonists', 'Calcium Channel Blockers', 'Carboxylic Acids', 'Guinea Pigs', 'Heart', 'Heart Ventricles', 'Hypertension', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Male', 'Membrane Potentials', 'Muscle Contraction', 'Muscle, Smooth', 'Myocardial Contraction', 'Nifedipine', 'Pyridines', 'Rabbits', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred SHR', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Stereoisomerism', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",7543577,"[['D03.383.725.203.600', 'D03.383.725.547.900'], ['B01.050'], ['D27.505.519.562.124', 'D27.505.696.260.250', 'D27.505.954.411.793.205'], ['D27.505.519.562.249', 'D27.505.696.260.500', 'D27.505.954.411.192'], ['D02.241'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.550'], ['A07.541'], ['A07.541.560'], ['C14.907.489'], ['E05.481'], ['G01.154.535', 'G04.580', 'G07.265.675', 'G11.561.570'], ['G11.427.494'], ['A02.633.570', 'A10.690.467'], ['G09.330.580', 'G11.427.494.570'], ['D03.383.725.203.540'], ['D03.383.725'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.968.700'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700'], ['B01.050.050.199.520.760.300', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700.400.300'], ['E05.318.370.800', 'E05.318.740.872', 'G17.800', 'N05.715.360.325.700', 'N05.715.360.750.725', 'N06.850.520.445.800', 'N06.850.520.830.872'], ['G02.607.445.682'], ['G02.111.830', 'G07.690.773.997']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Health Care [N]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
Is accredited social health activists' basic oral health knowledge appropriate in educating rural Indian population?,"INTRODUCTION: Accredited social health activists (ASHAs) are the grassroot level health activists in the community who are involved in health education and community mobilization toward utilizing the health services.MATERIALS AND METHODS: A descriptive cross-sectional study was carried out to assess the oral health knowledge among ASHAs working in Guntur district of Andhra Pradesh, India. Five Primary Health Centers were randomly selected, and the total sample was 275. Categorical data were analyzed using Chi-square test. P ? 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.RESULTS: The mean age was 32 ± 5.11 years and mean education was 9 ± 1.329 years of schooling. ASHAs were categorized into two groups based on their education levels, i.e., Group I whose education qualification is <10th class and Group II whose education qualification is above 10th class to observe any difference in knowledge based on their education. Overall knowledge among ASHAs was poor and also it was observed that both the groups were having poor knowledge regarding dental caries, calculus, dental plaque, oral cancer, and change of tooth brush. About 69.5% of the ASHAs were approached by public with dental problems, but only a few, i.e., 15.8% have referred the patients to the nearby dentist.CONCLUSION: As we know that most of the dental diseases are preventable, there is a dire need that ASHAs should be thoroughly educated in the aspects of oral health and diseases during their training period. This not only helps in creating awareness among them but also serves the ultimate purpose of improving the oral health of rural population.","['Accreditation', 'Adult', 'Community Health Workers', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Educational Status', 'Female', 'Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice', 'Humans', 'India', 'Male', 'Oral Health', 'Rural Health Services', 'Rural Population', 'Workforce']",29072211,"[['N03.706.110.070', 'N05.700.200.100'], ['M01.060.116'], ['M01.526.485.067.080', 'N02.360.067.080'], ['E05.318.372.500.875', 'N05.715.360.330.500.875', 'N06.850.520.450.500.875'], ['N01.824.196'], ['F01.100.150.500', 'N05.300.150.410'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['Z01.252.245.393'], ['N01.400.535'], ['N02.421.816'], ['N01.600.725'], ['N04.452.525']]","['Health Care [N]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Geographicals [Z]']",0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1
Disease and immunity in the pre-Spanish Philippines.,"It is generally asserted that Filipino populations did not suffer the same demographic collapse that followed Spanish conquest in the Americas because they had previously acquired immunity to Old World diseases through trading contacts with Asia. This assertion is examined by trying to establish which diseases were present in the islands in pre-Spanish times and whether populations there could have acquired immunity to them. This is done through an analysis of the evidence for the presence of infections in China and Japan in particular and the existence of trading contacts with and between the Philippine islands. The likelihood of immunity being acquired is addressed first through a discussion of the physical and human geography of the islands and what is known of the epidemiology of individual diseases from modern scientific research. Second, it reviews evidence from early colonial documents and Filipino dictionaries for the presence and impact of Old World diseases in the early colonial period. The study suggests that Filipino populations had not acquired significant immunities to acute infections in pre-Spanish times, and that their limited demographic impact in the colonial period derived more from the particular geography of the islands. It suggests that in terms of its disease history, the Philippines had more in common with the Pacific islands than mainland Asia, and that the microbiological boundary between the Old World and the New is better conceived of as a broad zone.","['China', 'Colonialism', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Disease Vectors', 'Emigration and Immigration', 'Environmental Microbiology', 'History, 16th Century', 'History, 17th Century', 'History, 18th Century', 'History, 19th Century', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Innate', 'Infections', 'Japan', 'Philippines', 'Population Dynamics', 'Topography, Medical']",10405020,"[['Z01.252.474.164'], ['I01.696.116'], ['N06.850.290'], ['N06.850.335.188', 'N06.850.520.203.375'], ['I01.240.600.525.500', 'N01.224.625.525.500', 'N06.850.505.400.700.525.500'], ['H01.158.273.540.274', 'N06.850.425'], ['K01.400.475.750'], ['K01.400.504.750'], ['K01.400.504.875'], ['K01.400.504.937'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['G12.450.564'], ['C01'], ['Z01.252.474.463', 'Z01.639.595'], ['Z01.252.145.671', 'Z01.639.790'], ['I01.240.600', 'N01.224.625', 'N06.850.505.400.700'], ['H01.277.500.097.500', 'H02.403.352.500']]","['Geographicals [Z]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]', 'Humanities [K]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Diseases [C]']",0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1
Effects of dietary eritadenine on the liver microsomal Delta6-desaturase activity and its mRNA in rats.,"Eritadenine, a hypocholesterolemic factor of Lentinus edodes mushroom, has a wide range of effects on lipid metabolism such as an increase in the liver microsomal phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) concentration, a decrease in the liver microsomal Delta6-desaturase activity, and an alteration of the fatty acid and molecular species profile of liver and plasma lipids. In this study, the time-dependent effects of dietary eritadenine on several variables concerning lipid metabolism were investigated in rats to clarify the sequence of metabolic changes caused by eritadenine, with special interest in the association of the liver microsomal phospholipid profile and the activity of Delta6-desaturase. The effect of dietary eritadenine on the abundance of mRNA for Delta6-desaturase was also investigated. When the time required for a half-change of variables was estimated during the first 5 days after the change from the control diet to the eritadenine-supplemented (50 mg/kg) diet, the change rates of the variables were fastest in the following order: alteration of the liver microsomal phospholipid profile>decrease in liver microsomal Delta6-desaturase activity>alteration of the fatty acid and molecular species profiles of microsomal and plasma phosphatidylcholine (PC)>decrease in the plasma cholesterol concentration. There was a significant correlation between the Delta6-desaturase activity and liver microsomal PE concentration, but not PC concentration, or the proportion of PC and PE or the PC/PE ratio. The suppression of Delta6-desaturase activity by dietary eritadenine was accompanied by a significant reduction in the abundance of mRNA for the enzyme. These results suggest that dietary eritadenine might suppress the activity of liver microsomal Delta6-desaturase by altering the microsomal phospholipid profile, as represented by an increase in PE concentration, and that the effect of eritadenine is mediated by the regulation of gene expression.","['Adenine', 'Animals', 'Dietary Supplements', 'Hypercholesterolemia', 'Lipids', 'Male', 'Microsomes, Liver', 'Phospholipids', 'RNA, Messenger', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar', 'Stearoyl-CoA Desaturase', 'Time Factors']",12843651,"[['D03.633.100.759.138'], ['B01.050'], ['G07.203.300.456', 'J02.500.456'], ['C18.452.584.500.500.396'], ['D10'], ['A11.284.835.540.541'], ['D10.570.755'], ['D13.444.735.544'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700.900'], ['D08.811.682.690.708.392.625'], ['G01.910.857']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
Identification of runs of homozygosity affecting female fertility and milk production traits in Finnish Ayrshire cattle.,"Inbreeding gives rise to continuous lengths of homozygous genotypes called runs of homozygosity (ROH) that occur when identical haplotypes are inherited from both parents. ROHs are enriched for deleterious recessive alleles and can therefore be linked to inbreeding depression, defined as decreased phenotypic performance of the animals. However, not all ROHs within a region are expected to have harmful effects on the trait of interest. We aimed to identify ROHs that unfavourably affect female fertility and milk production traits in the Finnish Ayrshire population. The estimated effect of ROHs with the highest statistical significance varied between parities from 9 to 17 days longer intervals from calving to first insemination, from 13 to 38 days longer intervals from first to last insemination and from 0.3 to 1.0 more insemination per conception. Similarly, for milk production traits ROHs were associated with a reduction of 208 kg for milk yield, 7 kg for protein yield and 16 kg for fat yield. We also found regions where ROHs displayed unfavourable effects across multiple traits. Our findings can be exploited for more efficient control of inbreeding depression, for example by minimizing the occurrence of unfavourable haplotypes as homozygous state in breeding programmes.","['Animals', 'Cattle', 'Female', 'Fertility', 'Genotype', 'Homozygote', 'Milk']",32123255,"[['B01.050'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.500.380.271'], ['G08.686.210'], ['G05.380'], ['G05.380.554'], ['A12.200.455', 'A12.790', 'G07.203.100.700', 'G07.203.300.350.525', 'J02.200.700', 'J02.500.350.525']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]']",1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
Spread of anti-malarial drug resistance: mathematical model with implications for ACT drug policies.,"BACKGROUND: Most malaria-endemic countries are implementing a change in anti-malarial drug policy to artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT). The impact of different drug choices and implementation strategies is uncertain. Data from many epidemiological studies in different levels of malaria endemicity and in areas with the highest prevalence of drug resistance like borders of Thailand are certainly valuable. Formulating an appropriate dynamic data-driven model is a powerful predictive tool for exploring the impact of these strategies quantitatively.METHODS: A comprehensive model was constructed incorporating important epidemiological and biological factors of human, mosquito, parasite and treatment. The iterative process of developing the model, identifying data needed, and parameterization has been taken to strongly link the model to the empirical evidence. The model provides quantitative measures of outcomes, such as malaria prevalence/incidence and treatment failure, and illustrates the spread of resistance in low and high transmission settings. The model was used to evaluate different anti-malarial policy options focusing on ACT deployment.RESULTS: The model predicts robustly that in low transmission settings drug resistance spreads faster than in high transmission settings, and treatment failure is the main force driving the spread of drug resistance. In low transmission settings, ACT slows the spread of drug resistance to a partner drug, especially at high coverage rates. This effect decreases exponentially with increasing delay in deploying the ACT and decreasing rates of coverage. In the high transmission settings, however, drug resistance is driven by the proportion of the human population with a residual drug level, which gives resistant parasites some survival advantage. The spread of drug resistance could be slowed down by controlling presumptive drug use and avoiding the use of combination therapies containing drugs with mismatched half-lives, together with reducing malaria transmission through vector control measures.CONCLUSION: This paper has demonstrated the use of a comprehensive mathematical model to describe malaria transmission and the spread of drug resistance. The model is strongly linked to the empirical evidence obtained from extensive data available from various sources.

Electrophysiological characteristics, pharmacological response, possible mechanisms, and effects of radiofrequency ablation.","BACKGROUND: Mechanisms and electropharmacological characteristics in adult patients with atrial tachycardia (AT) are not well described. We proposed that a combination of electropharmacological characteristics, recording of monophasic action potential, and effects of radiofrequency ablation could further determine the mechanisms and achieve a new classification in adults with various types of AT because they were important in regard to the correlation between mechanisms and pathophysiology, clinical syndrome, and responses to specific pharmacological or nonpharmacological therapies.METHODS AND RESULTS: Thirty-six patients (11 female, 25 male; mean age, 57 +/- 13 years) with AT were referred for electropharmacological studies and radiofrequency ablation. Resetting response pattern, entrainment phenomenon, recording of monophasic action potential, serial drug test, response to Valsalva maneuver, endocardial mapping technique, and radiofrequency ablation were performed. Seven patients had automatic AT provocable with isoproterenol; neither initiation nor termination was related to programmed electrical stimulation. The other 29 patients had AT initiated or terminated by electrical stimulation and mechanisms related to triggered activity or reentry; nine of them needed isoproterenol to facilitate initiation of AT, associated with delayed afterdepolarization in monophasic action potential. All responded to adenosine (15 to 60 micrograms/kg) and Valsalva maneuver. Dipyridamole terminated AT and decreased the slope of afterdepolarization. Afterdepolarization was not found in the patients with automatic or reentrant AT. In 40 of 41 (98%), AT was ablated successfully, with late recurrence in 2 of 40 (5%) (follow-up, 18 +/- 4 months).CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the diverse mechanisms and electropharmacological characteristics of AT in adults. Furthermore, radiofrequency ablation of various types of AT could achieve high success and low recurrence rates.","['Adult', 'Aged', 'Cardiac Pacing, Artificial', 'Catheter Ablation', 'Electrophysiology', 'Female', 'Heart Atria', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Tachycardia, Supraventricular']",8087935,"[['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['E02.331.200'], ['E02.808.750.500', 'E04.014.760.500'], ['H01.158.344.528', 'H01.158.782.236'], ['A07.541.358'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['C14.280.067.845.880', 'C14.280.123.875.880', 'C23.550.073.845.880']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]']",1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0

Bodily embarrassment and judgment concern as separable factors in the measurement of medical embarrassment: psychometric development and links to treatment-seeking outcomes.,"OBJECTIVES: Understanding why people do not always engage in medical examinations that might benefit them is a public health issue which is receiving increased attention. One area of promise involves the study of medical embarrassment, although current studies are weakened in that they measure medical embarrassment in a theoretically na?ve and unidimensional manner and have assumed that embarrassment is exclusively a barrier to the timely seeking of treatment.DESIGN: Convenience sampling was used to recruit 116 male and 134 female students (mean age = 19.94 years, 47.2% Caucasian, 20.4% African-American, 32.4% Asian) from two large universities in different parts of the United States.METHODS: Participants completed a comprehensive measure of medical embarrassment, reported on previous treatment avoidance because of embarrassment, and recorded the frequency of psychological, general and sex-related visits across the previous 5 years.RESULTS: As expected, medical embarrassment was not unidimensional and appeared to have two distinct factors--bodily embarrassment and judgment concern. Bodily embarrassment generally predicted less frequent medical contact although not equally so across domains and it interacted with judgment concern in several cases, providing preliminary evidence that there are situations in which aspects of medical embarrassment may actually facilitate greater medical contact.CONCLUSIONS: The data highlight the importance of considering the role of emotions other than fear in health behaviour and the means by which they may facilitate or deter the timely seeking of diagnosis and treatment.","['Adult', 'Attitude to Health', 'Body Image', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Judgment', 'Male', 'Patient Acceptance of Health Care', 'Psychology', 'Psychometrics', 'Shame', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Treatment Outcome']",17640455,"[['M01.060.116'], ['F01.100.150', 'N05.300.150'], ['F01.752.747.792.110', 'F02.463.593.112'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['F02.463.785.626'], ['F01.100.150.750.500', 'F01.145.488.887.500', 'N05.300.150.800.500'], ['F04.096.628'], ['F04.711.780'], ['F01.470.483.666'], ['E05.318.308.980', 'N05.715.360.300.800', 'N06.850.520.308.980'], ['E01.789.800', 'N04.761.559.590.800', 'N05.715.360.575.575.800']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0

Functional recovery and axonal growth following spinal cord transection is accelerated by sustained L-DOPA administration.,"The eel, Anguilla anguilla, as with other fish species, recovers well from spinal cord injury. We assessed the quality of locomotion of spinally transected eels from measurements made from video recordings of individuals swimming at different speeds in a water tunnel. Following transection of the spinal cord just caudal to the anus, the animals displayed higher tail beat frequencies and lower tail beat amplitudes than before surgery, owing to the loss of power in this region. Swimming performance then progressively recovered, appearing normal within 1 month of surgery. Eels with similar transections, but given regular, repeated intraperitoneal injections (50 mg/kg) of l-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA) showed an equivalent pattern of decline and recovery that was 10-20 days shorter than that seen in non-treated fish. Axonal growth into the denervated cord, as determined from anterograde labelling experiments, was also more rapid in the drug-treated fish. L-DOPA treatment increased the activity of all fish for up to 18 h, and accelerated the spontaneous movements ('spinal swimming') made by the denervated, caudal portion of the animal that appeared following transection. We suggest that this enhancement of locomotion underlies the accelerated axonal growth and, hence, functional recovery.","['Anguilla', 'Animals', 'Axons', 'Growth Cones', 'Levodopa', 'Motor Activity', 'Recovery of Function', 'Spinal Cord Injuries']",15450079,"[['B01.050.150.900.493.338.282'], ['B01.050'], ['A08.675.542.145', 'A11.284.180.075', 'A11.671.137', 'A11.671.501.145'], ['A11.284.180.075.249', 'A11.284.180.225.340', 'A11.284.180.610.345', 'A11.671.137.340', 'A11.671.240.340'], ['D02.092.311.200.480', 'D02.455.426.559.389.657.166.175.200.480', 'D12.125.072.050.685.400.500', 'D12.125.072.050.875.130.500'], ['F01.145.632', 'G11.427.410.698'], ['G16.757'], ['C10.228.854.763', 'C10.900.850', 'C26.819']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Diseases [C]']",1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Captopril in congestive heart failure: improved left ventricular function with decreased metabolic cost.,"The oral angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril (CPT) produces beneficial hemodynamic and clinical responses in patients with chronic congestive heart failure (CHF). Cardiac output and stroke volume increase, along with a decrease in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, indicating improved left ventricular function. During maintenance CPT therapy, the beneficial hemodynamic and clinical effects appear to be sustained. Improved left ventricular pump function with CPT is associated with decreased metabolic cost, as myocardial oxygen consumption consistently decreases in proportion to the decrease in myocardial oxygen demand. Myocardial ischemia occurs infrequently, as is evident from the abnormal myocardial lactate metabolism. Hypotension appears to be the major adverse effect, particularly after the first dose. However, with dose titration and the use of a smaller initial dose, a marked precipitous fall in blood pressure can be avoided in the majority of patients. Thus, CPT may prove to be a useful agent in the vasodilator therapy of chronic CHF.","['Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors', 'Captopril', 'Heart Failure', 'Heart Ventricles', 'Hemodynamics', 'Humans', 'Hydralazine', 'Hypotension', 'Myocardium', 'Oxygen Consumption', 'Prazosin', 'Proline', 'Vasodilator Agents']",6291359,"[['D27.505.519.389.745.085'], ['D12.125.072.401.623.270'], ['C14.280.434'], ['A07.541.560'], ['G09.330.380'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D03.383.710.605.500'], ['C14.907.514'], ['A02.633.580', 'A07.541.704', 'A10.690.552.750'], ['G03.680'], ['D03.633.100.786.750'], ['D12.125.072.401.623'], ['D27.505.954.411.918']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]']",1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Thoracoscopy versus thoracotomy: a prospective comparison of trauma and quality of life.,"BACKGROUND: Reliable comparisons of thoracoscopy (TCC) and anterolateral thoracotomy (ATT) with regard to trauma and post-operative quality of life are rare. This study was conducted to quantify the results of TCC, which was expected to show an advantage.METHODS: Using a matched-pair design (matching criteria: comparable intracavitary procedure, benign/malignant disease and sex), 22 patients were compared who underwent either TCC or ATT (Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-ranks test, P<0.05).RESULTS: Incision and operation time were shorter for TCC (TCC 5.3 vs ATT 23.7 cm, P=0.003; TCC 64 vs ATT 87 min, P=0.029). Differences in favor of TCC were detected for interleukin 6 (IL6) (TCC 17.2 vs ATT 105.6 pg/ml, P=0.036) in the immediate postoperative period, C-reactive protein (CRP) (TCC 28.2 vs ATT 86.6 mg/l; P=0.010) on the day 1 after the operation, forced vital capacity (FVC) (TCC 2.5 vs ATT 1.5 l, P=0.0173), elevation of the arm (EA) (TCC 143 vs ATT 109; P=0,026), pain on coughing (CP) (TCC 2.5 vs ATT 6.9 patients; P=0.009) and Spitzer Index (SI) (TCC 9.2 vs ATT 7,1 patients; P=0.009), as well as CP (TCC 1.4 vs ATT 4.4 patients; P=0,005) on day 4 after the operation.

Biomaterial scaffolds in cartilage-subchondral bone defects influencing the repair of autologous articular cartilage transplants.,"The repair of articular cartilage typically involves the repair of cartilage-subchondral bone tissue defects. Although various bioactive materials have been used to repair bone defects, how these bioactive materials in subchondral bone defects influence the repair of autologous cartilage transplant remains unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of different subchondral biomaterial scaffolds on the repair of autologous cartilage transplant in a sheep model. Cylindrical cartilage-subchondral bone defects were created in the right femoral knee joint of each sheep. The subchondral bone defects were implanted with hydroxyapatite-â-tricalcium phosphate (HA-TCP), poly lactic-glycolic acid (PLGA)-HA-TCP dual-layered composite scaffolds (PLGA/HA-TCP scaffolds), or autologous bone chips. The autologous cartilage layer was placed on top of the subchondral materials. After 3 months, the effect of different subchondral scaffolds on the repair of autologous cartilage transplant was systematically studied by investigating the mechanical strength, structural integration, and histological responses. The results showed that the transplanted cartilage layer supported by HA-TCP scaffolds had better structural integration and higher mechanical strength than that supported by PLGA/HA-TCP scaffolds. Furthermore, HA-TCP-supported cartilage showed higher expression of acid mucosubstances and glycol-amino-glycan contents than that supported by PLGA/HA-TCP scaffolds. Our results suggested that the physicochemical properties, including the inherent mechanical strength and material chemistry of the scaffolds, play important roles in influencing the repair of autologous cartilage transplants. The study may provide useful information for the design and selection of proper subchondral biomaterials to support the repair of both subchondral bone and cartilage defects.","['Alkaline Phosphatase', 'Animals', 'Biocompatible Materials', 'Biomechanical Phenomena', 'Bone Substitutes', 'Cartilage, Articular', 'Hyaline Cartilage', 'Hydroxyapatites', 'Lactic Acid', 'Materials Testing', 'Polyglycolic Acid', 'Polylactic Acid-Polyglycolic Acid Copolymer', 'Sheep', 'Tissue Scaffolds', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A']",22684516,"[['D08.811.277.352.650.035'], ['B01.050'], ['D25.130', 'D27.720.102.130', 'J01.637.051.130'], ['G01.154.090', 'G01.374.089'], ['D25.130.325', 'J01.637.051.130.325'], ['A02.165.407.150', 'A02.835.583.192'], ['A02.165.407', 'A10.165.382.400'], ['D01.029.260.700.675.374.075.025.300', 'D01.146.360.050.300', 'D01.578.122.477', 'D01.695.625.675.650.075.025.300'], ['D02.241.511.459.450'], ['E05.570'], ['D05.750.728.780', 'D25.720.728.780', 'J01.637.051.720.728.780'], ['D02.241.511.459.450.500', 'D05.750.728.780.500', 'D25.720.728.780.500', 'J01.637.051.720.728.780.500'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.500.380.791'], ['E07.206.627', 'E07.695.825'], ['E04.936.664'], ['D12.644.276.100.800.200', 'D12.776.467.100.800.200', 'D23.529.100.800.200']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
Seeing the forest through the trees: a comparison of different IAT variants measuring implicit alcohol associations.,"Dual-process models propose that addictive behaviors are determined by an implicit, impulsive system and an explicit, reflective system. Consistent with these models, research has demonstrated implicit affective associations with alcohol, using the Implicit Association Test (IAT), that predict unique variance in drinking behavior above explicit cognitions. However, different IAT versions have been used to measure implicit affective associations with alcohol, and the present study sought to determine which of these IAT variants showed the highest validity and internal consistencies. In total, 4800 participants completed one of six IAT versions via the Internet: a bipolar IAT (i.e., positive vs. negative), a unipolar positive IAT (i.e., positive vs. neutral), or a unipolar negative IAT (i.e., negative vs. neutral) with general positive and negative stimuli or with positive and negative alcohol-related affective states. While the alcohol-related affective bipolar and unipolar positive IAT versions and the general affective bipolar and unipolar positive IAT versions showed comparable internal consistencies, somewhat lower internal consistencies were found for the unipolar negative IAT versions. Further, alcohol-related affective IAT variants were more strongly related to explicit measures than general affective IAT versions. Also, alcohol-related and general affective bipolar and unipolar positive IAT variants were related to drinking behavior, but not unipolar negative IAT variants.

Application of recurrent neural network for online prediction of cell density of recombinant Pichia pastoris producing HBsAg.,"Artificial neural networking (ANN) seems to be a promising soft sensor for implementing current approaches of quality by design (QbD) and process analytical technologies (PAT) in the biopharmaceutical industry. In this study, we aimed to implement best-fitted ANN architecture for online prediction of the biomass amount of recombinant Pichia pastoris (P. pastoris) - expressing intracellular hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) - during the fed-batch fermentation process using methanol as a sole carbon source. For this purpose, at the induction phase of methanol fed-batch fermentation, carbon evolution rate (CER), dissolved oxygen (DO), and methanol feed rate were selected as input vectors and total wet cell weight (WCW) was considered as output vector for the ANN. The obtained results indicated that after training recurrent ANN with data sets of four fed-batch runs, this toolbox could predict the WCW of the next fed-batch fermentation process at each specified time point with high accuracy. The R-squared and root-mean-square error between actual and predicted values were found to be 0.9985 and 13.73, respectively. This verified toolbox could have major importance in the biopharmaceutical industry since recombinant P. pastoris is widely used for the large-scale production of HBsAg.","['Bacterial Load', 'Biomass', 'Bioreactors', 'Fermentation', 'Hepatitis B Surface Antigens', 'Hepatitis B virus', 'Methanol', 'Neural Networks, Computer', 'Pichia', 'Recombinant Proteins']",30707051,"[['E01.370.225.875.150.115', 'E01.370.225.875.220.115', 'E05.200.875.150.115', 'E05.200.875.220.115', 'G06.099.100'], ['G16.500.275.157.100', 'N06.230.124.100'], ['E07.115', 'J01.897.120.115'], ['G02.111.158.249', 'G03.191.249'], ['D23.050.327.495.500.475'], ['B04.280.375.650.425', 'B04.450.390.650.425'], ['D02.033.623'], ['G17.485', 'L01.224.050.375.605'], ['B01.300.107.795.700', 'B01.300.930.600'], ['D12.776.828']]","['Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Information Science [L]']",0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0
Hepatic arterial infusion enhances DOTATOC radiopeptide therapy in patients with neuroendocrine liver metastases.,"Intravenously administered radiolabeled peptides targeting somatostatin receptors are used for the treatment of unresectable gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (GEP-NETs). Recently, we demonstrated a high first-pass effect during intra-arterial (i.a.) administration of positron emission tomography (PET) labeled (68)Ga-DOTA(0)-d-Phe(1)-Tyr(3)-octreotide (DOTATOC). In this pilot study, we investigated the therapeutic effectiveness of arterial administered DOTATOC, labeled with the therapeutic â emitters (90)Y and (177)Lu. (90)Y- and/or (177)Lu-DOTATOC were infused into the hepatic artery of 15 patients with liver metastases arising from GEP-NETs. Response was assessed using DOTATOC-PET, multiphase contrast enhanced computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and the serum tumor marker chromogranin A. Pharmacokinetic data of the arterial approach were assessed using (111)In-DOTATOC scans. With the treatment regime of this pilot study, complete remission was achieved in one (7%) patient and partial remission was observed in eight (53%) patients, six patients were classified as stable (40%; response evaluation criteria in solid tumors criteria). The concomitant decrease of elevated serum tumor marker confirmed the radiologic response. Median time to progression was not reached within a mean follow-up period of 20 months. Receptor saturation and redistribution effects were identified as limiting factors for i.a. DOTATOC therapy. The high rate of objective radiologic response in NET patients treated with arterial infusion of (90)Y-/(177)Lu-DOTATOC compares favorably with systemic chemotherapy and intravenous radiopeptide therapy. While i.a. DOTATOC therapy is only applicable to patients with tumors of limited anatomic distribution, the results of this pilot study are a promising development in the treatment of GEP-NET and warrants further investigation of this novel approach.","['Adult', 'Aged', 'Chromogranin A', 'Female', 'Hepatic Artery', 'Humans', 'Infusions, Intra-Arterial', 'Liver Neoplasms', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neuroendocrine Tumors', 'Octreotide', 'Pancreatic Neoplasms', 'Pilot Projects', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Radiopharmaceuticals', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed', 'Yttrium Radioisotopes']",21791571,"[['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['D12.776.631.199.249'], ['A07.015.114.407'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E02.319.267.510.520'], ['C04.588.274.623', 'C06.301.623', 'C06.552.697'], ['E01.370.350.825.500'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['C04.557.465.625.650', 'C04.557.580.625.650'], ['D04.345.566.650', 'D12.644.641.650'], ['C04.588.274.761', 'C04.588.322.475', 'C06.301.761', 'C06.689.667', 'C19.344.421'], ['E05.318.372.750', 'E05.337.737', 'N05.715.360.330.720', 'N06.850.520.450.720'], ['E01.370.350.350.800.700', 'E01.370.350.600.350.800.399', 'E01.370.350.710.800.399', 'E01.370.350.825.800.399', 'E01.370.384.730.800.399'], ['D27.505.259.843', 'D27.505.519.871', 'D27.720.470.410.650'], ['E01.370.350.350.810', 'E01.370.350.600.350.700.810', 'E01.370.350.700.700.810', 'E01.370.350.700.810.810', 'E01.370.350.825.810.810'], ['D01.268.558.975.500.800', 'D01.268.956.890.500.800', 'D01.496.749.960', 'D01.496.943.800', 'D01.552.550.975.500.800']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Health Care [N]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
"Williamsia spongiae sp. nov., an actinomycete isolated from the marine sponge Amphimedon viridis.","A novel actinobacterium, designated isolate B138T, was isolated from the marine sponge, Amphimedon viridis, which was collected from Praia Guaec? (S?o Paulo, Brazil), and its taxonomic position was established using data from a polyphasic study. The organism showed a combination of chemotaxonomic and morphological characteristics consistent with its classification in the genus Williamsia and it formed a distinct phyletic line in the Williamsia 16S rRNA gene tree. It was most closely related to Williamsia serinedens DSM 45037T and Williamsia deligens DSM 44902T (99.0 % 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity) and Williamsia maris DSM 44693T (97.5 % 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity), but was distinguished readily from these strains by the low DNA-DNA relatedness values (62.3-64.4 %) and by the discriminatory phenotypic properties. Based on the data obtained, the isolate B138T (=CBMAI 1094T=DSM 46676T) should be classified as the type strain of a novel species of the genus Williamsia, for which the name Williamsia spongiae sp. nov. is proposed.","['Actinomycetales', 'Animals', 'Bacterial Typing Techniques', 'Base Composition', 'Brazil', 'DNA, Bacterial', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'Phylogeny', 'Porifera', 'RNA, Ribosomal, 16S', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA']",28100308,"[['B03.510.024.049'], ['B01.050'], ['E01.370.225.875.150.125', 'E05.200.875.150.125'], ['G02.111.080'], ['Z01.107.757.176'], ['D13.444.308.212'], ['E05.393.661', 'G02.111.611'], ['G05.697', 'G16.075.605', 'L01.100.697'], ['B01.050.500.802'], ['D13.444.735.686.670'], ['E05.393.760.700']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Information Science [L]']",0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1
Phosphatidylserine increases IKBKAP levels in a humanized knock-in IKBKAP mouse model.,"Familial dysautonomia (FD) is a severe neurodegenerative genetic disorder restricted to the Ashkenazi Jewish population. The most common mutation in FD patients is a T-to-C transition at position 6 of intron 20 of the IKBKAP gene. This mutation causes aberrant skipping of exon 20 in a tissue-specific manner, leading to reduction of the IêB kinase complex-associated protein (IKAP) protein in the nervous system. We established a homozygous humanized mouse strain carrying human exon 20 and its two flanking introns; the 3' intron has the transition observed in the IKBKAP gene of FD patients. Although our FD humanized mouse does not display FD symptoms, the unique, tissue-specific splicing pattern of the IKBKAP in these mice allowed us to evaluate the effect of therapies on gene expression and exon 20 splicing. The FD mice were supplemented with phosphatidylserine (PS), a safe food supplement that increases mRNA and protein levels of IKBKAP in cell lines generated from FD patients. Here we demonstrated that PS treatment increases IKBAKP mRNA and IKAP protein levels in various tissues of FD mice without affecting exon 20 inclusion levels. We also observed that genes associated with transcription regulation and developmental processes were up-regulated in the cerebrum of PS-treated mice. Thus, PS holds promise for the treatment of FD.","['Alternative Splicing', 'Animals', 'Carrier Proteins', 'Cell Line', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Dysautonomia, Familial', 'Exons', 'Female', 'Gene Knock-In Techniques', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Introns', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Phosphatidylserines', 'Transcriptional Elongation Factors']",23515154,"[['G02.111.760.700.100', 'G03.839.700.100', 'G05.308.700.700.100'], ['B01.050'], ['D12.776.157'], ['A11.251.210'], ['C22.232', 'E05.598.500', 'E05.599.395.080'], ['C10.177.575.300', 'C10.500.250.309', 'C10.574.500.493.250', 'C10.668.829.800.175.250', 'C16.131.666.310.309', 'C16.320.400.415.309'], ['G05.360.340.024.340.137.232'], ['E05.393.335.249'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D12.644.360', 'D12.776.476'], ['G05.360.340.024.220.400', 'G05.360.340.024.340.137.515'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500'], ['B01.050.050.136.500', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500.800'], ['D10.570.755.375.760.400.971'], ['D12.776.930.955']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Growth of non-phototrophic microorganisms using solar energy through mineral photocatalysis.,"Phototrophy and chemotrophy are two dominant modes of microbial metabolism. To date, non-phototrophic microorganisms have been excluded from the solar light-centered phototrophic metabolism. Here we report a pathway that demonstrates a role of light in non-phototrophic microbial activity. In lab simulations, visible light-excited photoelectrons from metal oxide, metal sulfide, and iron oxide stimulated the growth of chemoautotrophic and heterotrophic bacteria. The measured bacterial growth was dependent on light wavelength and intensity, and the growth pattern matched the light absorption spectra of the minerals. The photon-to-biomass conversion efficiency was in the range of 0.13-1.90‰. Similar observations were obtained in a natural soil sample containing both bacteria and semiconducting minerals. Results from this study provide evidence for a newly identified, but possibly long-existing pathway, in which the metabolisms and growth of non-phototrophic bacteria can be stimulated by solar light through photocatalysis of semiconducting minerals.","['Acidithiobacillus', 'Alcaligenes faecalis', 'Bacteria', 'Bioelectric Energy Sources', 'Biomass', 'Minerals', 'Phototrophic Processes', 'Solar Energy', 'Sunlight']",22473012,"[['B03.440.400.425.103', 'B03.660.250.015'], ['B03.440.400.425.115.050.200', 'B03.660.075.090.344.050.200'], ['B03'], ['E07.305.124.150'], ['G16.500.275.157.100', 'N06.230.124.100'], ['D01.578'], ['G02.111.669', 'G03.800'], ['G01.750.897', 'N06.230.132.644.500'], ['G01.358.500.505.650.836', 'G01.750.250.650.836', 'G01.750.770.578.836', 'G16.500.275.063.725.525', 'G16.500.750.775.525', 'N06.230.300.100.725.525']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]']",0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
Hepatic glycogen depletion in fed female rats induced by piroxicam.,"The effects of i.p. piroxicam administration on hepatic glycogen levels and enzymatic activities of key enzymes involved into glycogen metabolism in fed female rats were studied. Liver glycogen concentrations in treated rats decreased with increasing time of treatment and doses of piroxicam administered. The fall in glycogen caused by piroxicam persisted for several days after it was discontinued. Neither nadolol nor phenobarbital administration were able to prevent the depleting effect of piroxicam. In the treated rats, glucose-6-phosphatase, glycogen phosphorylase and glycogen synthase activities remained unchanged respect to control. Also, proportion of phosphorylase in the active (a) form was not significantly affected by successive piroxicam daily doses. In contrast, we demonstrated a decrease in the glycogen synthase in the active I form. This reduction was time-dependent on piroxicam treatment. Further, glucose loads were not capable to restore activity in the synthase enzyme and liver glycogen synthesis in animals treated with piroxicam. The impairment into glycogen metabolism produced by piroxicam administration suggests liver becomes unable to maintain glucose homeostasis. Furthermore, glycogen depletion might produce an impairment in the metabolism of drugs administered simultaneously with piroxicam, because biotransformation of xenobiotics is a process depending on glycogen storage in the liver cells.","['Animals', 'Body Weight', 'Female', 'Glucose-6-Phosphatase', 'Glycogen Synthase', 'Liver Glycogen', 'Nadolol', 'Phenobarbital', 'Phosphorylases', 'Piroxicam', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar']",1338186,"[['B01.050'], ['C23.888.144', 'E01.370.600.115.100.160.120', 'E05.041.124.160.750', 'G07.100.100.160.120', 'G07.345.249.314.120'], ['D08.811.277.352.650.225'], ['D08.811.913.400.450.460.375'], ['D05.750.078.562.388.518', 'D09.698.365.388.518'], ['D02.033.100.624.698.601', 'D02.033.755.624.698.601', 'D02.092.063.624.698.601'], ['D03.383.742.698.253.650'], ['D08.811.913.400.450.460.400'], ['D02.886.665.500', 'D03.383.855.500'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700.900']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Laser capsulorrhaphy for multidirectional instability of the shoulder. An outcomes study and proposed classification system.,"BACKGROUND: Clinical data on the efficacy of laser capsulorrhaphy for the treatment of multidirectional instability of the shoulder are limited.HYPOTHESIS: The diagnosis of multidirectional instability includes a spectrum of pathologic symptoms that warrants subclassification; laser capsulorrhaphy alone is not uniformly effective for all subtypes.STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective review of prospectively collected data.METHODS: Twenty-five shoulders in 21 patients were treated with laser capsulorrhaphy for multidirectional instability. Functional outcomes at a mean duration of 32 months' follow-up (range, 24 to 48 months) were recorded.RESULTS: Instability recurred in 60% of patients with congenital multidirectional instability, 17% of patients with acquired multidirectional instability, and 33% of patients with posttraumatic multidirectional instability (overall recurrence rate, 40%). Generalized ligamentous laxity was a risk factor for recurrence. Patient satisfaction rates were 40%, 83%, and 22% for the congenital, acquired, and posttraumatic subgroups. Reasons for dissatisfaction included recurrent instability, persistent pain, and inability to return to athletic activity at desired capacity. The overall mean postoperative Simple Shoulder Test score was 84%. The mean postoperative numeric rating score for pain was 3.3 (10-point scale).CONCLUSIONS: Laser capsulorrhaphy may be effective for patients with acquired multidirectional instability secondary to repetitive microtrauma but is less predictable in the other subgroups.","['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Chi-Square Distribution', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Joint Capsule', 'Joint Dislocations', 'Joint Instability', 'Laser Therapy', 'Logistic Models', 'Male', 'Pain', 'Patient Satisfaction', 'Recovery of Function', 'Recurrence', 'Reoperation', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Shoulder Joint', 'Sports', 'Treatment Outcome']",12531753,"[['M01.060.057'], ['M01.060.116'], ['E05.318.740.994.300', 'G17.820.300', 'N05.715.360.750.750.200', 'N06.850.520.830.994.300'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['A02.835.583.443'], ['C05.550.518', 'C26.289'], ['C05.550.521'], ['E02.594', 'E04.014.520'], ['E05.318.740.500.525', 'E05.318.740.600.800.450', 'E05.318.740.750.450', 'E05.599.835.875', 'N05.715.360.750.530.480', 'N05.715.360.750.625.700.450', 'N05.715.360.750.695.470', 'N06.850.520.830.500.525', 'N06.850.520.830.600.800.450', 'N06.850.520.830.750.450'], ['C23.888.592.612', 'F02.830.816.444', 'G11.561.790.444'], ['F01.100.150.750.625', 'F01.145.488.887.625', 'N04.452.822.700', 'N05.300.150.800.625', 'N05.715.360.600'], ['G16.757'], ['C23.550.291.937'], ['E04.690'], ['E05.318.372.500.500.500', 'E05.318.372.500.750.750', 'N05.715.360.330.500.500.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.825', 'N06.850.520.450.500.500.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.825'], ['E05.318.740.600.800.725', 'N05.715.350.200.700', 'N05.715.360.750.625.700.700', 'N06.850.490.625.750', 'N06.850.520.830.600.800.725'], ['A02.835.583.748'], ['I03.450.642.845'], ['E01.789.800', 'N04.761.559.590.800', 'N05.715.360.575.575.800']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]']",1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0
A cautionary note concerning the use of stabilized weights in marginal structural models.,"Marginal structural models are commonly used to estimate the causal effect of a time-varying treatment in presence of time-dependent confounding. When fitting an MSM to data, the analyst must specify both the structural model for the outcome and the treatment models for the inverse-probability-of-treatment weights. The use of stabilized weights is recommended because they are generally less variable than the standard weights. In this paper, we are concerned with the use of the common stabilized weights when the structural model is specified to only consider partial treatment history, such as the current or most recent treatments. We present various examples of settings where these stabilized weights yield biased inferences while the standard weights do not. These issues are first investigated on the basis of simulated data and subsequently exemplified using data from the Honolulu Heart Program. Unlike common stabilized weights, we find that basic stabilized weights offer some protection against bias in structural models designed to estimate current or most recent treatment effects.","['Bias', 'Biostatistics', 'Blood Pressure', 'Causality', 'Computer Simulation', 'Confounding Factors, Epidemiologic', 'Humans', 'Models, Statistical', 'Motor Activity', 'Observational Studies as Topic']",25410264,"[['N05.715.350.150', 'N06.850.490.500'], ['E05.318.740.237'], ['E01.370.600.875.249', 'G09.330.380.076'], ['N05.715.350.200', 'N06.850.490.625'], ['L01.224.160'], ['N05.715.350.240', 'N06.850.490.718'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E05.318.740.500', 'E05.599.835', 'N05.715.360.750.530', 'N06.850.520.830.500'], ['F01.145.632', 'G11.427.410.698'], ['E05.318.372.250.500', 'N05.715.360.330.250.500', 'N06.850.520.450.250.500']]","['Health Care [N]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]']",0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0
Molecular imaging of reductive coupling reactions: interstitial-mediated coupling of benzaldehyde on reduced TiO2(110).,"We report the first visualization of a reactive intermediate formed from coupling two molecules on a surface-a diolate formed from benzaldehyde coupling on TiO(2)(110). The diolate, imaged using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), is reduced to gaseous stilbene upon heating to ?400 K, leaving behind two oxygen atoms that react with reduced Ti interstitials that migrate to the surface, contrary to the popular expectation that strong bonds in oxygenated molecules react only with oxygen vacancies at the surface. Our work further provides both experimental and theoretical evidence that Ti interstitials drive the formation of diolate intermediates. Initially mobile monomers migrate together to form paired features, identified as diolates that bond over two adjacent five-coordiante Ti atoms on the surface. Our work is of broad importance because it demonstrates the possibility of imaging the distribution and bonding configurations of reactant species on a molecular scale, which is a critical part of understanding surface reactions and the development of surface morphology during the course of reaction.","['Adsorption', 'Benzaldehydes', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Microscopy, Scanning Tunneling', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Nanostructures', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Surface Properties', 'Temperature', 'Titanium']",21229961,"[['G01.030', 'G02.020'], ['D02.047.222'], ['E05.318.372.550', 'E05.337.675', 'N05.715.360.330.550', 'N06.850.520.450.550'], ['E01.370.350.515.666.500', 'E05.595.666.500'], ['E05.599.595'], ['G02.111.570.820'], ['J01.637.512'], ['G02.700', 'G03.295.531'], ['G02.860'], ['G01.906.595', 'G16.500.275.063.725.710', 'G16.500.750.775.710', 'N06.230.150.450', 'N06.230.300.100.725.710'], ['D01.268.557.800', 'D01.268.956.878', 'D01.552.547.800']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]']",0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0

High-throughput cell-based screening of 4910 known drugs and drug-like small molecules identifies disulfiram as an inhibitor of prostate cancer cell growth.,"PURPOSE: To identify novel therapeutic opportunities for patients with prostate cancer, we applied high-throughput screening to systematically explore most currently marketed drugs and drug-like molecules for their efficacy against a panel of prostate cancer cells.EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We carried out a high-throughput cell-based screening with proliferation as a primary end-point using a library of 4,910 drug-like small molecule compounds in four prostate cancer (VCaP, LNCaP, DU 145, and PC-3) and two nonmalignant prostate epithelial cell lines (RWPE-1 and EP156T). The EC(50) values were determined for each cell type to identify cancer selective compounds. The in vivo effect of disulfiram (DSF) was studied in VCaP cell xenografts, and gene microarray and combinatorial studies with copper or zinc were done in vitro for mechanistic exploration.RESULTS: Most of the effective compounds, including antineoplastic agents, were nonselective and found to inhibit both cancer and control cells in equal amounts. In contrast, histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A, thiram, DSF, and monensin were identified as selective antineoplastic agents that inhibited VCaP and LNCaP cell proliferation at nanomolar concentrations. DSF reduced tumor growth in vivo, induced metallothionein expression, and reduced DNA replication by downregulating MCM mRNA expression. The effect of DSF was potentiated by copper in vitro.CONCLUSIONS: We identified three novel cancer-selective growth inhibitory compounds for human prostate cancer cells among marketed drugs. We then validated DSF as a potential prostate cancer therapeutic agent. These kinds of pharmacologically well-known molecules can be readily translated to in vivo preclinical studies and clinical trials.","['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Carcinoma', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Disulfiram', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'High-Throughput Screening Assays', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Models, Biological', 'Prostatic Neoplasms', 'Small Molecule Libraries', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",19789329,"[['B01.050'], ['D27.505.954.248'], ['C04.557.470.200'], ['G04.161.750', 'G07.345.249.410.750'], ['A11.251'], ['D02.241.081.251.869.220.250', 'D02.886.520.150.175', 'D02.886.706.200.200'], ['E01.370.225.500.388', 'E05.200.500.388', 'E05.242.417', 'E05.337.550.200'], ['E05.916.680'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500.550.500'], ['E05.599.395'], ['C04.588.945.440.770', 'C12.294.260.750', 'C12.294.565.625', 'C12.758.409.750'], ['D27.720.470.765'], ['E05.337.550.200.900', 'E05.624.850']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Effects of the protein kinase C inhibitor H-7 and calmodulin antagonist W-7 on superoxide production in growing and resting human histiocytic leukemia cells (U937).,"Serum, phorbol 12,13-didecanoate (PDD) and 1-oleoyl-2-acetoy-sn-glycerol (OAG) stimulated O2- release in human histiocytic leukemia U937 cells. The kinetics of O2- release caused by PDD but not by serum or OAG in growing cells differed from those in resting cells. Both the protein kinase C inhibitor 1-(5-isoquinolinylsulfonyl) 2-methylpiperidine (H-7) and calmodulin antagonist N-(6-aminohexyl)-5-chloro-1-naphthalenesulfonamide (W-7) reduced the superoxide generation induced by these stimuli. H-7 inhibited the O2- release either from growing or resting cells but the effect of W-7 varied according to the growth phase. From these results, it is suggested that activation of protein kinase C and calmodulin-dependent process has an important role in O2(-)-release induced by serum, OAG and PDD, and that the mechanism for PDD-induced O2(-)-release is different in growing and resting cells.","['1-(5-Isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-Methylpiperazine', 'Calmodulin', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line', 'Humans', 'Isoquinolines', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid', 'Piperazines', 'Protein Kinase C', 'Sulfonamides', 'Superoxides']",3034277,"[['D02.886.590.700.545', 'D03.383.606.527', 'D03.633.100.531.400'], ['D12.644.360.372.249', 'D12.776.157.125.412.249', 'D12.776.476.387.249'], ['G04.144.220', 'G04.161.750.500', 'G05.113', 'G07.345.249.410.750.500'], ['A11.251.210'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D03.633.100.531'], ['G01.374.661', 'G02.111.490'], ['C04.557.337.539'], ['D03.383.606'], ['D08.811.913.696.620.682.700.725'], ['D02.065.884', 'D02.886.590.700'], ['D01.248.497.158.685.750.850', 'D01.339.431.374.850', 'D01.650.550.750.800', 'D02.389.338.732']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]']",1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Deblurring.,"In most instances, traditional EEG methodology provides insufficient spatial detail to identify relationships between brain electrical events and structures and functions visualized by magnetic resonance imaging or positron emission tomography. This article describes a method called Deblurring for increasing the spatial detail of the EEG and for fusing neurophysiologic and neuroanatomic data. Deblurring estimates potentials near the outer convexity of the cortex using a realistic finite element model of the structure of a subject's head determined from their magnetic resonance images. Deblurring is not a source localization technique and thus makes no assumptions about the number or type of generator sources. The validity of Deblurring has been initially tested by comparing deblurred data with potentials measured with subdural grid recordings. Results suggest that deblurred topographic maps, registered with a subject's magnetic resonance imaging and rendered in three dimensions, provide better spatial detail than has heretofore been obtained with scalp EEG recordings. Example results are presented from research studies of somatosensory stimulation, movement, language, attention and working memory. Deblurred ictal EEG data are also presented, indicating that this technique may have future clinical application as an aid to seizure localization and surgical planning.","['Brain', 'Cognition', 'Electroencephalography', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Male', 'Memory', 'Mental Processes', 'Pattern Recognition, Visual', 'Reading']",10426404,"[['A08.186.211'], ['F02.463.188'], ['E01.370.376.300', 'E01.370.405.245'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E01.370.350.825.500'], ['F02.463.425.540'], ['F02.463'], ['F02.463.593.524.500', 'F02.463.593.932.622'], ['L01.559.423.557']]","['Anatomy [A]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Information Science [L]']",1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
"Retinal oxidation, apoptosis and age- and sex-differences in the mnd mutant mouse, a model of neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis.","Retinal degeneration is an early and progressive event in many forms of neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCLs), a heterogeneous group of neurodegenerative disorders with unknown pathogenesis. We here used the mutant motor neuron degeneration (mnd) mouse, a late-infantile NCL variant, to investigate the retinal oxidative state and apoptotic cell death as a function of age and sex. Total superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities and thiobarbituric acid-reactive substance (TBARS) levels revealed progressive increases in retinal oxyradicals and lipid peroxides of mnd mice of both sexes. Female mnd retinas showed a higher oxidation rate and consistently exhibited the 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (4-HNE)-adducts staining and advanced histopathologic profile when compared to male mnd retinas matched for age. In situ DNA fragmentation (TUNEL staining) appeared in the outer nuclear layer (ONL) as early as 1 month of age. At 4 months, there were more intense and numerous TUNEL-positive cells in the same layer and in the inner nuclear (INL) and ganglion cell (GCL) layers; whereas at 8 months TUNEL staining was restricted to a few scattered cells in the INL and GCL, when a severe retinal cell loss had occurred. Caspase-3 activation confirmed apoptotic demise and its processing turned out to be higher in mnd females than males. These results demonstrate the involvement of oxidation and apoptotic processes in mnd mouse retinopathy and highlight sex-related differences in retinal vulnerability to oxidative stress and damage.","['Aldehydes', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspases', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Female', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'In Situ Nick-End Labeling', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Neurologic Mutants', 'Neuronal Ceroid-Lipofuscinoses', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Retina', 'Retinal Degeneration', 'Sex Factors', 'Superoxide Dismutase', 'Thiobarbituric Acid Reactive Substances']",15213005,"[['D02.047'], ['B01.050'], ['G04.146.954.035'], ['D08.811.277.656.262.500.126.350.300', 'D08.811.277.656.300.200.126.350.300', 'D12.644.360.075.405.350.300', 'D12.776.476.075.405.350.300'], ['D08.811.277.656.262.500.126', 'D08.811.277.656.300.200.126', 'D12.644.360.075.405', 'D12.776.476.075.405'], ['C22.232', 'E05.598.500', 'E05.599.395.080'], ['G02.111.263', 'G03.328'], ['E01.370.225.500.607.512', 'E01.370.225.750.551.512', 'E05.200.500.607.512', 'E05.200.750.551.512', 'E05.478.583', 'H01.158.100.656.234.512', 'H01.158.201.344.512', 'H01.158.201.486.512', 'H01.181.122.573.512', 'H01.181.122.605.512'], ['E05.393.475'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500'], ['B01.050.050.199.520.520.420', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500.400.420'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500.550.480'], ['C10.574.500.550', 'C16.320.400.600', 'C16.320.565.398.641.509', 'C18.452.584.687.509', 'C18.452.648.398.641.509'], ['G02.700', 'G03.295.531'], ['G03.673', 'G07.775.750'], ['A09.371.729'], ['C11.270.612', 'C11.768.585'], ['N05.715.350.675', 'N06.850.490.875'], ['D08.811.682.881'], ['D02.047.700.700', 'D27.720.470.410.750']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Health Care [N]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0
Healing the schism: medicine and public health in Pakistan.,"BACKGROUND: The relationship between medicine and public health has a long and complex co-evolution. In developing countries where the health needs are greatest and resources are few, this relationship is of critical importance.DEVELOPMENT OF MEDICINE AND PUBLIC HEALTH AT THE AGA KHAN UNIVERSITY: This paper provides a case study of the development of the relationship between medical and public health at the Aga Khan University (AKU), a leading educational institution in Pakistan, which was founded with a vision of reuniting medicine and public health. Rapid growth and development have led to successful medicine and public health programs, but have fallen short in creating the synergies needed to address the population health problems of the country.THE WAY FORWARD: In a twenty-five year history of strong growth and development, the AKU has recreated the schism that marked US institutional development in the 20th century, despite strategic consideration to address population health in the design of the University. We recommend the creation of public health schools that focus on leadership to renew an emphasis on unifying health concepts and actions following successful examples to bring medicine and public health together.","['Community Medicine', 'Delivery of Health Care', 'Education, Medical', 'Health Services Needs and Demand', 'Humans', 'Pakistan', 'Public Health']",19034838,"[['H02.403.220'], ['N04.590.374', 'N05.300'], ['I02.358.399'], ['N03.349.380.420', 'N05.300.450'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['Z01.252.245.723'], ['H02.403.720', 'N01.400.550', 'N06.850']]","['Disciplines and Occupations [H]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Geographicals [Z]']",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1
Predicting neuropsychological abnormalities in multiple sclerosis.,"Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is associated with MRI signal alteration and neuropsychological (NP) dysfunction. Screening tools have been developed to identify patients at high risk for these neurological complications of MS. One such measure, the Multiple Sclerosis Neuropsychological Screening Questionnaire (MSNQ), has well-established reliability and predictive validity. In this article, we report on the accumulated findings derived from 162 consecutive research participants and MS clinic attendees. Our data show significant correlation between both patient- and informant-report MSNQ and NP impairment. As shown previously, larger, and more significant correlations are found between informant-report MSNQs than with patient-report MSNQs. In addition, we find that the MSNQ predicts follow-up NP testing 51 weeks after baseline with a similar degree of association.

Role of ultrasound biomicroscopy in management of eyes with stage 5 retinopathy of prematurity.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: To assess the role of ultrasound biomicroscopy in the surgical management of eyes with stage 5 retinopathy of prematurity.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Ultrasound biomicroscopy was performed preoperatively in 18 eyes with stage 5 retinopathy of prematurity to view the access to the anterior surgical space.RESULTS: Of the 15 (83.3%) eyes with anterior open funnel on B-scan ultrasonography, only 8 (53.3%) eyes had open access to the anterior surgical space and were scheduled for lensectomy.CONCLUSION: Ultrasound biomicroscopy is an effective tool for assessing anterior surgical space and helps surgical decision making in vitreoretinal surgery in eyes with stage 5 retinopathy of prematurity.","['Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Microscopy, Acoustic', 'Monitoring, Intraoperative', 'Preoperative Period', 'Prospective Studies', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Retinopathy of Prematurity', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Vitrectomy']",20307037,"[['E05.318.372.500.750.249', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.350', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.350'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.703'], ['M01.060.703.520'], ['E01.370.350.515.370', 'E01.370.350.850.565', 'E05.595.370'], ['E01.370.520.510', 'E04.510'], ['E04.614.937', 'N02.421.585.753.937'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.625', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.650', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.650'], ['E05.318.370.725', 'E05.337.851', 'N05.715.360.325.685', 'N06.850.520.445.725'], ['C11.768.836', 'C16.614.521.731'], ['E05.318.308.980.438.475.456.500', 'N05.715.360.300.800.438.375.364.500', 'N06.850.520.308.980.438.475.364.500'], ['E04.540.960']]","['Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Diseases [C]']",0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
Functional analysis of the defective T cell regulation of the antigen-specific PFC response in SLE patients: differentiation of suppressor precursor cells to suppressor effector cells.,"The investigation described here is concerned with the T cell regulation of the antigen-specific antibody response which has been studied in patients suffering from systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Apart from the fact that T helper cell activity was found to be less efficient, it appeared that the peripheral blood leucocytes (PBL) of patients in an active stage of the disease did not contain the suppressor precursor cells, which functions as the target cell for the inductive signal of T mu+ suppressor inducer cells. The absence of the suppressor precursor cells in SLE patients coincided with the absence of T gamma+ suppressor effector cells. Characterization of the (post-thymic) precursor cells (derived from normal donors) with the aid of monoclonal antibodies of the OKT series and several other markers pointed out that this population contains OKT4+ as well as OKT8+ cells. Further experiments demonstrated that the cells are capable of rosetting with autologous erythrocytes, and do not bear Fc receptors for IgM or IgG. Considering the various findings as a whole the conclusion is warranted that the post-thymic suppressor precursor T cell can differentiate into a suppressor effector cell only after interaction with T suppressor inducer cells.","['Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antibody Formation', 'Antibody Specificity', 'Hemolytic Plaque Technique', 'Humans', 'Lupus Erythematosus, Systemic', 'Ovalbumin', 'Phenotype', 'T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory']",6210474,"[['D12.776.124.486.485.114.224', 'D12.776.124.790.651.114.224', 'D12.776.377.715.548.114.224'], ['G12.450.050.370.250'], ['G12.100'], ['E01.370.225.812.375', 'E05.200.812.375', 'E05.478.594.375'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C17.300.480', 'C20.111.590'], ['D12.644.861.557', 'D12.776.034.614', 'D12.776.256.159.157.663', 'D12.776.290.663', 'D12.776.872.557'], ['G05.695'], ['A11.118.637.555.567.550.500.700', 'A11.118.637.555.567.569.200.700', 'A11.118.637.555.567.569.500.700', 'A15.145.229.637.555.567.550.500.700', 'A15.145.229.637.555.567.569.200.700', 'A15.145.229.637.555.567.569.500.700', 'A15.382.490.555.567.550.500.700', 'A15.382.490.555.567.569.200.700', 'A15.382.490.555.567.569.500.700']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Circulating prostacyclin and thromboxane levels in patients with diabetic retinopathy.,"Prostacyclin (PGI2) is the most potent endogenous inhibitor of platelet aggregation yet discovered. Thromboxane (TXA2) promotes aggregation and degranulation of platelets. It is hypothesized that an homeostasis exists between these pathways that is protective against vascular damage and is disturbed in several diseases such as diabetes. Circulating levels of PGI2-TXA2 in 35 patients with adult onset diabetes and 15 controls have been assayed. Twenty patients had background retinopathy, and 15 had proliferative retinopathy. Circulating levels of PGI were found to be elevated in 9/15 patients with proliferative diabetic retinopathy, 2/20 diabetic patients with background or no retinopathy, and 0/15 controls. PGI levels may correlate, therefore, with the severity of the retinopathy.","['Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Epoprostenol', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prostaglandins', 'Thromboxane A2', 'Thromboxanes']",6750495,"[['C11.768.257', 'C14.907.320.382', 'C19.246.099.500.382'], ['D10.251.355.255.550.550.500', 'D23.469.050.175.725.550.500'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['D10.251.355.255.550', 'D23.469.050.175.725'], ['D10.251.355.255.100.825.800', 'D10.251.355.310.166.971.800'], ['D10.251.355.255.100.825', 'D10.251.355.310.166.971']]","['Diseases [C]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Named Groups [M]']",0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
The Tsukuba hypertensive mouse (transgenic mouse carrying human genes for both renin and angiotensinogen) as a model of human malignant hypertension: development of lesions and morphometric analysis.,"The renin-angiotensin system has a pivotal role in hypertension. The Tsukuba hypertensive mouse (THM; a transgenic mouse carrying human genes for both renin and angiotensinogen) was generated to allow further examination of the renin-angiotensin system in a variety of pathologic conditions. We evaluated the development of renal lesions in these mice and in controls by morphometric, immunohistochemical and ultrastructural methods. Blood pressure was significantly higher in THM than in control mice; 1 year after birth, it was approximately 40 mmHg higher. The kidney-to-body weight ratio was also higher in THM than in control. Morphometrical analysis revealed that the glomerular sclerosis index was significantly elevated in THM with 10% of the glomeruli sclerotic at 18 months. The grade of vascular lesion and the frequency of fibronoid arteritis of the kidney exhibited the same tendency as the glomerular sclerosis index. Murine renin was located exclusively in the juxtaglomerular apparatus, whereas human renin was expressed not only in the juxtaglomerular apparatus, but also in periarteriolar smooth muscle cells and in mesangial and epithelial cells of the glomeruli. Light and electron microscopy revealed significant fibrinoid arteritis of the kidney in THM and also ""onion skinning"", both pathognomonic for malignant nephrosclerosis. THM may be an excellent model of human malignant hypertension.","['Animals', 'Arteritis', 'Blood Pressure', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Endothelium', 'Female', 'Glomerulosclerosis, Focal Segmental', 'Humans', 'Hypertension', 'Juxtaglomerular Apparatus', 'Kidney Glomerulus', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Muscle, Smooth, Vascular', 'Renin-Angiotensin System']",9504863,"[['B01.050'], ['C14.907.940.090'], ['E01.370.600.875.249', 'G09.330.380.076'], ['C22.232', 'E05.598.500', 'E05.599.395.080'], ['A10.272.491'], ['C12.777.419.570.363.660', 'C13.351.968.419.570.363.640'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C14.907.489'], ['A05.810.453.324.359.520', 'A05.810.453.736.520.520'], ['A05.810.453.324.359', 'A05.810.453.736.520'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500'], ['B01.050.050.136.500', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500.800'], ['A02.633.570.491', 'A07.015.733.500', 'A10.690.467.491'], ['G03.820', 'G09.330.380.813']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Financial Toxicity of Cancer Care: It's Time to Intervene.,"Evidence suggests that a considerably large proportion of cancer patients are affected by treatment-related financial harm. As medical debt grows for some with cancer, the downstream effects can be catastrophic, with a recent study suggesting a link between extreme financial distress and worse mortality. At least three factors might explain the relationship between extreme financial distress and greater risk of mortality: 1) overall poorer well-being, 2) impaired health-related quality of life, and 3) sub-par quality of care. While research has described the financial harm associated with cancer treatment, little has been done to effectively intervene on the problem. Long-term solutions must focus on policy changes to reduce unsustainable drug prices and promote innovative insurance models. In the mean time, patients continue to struggle with high out-of-pocket costs. For more immediate solutions, we should look to the oncologist and patient. Oncologists should focus on the value of care delivered, encourage patient engagement on the topic of costs, and be better educated on financial resources available to patients. For their part, patients need improved cost-related health literacy so they are aware of potential costs and resources, and research should focus on how patients define high-value care. With a growing list of financial side effects induced by cancer treatment, the time has come to intervene on the ""financial toxicity"" of cancer care.","['Communication', 'Cost-Benefit Analysis', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Expenditures', 'Health Literacy', 'Humans', 'Insurance Coverage', 'Insurance, Health', 'Medicare', 'Neoplasms', 'Quality of Life', 'Stress, Psychological', 'United States']",26657334,"[['F01.145.209', 'L01.143'], ['N03.219.151.125'], ['N03.219.151.400', 'N05.300.375'], ['N03.219.151.450', 'N05.300.385'], ['I02.233.332.186.500', 'L01.143.450.500', 'N02.421.726.407.229.500'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['N03.219.521.576.265'], ['N03.219.521.576.343'], ['N03.219.521.346.506.564.663', 'N03.219.521.576.343.840', 'N03.706.615.696'], ['C04'], ['I01.800', 'K01.752.400.750', 'N06.850.505.400.425.837'], ['F01.145.126.990', 'F02.830.900'], ['Z01.107.567.875']]","['Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Humanities [K]', 'Geographicals [Z]']",0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,1
Significance of MTG8 in leukemogenesis.,"MTG8 is a counterpart gene of AML1 in acute myeloid leukemia with t(8:21) translocation. Most of the coding region of the MTG8 is fused with AML1 runt domain. In normal tissues, the MTG8 is highly expressed in brain, but not in hematopoietic tissues. MTG8 may be important in leukemogenesis as well as in AML1 truncation. The function of MTG8 is assumed to be as a transcription factor, because it possesses several features common to transcription factors; putative zinc finger motifs, serine/threonine/proline-rich sequences and a region similar to TAF110.

Protein kinase-C in the human fetal adrenal gland.,"The fetal zone (FZ) of the human fetal adrenal gland undergoes rapid growth and exhibits a high rate of steroidogenesis throughout fetal life. In addition to cAMP-dependent processes regulating steroidogenesis and possibly growth of the FZ, evidence is accumulating that cAMP-independent mechanisms are also involved. The purpose of this study was to determine if the phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), a potent stimulator of protein kinase-C activity, stimulates steroidogenesis in FZ cells and to characterize protein kinase-C activity in FZ, neocortex zone, and anencephalic adrenal tissues. Adrenal glands were obtained from first and second trimester abortions and two anencephalic fetuses. The FZ was dissected from the neocortex. In some experiments, dispersed FZ cells were incubated in the presence and absence of ACTH and TPA for 3 h. TPA and ACTH stimulated steroidogenesis 2- and 5-fold, respectively. In other experiments, the separated zones and anencephalic adrenal tissues were homogenized, and the homogenates were subjected to DEAE-cellulose column chromatography. A single peak with phospholipid- and calcium-dependent activity was found. Subcellular distribution studies demonstrated greatest activity in the cytosolic fraction. The specific activity of protein kinase-C was significantly greater in FZ than neocortex zone, whether expressed per mg protein or per microgram DNA content. The activity in anencephalic tissue was low. In addition, protein kinase-C (80,000-dalton molecular size protein) was detected in adrenal tissues after electrophoresis and immunoblotting using an antibody directed against protein kinase-C. Greater amounts of protein kinase-C were detected in FZ tissue than in NC or anencephalic adrenal tissue. These results indicate that the lower activities of protein kinase-C in neocortex and anencephalic adrenal tissues were due to low amounts of enzyme rather than inactive enzyme. In summary, TPA-stimulated steroidogenesis in fetal zone cells and fetal zone cells contained greater activity and a greater amount of protein kinase-C than neocortex cells. Minimal activity and enzyme protein were found in anencephalic tissues.

Arterial indices and serum cystatin C level in individuals with occupational wide band noise exposure.,"BACKGROUND: Chronic exposure to noise is known to cause a wide range of health problems including extracellular matrix (ECM) proliferation and involvement of cardiovascular system. There are a few studies to investigate noise-induced vascular changes using noninvasive methods. In this study we used carotid artery intima-media thickness (CIMT) and aortic augmentation as indices of arterial properties and cystatin C as a serum biomarker relating to ECM metabolism.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ninety-three male participants were included in this study from aeronautic technicians: 39 with and 54 without a history of wide band noise (WBN) exposure. For better discrimination, the participants were divided into the two age groups: <40 and >40 years old. Adjusted aortic augmentation index (AI) for a heart rate equal to 75 beats per minute (AIx@HR75) were calculated using pulse wave analysis (PWA). CIMT was measured in 54 participants who accepted to undergo Doppler ultrasonography. Serum cystatin C was also measured.RESULTS: Among younger individuals the mean CIMT was 0.85 ± 0.09 mm and 0.75 ± 0.22 mm in the in the exposed and the control groups respectively. Among older individuals CIMT had a mean of 1.04 ± 0.22 mm vs. 1.00 ± 0.25 mm for the exposed vs. the control group. However, in both age groups the difference was not significant at the 0.05 level. A comparison of AIx@HR75 between exposure group and control group both in younger age group (5.46 ± 11.22 vs. 8.56 ± 8.66) and older age group (17.55 ± 10.07 vs. 16.61 ± 5.77) revealed no significant difference. We did not find any significant correlation between CIMT and AIx@HR75 in exposed group (r = 0.314, P value = 0.145) but the correlation was significant in control group (r = 0.455, P value = 0.019). Serum cystatin C level was significantly lower in individuals with WBN exposure compared to controls (441.10 ± 104.70 ng/L vs. 616.89 ± 136.14, P value < 0.001) both in younger and older groups.CONCLUSION: We could not find any evidence for the association of WBN exposure with arterial properties, but cystatin C was significantly lower in the exposed group.","['Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aorta', 'Aviation', 'Biomarkers', 'Blood Pressure', 'Carotid Intima-Media Thickness', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cystatin C', 'Heart Rate', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Noise, Occupational', 'Occupational Exposure', 'Pulse Wave Analysis', 'Risk Factors']",27991468,"[['M01.060.116'], ['N05.715.350.075', 'N06.850.490.250'], ['A07.015.114.056'], ['J01.937.285'], ['D23.101'], ['E01.370.600.875.249', 'G09.330.380.076'], ['E01.370.350.850.150', 'E01.370.370.180', 'G09.330.210'], ['E05.318.372.500.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.500'], ['D12.776.215.300'], ['E01.370.600.875.500', 'G09.330.380.500'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['N06.230.400.500', 'N06.850.460.610.526'], ['N06.850.460.350.600'], ['E01.370.370.680'], ['E05.318.740.600.800.725', 'N05.715.350.200.700', 'N05.715.360.750.625.700.700', 'N06.850.490.625.750', 'N06.850.520.830.600.800.725']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0
Treatment decision-making and its relation to the sense of coherence and the meaning of the disease in a group of patients with colorectal cancer.,"UNLABELLED: The aims of the present study were to describe the preferred and the actual participating roles in treatment decision-making in relation to patients with newly diagnosed, colorectal cancer and to relate this result to the sociodemographic data, the Sense of Coherence Scale (SOC) and the patients' meaning of the disease. Eighty-six patients were studied. The following instruments were used: the Control Preferences Scale (CPS); the eight Lipowski categories of the meaning of the disease (LCMD); and the SOC. The results showed that 62% of the patients preferred a collaborative role and 28% a passive role in treatment decision-making. Agreement between the preferred and the actual participating roles was achieved by 44% of the patients. Seventy-one per cent of the patients showed an optimistic understanding of their disease. The mean SOC score was 150. There was no statistically significant difference between the CPS groups as regarded the sociodemographic data, the SOC and the LCMD.CONCLUSION: Sociodemographic data, the perceived meaning of the disease as well as the patients' sense of coherence were not related to the decision-making preferences in the investigated group of patients. Therefore, further investigations are needed to get an understanding of influencing factors of the decision-making preferences.","['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Colorectal Neoplasms', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Patient Participation', 'Patient Satisfaction']",11881725,"[['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['M01.060.116.100.080'], ['E05.318.740.150', 'N05.715.360.750.125', 'N06.850.520.830.150'], ['C04.588.274.476.411.307', 'C06.301.371.411.307', 'C06.405.249.411.307', 'C06.405.469.158.356', 'C06.405.469.491.307', 'C06.405.469.860.180'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['F01.100.150.750.500.620', 'F01.145.488.887.500.620', 'N02.421.143.212.300', 'N03.540.245.360.300', 'N05.300.150.800.500.620'], ['F01.100.150.750.625', 'F01.145.488.887.625', 'N04.452.822.700', 'N05.300.150.800.625', 'N05.715.360.600']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]']",0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0

According to the model suggested theoretical ratios of limiting degrees of locust bean, tara gum and guar gum galactomannan conversions by two â-(1?4)-mannanases of different origin (Myceliophthora thermophila and Trichoderma reesei) were calculated. Then the enzymes were tested for enzymatic hydrolysis of three considered galactomannans. Experimentally observed results were compared with theoretically calculated ones. It was shown that T. reesei â-mannanase attacks sequences of four and more unsubstituted mannopyranosyl residues in a row, while M. thermophila â-mannanase is a more specific enzyme and attacks sequences of five and more mannopyranosyl residues in a row.

The addition of Adriamycin to prednisone and vincristine may be beneficial in slow responders or nonresponders to these two drugs and in patients with initially high peripheral blood blast counts.","['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Doxorubicin', 'Drug Evaluation', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid', 'Male', 'Mercaptopurine', 'Methotrexate', 'Middle Aged', 'Prednisone', 'Remission, Spontaneous', 'Vincristine']",284167,"[['M01.060.057'], ['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['D02.455.426.559.847.562.050.200.175', 'D04.615.562.050.200.175', 'D09.408.051.059.200.175'], ['E05.290.625', 'E05.337.425'], ['E02.319.310'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C04.557.337.428', 'C15.604.515.560', 'C20.683.515.528'], ['D02.886.489.534', 'D03.633.100.759.570'], ['D03.633.100.733.631.192.500'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['D04.210.500.745.432.719.702'], ['C23.550.291.656.700', 'G16.767'], ['D03.132.436.681.827.817', 'D03.633.100.473.402.681.827.817', 'D03.633.100.496.500.500.681.827.817']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
Cerebral oxygen desaturation in patients with totally thoracoscopic ablation for atrial fibrillation: A prospective observational study.,"BACKGROUND: Epicardial radiofrequency ablation for stand-alone atrial fibrillation under total video-assisted thoracoscopy has gained popularity in recent years. However, severe cardiopulmonary disturbances during the surgery may affect cerebral perfusion and oxygenation. We therefore hypothesized that regional cerebral oxygen saturation (rSO2) would decrease significantly during the surgery. In addition, the influencing factors of rSO2 would be investigated.METHODS: A total of 60 patients scheduled for selective totally thoracoscopic ablation for stand-alone atrial fibrillation were enrolled in this prospective observational study. The rSO2 was monitored at baseline (T0), 15 min after anesthesia induction (T1), 15 minute after 1-lung ventilation (T2), after right pulmonary vein ablation (T3), after left pulmonary vein ablation (T4) and 15 minute after 2-lung ventilation (T5) using a near-infrared reflectance spectroscopy -based cerebral oximeter. Arterial blood gas was analyzed using an ABL 825 hemoximeter. Associations between rSO2 and hemodynamic or blood gas parameters were determined with univariate and multivariate linear regression analyses.RESULTS: The rSO2 decreased greatly from baseline 65.4% to 56.5% at T3 (P < .001). Univariate analyses showed that rSO2 correlated significantly with heart rate (r = -0.173, P = .186), mean arterial pressure (MAP, r = 0.306, P = .018), central venous pressure (r = 0.261, P = .044), arterial carbon dioxide tension (r = -0.336, P = .009), arterial oxygen pressure (PaO2, r = 0.522, P < .001), and base excess (BE, r = 0.316, P = .014). Multivariate linear regression analyses further showed that it correlated positively with PaO2 (â = 0.456, P < .001), MAP (â = 0.251, P = .020), and BE (â = 0.332, P = .003).CONCLUSION: Totally thoracoscopic ablation for atrial fibrillation caused a significant decrease in rSO2. There were positive correlations between rSO2 and PaO2, MAP, and BE.","['Aged', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Catheter Ablation', 'Cerebrovascular Circulation', 'Female', 'Hemodynamics', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Oximetry', 'Oxygen', 'Prospective Studies', 'Spectroscopy, Near-Infrared', 'Thoracic Surgery, Video-Assisted']",32332606,"[['M01.060.116.100'], ['C14.280.067.198', 'C23.550.073.198'], ['E02.808.750.500', 'E04.014.760.500'], ['G09.330.100.159'], ['G09.330.380'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['E01.370.225.124.100.100.600', 'E01.370.370.380.600', 'E01.370.386.700.100.600', 'E05.200.124.100.100.600'], ['D01.268.185.550', 'D01.362.670'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.625', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.650', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.650'], ['E01.370.350.750', 'E05.196.867.851'], ['E01.370.388.250.840.830', 'E01.370.388.250.950.830', 'E04.502.250.840.830', 'E04.502.250.950.830', 'E04.928.752.830']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Health Care [N]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
"Key KdSOC1 gene expression profiles during plantlet morphogenesis under hormone, photoperiod, and drought treatments.","Kalanchoe daigremontiana utilizes plantlet formation between its zigzag leaf margins as its method of asexual reproduction. In this study, K. daigremontiana SUPPRESSOR OF OVEREXPRESSION OF CONSTANS 1 (KdSOC1), a key intermediate in the transition from vegetative to asexual growth, was cloned. Furthermore, its expression profiles during plantlet formation under different environmental and hormone induction conditions were analyzed. The full-KdSOC1 cDNA sequence length was 1410 bp with 70% shared homology with Carya cathayensis SOC1. The conserved domain search of KdSOC1 showed the absence of I and C domains, which might indicate novel biological functions in K. daigremontiana. The full-KdSOC1 promoter sequence was 1401 bp long and contained multiple-hormone-responsive cis-acting elements. Hormone induction assays showed that gibberellins and salicylic acid mainly regulated KdSOC1 expression. The swift change from low to high KdSOC1 expression levels during long-day induction was accompanied by the rapid emergence of plantlets. Drought stress stimulated KdSOC1 expression in leaves both with and without plantlet formation. Together, the results suggested that KdSOC1 was closely involved in environmental stimulation signal perception and the transduction of K. daigremontiana plantlet formation. Therefore, future identification of KdSOC1 functions might reveal key information that will help elucidate the transition network between embryogenesis and organogenesis during plantlet formation.","['Adaptation, Physiological', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Conserved Sequence', 'DNA, Complementary', 'Droughts', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Plant', 'Kalanchoe', 'Light', 'MADS Domain Proteins', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Open Reading Frames', 'Photoperiod', 'Phylogeny', 'Plant Development', 'Plant Leaves', 'Plant Proteins', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Reproduction, Asexual', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid']",26909971,"[['G07.025', 'G16.012.500'], ['G02.111.570.060', 'L01.453.245.667.060'], ['G02.111.570.080', 'G05.360.080', 'L01.453.245.667.080'], ['E05.393.220'], ['G02.111.570.580'], ['D13.444.308.497.220', 'D13.444.600.223.500', 'D27.720.470.530.600.223.260'], ['G16.500.175.781', 'G16.500.750.775.154', 'N06.230.100.230.150'], ['G05.308.310'], ['G05.308.375'], ['B01.650.940.800.575.912.250.859.937.249.249'], ['G01.358.500.505.650', 'G01.590.540', 'G01.750.250.650', 'G01.750.770.578'], ['D12.776.260.400.249', 'D12.776.930.397'], ['L01.453.245.667'], ['G05.360.335.760.640', 'G05.360.340.024.340.137.650'], ['G01.910.675'], ['G05.697', 'G16.075.605', 'L01.100.697'], ['G07.345.625', 'G15.589'], ['A18.024.812'], ['D12.776.765'], ['D12.776.828'], ['G08.686.784.830'], ['E05.393.751'], ['G02.111.810.200', 'G05.810.200']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0
Intramammary defense against infections induced by Escherichia coli in cows.,"OBJECTIVE: To examine Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS) effects on expression of CD14 and CD18 cell surface receptors and lectin/carbohydrate-mediated nonopsonic phagocytosis of E coli.DESIGN: Cell isolation, monoclonal antibody, phagocytosis, and flow cytometric studies.ANIMALS: 4 clinically normal lactating Holstein cows for studies on CD14 and CD18, and 2 for phagocytosis studies.PROCEDURE: Binding of CD14 and CD18 monoclonal antibodies to blood and milk neutrophils and mononuclear leukocytes was studied by flow cytometry before and after intramammary injection of LPS, and nonopsonic phagocytosis of E coli by blood neutrophils was determined. Presence of intracellular CD14 was determined after in vitro incubation of neutrophils in skimmed milk and after fixation and permeabilization of freshly isolated neutrophils.RESULTS: Before LPS injection, percentages of blood neutrophils and large mononuclear (LMO) cells expressing CD14 averaged 3 and 63% and 68 and 35% for mammary neutrophils and LMO cells, respectively. After LPS injection, CD14 was only detected on blood and mammary LMO cells (61 and 25%); receptor expression increased by 1.8- and threefold, respectively. In vitro incubation of neutrophils in skimmed milk increased the percentage of neutrophils expressing CD14. The number of blood neutrophils staining positive for CD14 increased after permeabilization of the plasma membrane, which was blocked by unlabeled anti-CD14 monoclonal antibodies. Before LPS, percentages of blood neutrophils and LMO cells expressing CD18 averaged 93 and 95% and was 88 and 55% for mammary neutrophils and LMO cells, respectively. After LPS, percentages of mammary neutrophils and LMO cells expressing CD18 increased to 100 and 95%, respectively. Expression of CD18 was 2.6-fold higher for mammary neutrophils before injection of LPS, compared with blood neutrophils, either before or after LPS. In absence of opsonins, neutrophils with adherent and phagocytosed E coli averaged 83 and 14%.CONCLUSIONS: LPS modulated expression of CD14 and CD18 and lectin-carbohydrate interactions mediated nonopsonic phagocytosis of E coli. An intracellular pool of CD14 exists in bovine neutrophils and is capable of translocating to the cell surface.CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Development of methods to maximize expression of CD14 receptors on mammary neutrophils involved in production of tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and nonopsonic phagocytosis could result in reducing prevalence of mastitis in dairy cows.","['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'CD18 Antigens', 'Carbohydrates', 'Cattle', 'Escherichia coli', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Kinetics', 'Lactation', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear', 'Lipopolysaccharide Receptors', 'Lipopolysaccharides', 'Mammary Glands, Animal', 'Milk', 'Neutrophils', 'Phagocytosis', 'Time Factors']",8712510,"[['B01.050'], ['D12.776.124.486.485.114.224', 'D12.776.124.790.651.114.224', 'D12.776.377.715.548.114.224'], ['D12.776.395.550.200.275.750', 'D12.776.543.550.200.275.750', 'D12.776.543.750.705.408.200.249', 'D12.776.543.750.705.408.600.100.750', 'D12.776.543.750.705.833.249.750', 'D23.050.301.264.894.118', 'D23.050.301.350.275.750', 'D23.101.100.894.118'], ['D09'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.500.380.271'], ['B03.440.450.425.325.300', 'B03.660.250.150.180.100'], ['E01.370.225.500.363.342', 'E01.370.225.500.386.350', 'E05.196.712.516.600.240.350', 'E05.200.500.363.342', 'E05.200.500.386.350', 'E05.242.363.342', 'E05.242.386.350'], ['E05.481'], ['G01.374.661', 'G02.111.490'], ['G08.686.523', 'G08.686.702.500'], ['A11.118.637.555', 'A15.145.229.637.555', 'A15.382.490.555'], ['D12.776.395.550.448.100', 'D12.776.543.484.500.100', 'D12.776.543.550.418.100', 'D12.776.543.750.705.045', 'D23.050.301.264.900.045', 'D23.101.100.900.045'], ['D09.400.500', 'D09.698.718.450', 'D10.494', 'D23.050.161.616.525', 'D23.946.123.329.500'], ['A10.336.482', 'A13.589'], ['A12.200.455', 'A12.790', 'G07.203.100.700', 'G07.203.300.350.525', 'J02.200.700', 'J02.500.350.525'], ['A11.118.637.415.583', 'A11.627.340.583', 'A11.733.689', 'A15.145.229.637.415.583', 'A15.382.490.315.583', 'A15.382.680.689'], ['G04.417.350', 'G09.188.665', 'G12.450.564.809', 'G12.688'], ['G01.910.857']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

[Technology assessment of liver transplantation; a study of the liver transplantation program in Groningen 1977-1987].,"The liver transplantation programme of the University Hospital of Groningen, the Netherlands, was evaluated on behalf of the Dutch Sick Fund Council. From 1978 to 1987 561 patients were put forward for liver transplantation (LTX). During this period, 76 orthotopic liver transplants were carried out, 8 of which were retransplantations. Survival proved to depend on, among other things, diagnosis and age. One-year survival was 100% in children with biliary atresia and 60% in other diagnosis and age groups. The number of life-years gained by LTX depends on the stage of disease. After LTX the quality of life improves quickly. One year after LTX most survivors experience a virtually normal quality of life. The need of LTX in the Netherlands was estimated to be in the range of 25 to 69 transplantations on an annual basis. The annual supply of donor livers is expected to be about adequate. Costs amount to approx. Hfl 250,000.--per transplanted patient including costs of follow-up for up to five years. The cost-effectiveness ratio for all forms of cirrhosis was estimated at Hfl 47,000.--to 133,000.--per life year gained.

Immunophenotypic study of leukocytic subpopulations was done by citometry by using the following panel of monoclonal antibodies: CD3 (Leu-4), CD4 (Leu-3a), CD8 (Leu-2a), CD19 (Leu-12), CD14 (Leu-M3), CD11a (LFA-I), CD49d (VLA-4), CD54 (ICAM-1), CD31 (PECAM).RESULTS: It was found a significant reduction in most of the serum and secretory immunoglobulins, levels of unusual expression of integrines CD11a and CD31 in lymphocytes T related to the low percentage of activated lymphocytes T/memory.","['Adult', 'Antigens, CD', 'Blood', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules', 'Common Variable Immunodeficiency', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulins', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphocyte Subsets', 'Male', 'Saliva']",15119751,"[['M01.060.116'], ['D23.050.301.264.035', 'D23.101.100.110'], ['A12.207.152', 'A15.145'], ['D12.776.395.550.200', 'D12.776.543.550.200', 'D23.050.301.350'], ['C20.673.330'], ['E01.370.225.500.363.342', 'E01.370.225.500.386.350', 'E05.196.712.516.600.240.350', 'E05.200.500.363.342', 'E05.200.500.386.350', 'E05.242.363.342', 'E05.242.386.350'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D12.776.124.486.485', 'D12.776.124.790.651', 'D12.776.377.715.548'], ['E01.370.225.812.447', 'E05.200.812.447', 'E05.478.594.450'], ['E01.370.225.500.195.107.595', 'E01.370.225.625.107.595', 'E05.200.500.195.107.595', 'E05.200.625.107.595', 'E05.242.195.107.595', 'G04.140.107.595', 'G09.188.105.595'], ['E01.370.225.812.482', 'E05.200.812.482', 'E05.478.594.530', 'G12.450.050.400.545', 'G12.565'], ['A11.118.637.555.567.550', 'A15.145.229.637.555.567.550', 'A15.382.490.555.567.550'], ['A12.200.666']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
Sequencing and genotypic analysis of the triosephosphate isomerase (TPI1) locus in a large sample of long-lived Germans.,"BACKGROUND: Triosephosphate isomerase (TPI) is a central and conserved glycolytic enzyme. In humans, TPI is encoded by a single gene on 12p13, and associated with a rare genetic disorder, TPI deficiency. Reduced TPI activity can increase specific oxidant resistances of model organisms and TPI null-alleles have been hypothesized to promote a heterozygote advantage in man. However, comprehensive genetic information about the TPI1 locus is still lacking.RESULTS: Here, we sequenced the TPI1 locus in a sample of 357 German long-lived individuals (LLI) aged 95 to 110 years. We identified 17 different polymorphisms, of which 15 were rare and previously unknown. The two remaining SNPs occurred at much higher frequency and were tested for association with the longevity phenotype in larger samples of LLI (n = 1422) and younger controls (n = 967). Neither of the two markers showed a statistically significant difference in allele or genotype frequency between LLI and control subjects.CONCLUSION: This study marks the TPI1 locus as extraordinarily conserved, even when analyzing intronic and non-coding regions of the gene. None of the identified sequence variations affected the amino acid composition of the TPI protein and hence, are unlikely to impact the catalytic activity of the enzyme. Thus, TPI variants occur less frequent than expected and inactive alleles are not enriched in German centenarians.","['Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genotype', 'Germany', 'Humans', 'Isoenzymes', 'Male', 'Mutation', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Triose-Phosphate Isomerase']",18510744,"[['M01.060.116.100.080'], ['G05.330'], ['G05.365'], ['G05.380'], ['Z01.542.315'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D08.811.348', 'D12.776.800.300'], ['G05.365.590'], ['G05.365.795.598'], ['E05.393.760.700'], ['D08.811.399.475.200.775']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1
Mutations in sdh (succinate dehydrogenase genes) alter the thiamine requirement of Salmonella typhimurium.,"Mutants lacking the first enzyme in de novo purine synthesis (PurF) can synthesize thiamine if increased levels of pantothenate are present in the culture medium (J. L. Enos-Berlage and D. M. Downs, J. Bacteriol. 178:1476-1479, 1996). Derivatives of purF mutants that no longer required pantothenate for thiamine-independent growth were isolated. Analysis of these mutants demonstrated that they were defective in succinate dehydrogenase (Sdh), an enzyme of the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Results of phenotypic analyses suggested that a defect in Sdh decreased the thiamine requirement of Salmonella typhimurium. This reduced requirement correlated with levels of succinyl-coenzyme A (succinyl-CoA), which is synthesized in a thiamine pyrophosphate-dependent reaction. The effect of succinyl-CoA on thiamine metabolism was distinct from the role of pantothenate in thiamine synthesis.","['Acyl Coenzyme A', 'Mutation', 'Pantothenic Acid', 'Salmonella typhimurium', 'Succinate Dehydrogenase', 'Succinates', 'Succinic Acid', 'Thiamine']",9190816,"[['D03.633.100.759.646.138.382.300', 'D08.211.211.300', 'D13.695.667.138.382.300', 'D13.695.827.068.382.300'], ['G05.365.590'], ['D02.478.520', 'D12.125.042.070.500'], ['B03.440.450.425.800.200.825', 'B03.660.250.150.710.160.760'], ['D05.500.562.750.249.500', 'D08.811.600.250.500.750.500', 'D08.811.600.250.875.249.500', 'D08.811.682.660.385.500', 'D08.811.682.830.249.500', 'D12.776.157.427.374.375.909.500', 'D12.776.331.199.750.500', 'D12.776.543.277.500.750.500', 'D12.776.543.277.875.249.500', 'D12.776.556.579.374.375.141.500'], ['D02.241.081.337.759'], ['D02.241.081.337.759.625'], ['D02.886.675.900', 'D03.383.129.708.900', 'D03.383.742.795']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]']",0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Left ventricular aneurysm repair: a comparison of linear versus patch remodeling.,"BACKGROUND: Surgical repair of left ventricular (LV) aneurysm has been performed for around 50 years. However, the most appropriate surgical approach remains undetermined. This study was undertaken to compare the efficacy of 2 established techniques, linear versus patch remodeling, for repair of dyskinetic LV aneurysms.METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the records of 49 patients (mean age, 69.8 +/- 7.3 years) who had operation for postinfarction dyskinetic LV aneurysm between 1996 and 2006. Thirty-one patients underwent patch remodeling and 18 underwent linear repair. Short-term and mid-term outcomes, including complications, cardiac function and mortality, were assessed.RESULTS: Overall inhospital surgical mortality, major complications and early hemodynamics showed no significant differences between the 2 groups. During a mean follow-up of 44.0 +/- 34.4 months, 8 patients died, with 4 due to cardiac-related causes. Actuarial survival rates at 1, 5 and 10 years were 85.7%, 69.9% and 45.7%, respectively. Functional class improved from 2.51 +/- 0.59 to 1.66 +/- 0.54 among the mid-term survivors (p < 0.001), with no significant difference between the 2 groups. Multivariate analysis identified preoperative NYHA functional class >or= 3 as an independent risk factor for overall mortality (p = 0.008). Mid-term follow-up revealed that LV ejection fraction improved from 26.5 +/- 7.2% to 34.1 +/- 7.9% (p < 0.001) in the patch group, and from 26.3 +/- 9.0% to 32.0 +/- 9.2% in the linear group (p = 0.032). In contrast, right ventricular ejection fraction improved from 49.4 +/- 10.1% to 52.0 +/- 7.3% (p = 0.190) in the patch group, but deteriorated from 55.0 +/- 6.3% to 50.3 +/- 8.6% in the linear group (p = 0.029).CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that the 2 repair techniques have similar effectiveness with respect to short- and mid-term outcomes except for right ventricular ejection fraction. We suggest that the selection of repair technique for LV aneurysms should be individualized for each patient based on aneurysm size and extent of the scarring process into the septum and subvalvular mitral apparatus.","['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cardiac Surgical Procedures', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Heart Aneurysm', 'Heart Ventricles', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Survival Rate', 'Ventricular Function, Left', 'Ventricular Function, Right']",19686997,"[['M01.060.116.100'], ['M01.060.116.100.080'], ['E04.100.376', 'E04.928.220'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.249', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.350', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.350'], ['C14.280.358', 'C14.907.055.608'], ['A07.541.560'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['E05.318.308.985.550.900', 'N01.224.935.698.826', 'N06.850.505.400.975.550.900', 'N06.850.520.308.985.550.900'], ['G09.330.955.800'], ['G09.330.955.900']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
Acute and long-term results of slow pathway ablation in patients with atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia--an analysis of the predictive factors for arrhythmia recurrence.,"BACKGROUND: Predictors of atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT) recurrence after radiofrequency ablation including the importance of residual slow pathway conduction are not known. The aim of this study was to report the acute and long-term results of slow pathway ablation in a large series of consecutive patients with AVNRT and to analyze the potential predictors of arrhythmia recurrence with a particular emphasis on the residual slow pathway conduction after ablation.METHODS: The study included 506 consecutive patients with AVNRT (mean age 52.6 +/- 16 years, 315 women) who underwent slow pathway ablation using a combined electrophysiological and anatomical approach. The end point of ablation procedure was noninducibility of the arrhythmia. The primary end point of the study was the recurrence of AVNRT.RESULTS: Acute success was achieved in 500 patients (98.8%). After ablation, 471 patients (93%) were followed up for a mean of 903 +/- 692 days. Of the 465 patients with successful ablation, 24 patients (5.2%) developed AVNRT recurrences during the follow-up. No significant differences in the cumulative rates of AVNRT recurrence were observed in groups with or without electrophysiological evidence of residual slow pathway conduction (P = 0.25, log-rank test). Multivariate analysis identified only age as an independent predictor of AVNRT recurrence (hazard ratio 0.96, 95% confidence interval 0.94-0.99, P = 0.004) with younger patients being at an increased risk for arrhythmia recurrence.CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrated that only younger age, but not other clinical or electrophysiological parameters including residual slow pathway conduction predicted an increased risk for AVNRT recurrence after slow pathway radiofrequency ablation.","['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Catheter Ablation', 'Child', 'Electrophysiologic Techniques, Cardiac', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Recurrence', 'Statistics, Nonparametric', 'Tachycardia, Atrioventricular Nodal Reentry', 'Treatment Outcome']",15679639,"[['M01.060.057'], ['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['M01.060.116.100.080'], ['E02.808.750.500', 'E04.014.760.500'], ['M01.060.406'], ['E01.370.370.380.245', 'E01.370.405.267'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['E05.318.370.800.650', 'N05.715.360.325.700.640', 'N06.850.520.445.800.650'], ['E05.318.740.500.700', 'E05.318.740.600.700', 'E05.318.740.750.725', 'E05.318.740.998.825', 'E05.599.835.900', 'N05.715.360.750.530.650', 'N05.715.360.750.625.650', 'N05.715.360.750.695.650', 'N05.715.360.750.795.825', 'N06.850.520.830.500.700', 'N06.850.520.830.600.700', 'N06.850.520.830.750.725', 'N06.850.520.830.998.912'], ['C23.550.291.937'], ['E05.318.740.995', 'N05.715.360.750.760', 'N06.850.520.830.995'], ['C14.280.067.845.787.249', 'C14.280.123.875.787.249', 'C23.550.073.845.787.500'], ['E01.789.800', 'N04.761.559.590.800', 'N05.715.360.575.575.800']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Diseases [C]']",0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
Usefulness of targeting lymphocyte Kv1.3-channels in the treatment of respiratory diseases.,"T lymphocytes predominantly express delayed rectifier K(+)-channels (Kv1.3) in their plasma membranes. Patch-clamp studies revealed that the channels play crucial roles in facilitating the calcium influx necessary to trigger lymphocyte activation and proliferation. Using selective channel inhibitors in experimental animal models, in vivo studies further revealed the clinically relevant relationship between the channel expression and the development of chronic respiratory diseases, in which chronic inflammation or the overstimulation of cellular immunity in the airways is responsible for the pathogenesis. In chronic respiratory diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, diffuse panbronchiolitis and cystic fibrosis, in addition to the supportive management for the symptoms, the anti-inflammatory effects of macrolide antibiotics were shown to be effective against the over-activation or proliferation of T lymphocytes. Recently, we provided physiological and pharmacological evidence that macrolide antibiotics, together with calcium channel blockers, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, effectively suppress the Kv1.3-channel currents in lymphocytes, and thus exert anti-inflammatory or immunomodulatory effects. In this review article, based on the findings obtained from recent in vivo and in vitro studies, we address the novel therapeutic implications of targeting the lymphocyte Kv1.3-channels for the treatment of chronic or acute respiratory diseases.","['Animals', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Humans', 'Kv1.3 Potassium Channel', 'Lymphocytes', 'Macrolides', 'Potassium Channel Blockers', 'Respiratory Tract Diseases']",26206235,"[['B01.050'], ['E02.319.300'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D12.776.157.530.400.600.900.500.217', 'D12.776.543.550.450.750.900.124.358', 'D12.776.543.585.400.750.900.624.217'], ['A11.118.637.555.567', 'A15.145.229.637.555.567', 'A15.382.490.555.567'], ['D02.540.505', 'D02.540.576.500', 'D04.345.674.500'], ['D27.505.519.562.500', 'D27.505.954.411.645'], ['C08']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Diseases [C]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Involvement of globus pallidus and midbrain nuclei in pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration: measurement of T2 and T2* time.,"PURPOSE: To quantify involvement of globus pallidus and two midbrain nuclei (substantia nigra and red nucleus) in Pantothenate Kinase-Associated Neurodegeneration (PKAN).MATERIAL AND METHODS: We performed T2 and T2* weighted imaging with calculation of the corresponding relaxation times on a subset of 5 patients from a larger group of 20 patients with PKAN from the southwest part of the Dominican Republic. Examinations were carried out on a 3T scanner and included a multi-echo spin-echo as well as a multi-echo gradient echo sequence. Results were compared to a control group of 19 volunteers.RESULTS: T2 and T2* weighted sequences showed abnormal signal reduction in the globus pallidus of all patients. On T2* weighted imaging, abnormal signal in the substantia nigra could reliably be detected in 75% of cases, but differentiation from normal was less reliable in T2 weighted scans. Correspondingly, relaxation times differed from normal with very high significance (p < 0.0001) in the globus pallidus, but with with less significance in the substantia nigra (p ? 0.03). The red nucleus was not affected.CONCLUSIONS: Signal reduction in the globus pallidus, which probably is due to abnormal accumulation of iron, is severe in PKAN and can be differentiated from normal with high reliability.

Chaetocin reactivates the lytic replication of Epstein-Barr virus from latency via reactive oxygen species.,"Oxidative stress, regarded as a negative effect of free radicals in vivo, takes place when organisms suffer from harmful stimuli. Some viruses can induce the release of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in infected cells, which may be closely related with their pathogenicity. In this report, chaetocin, a fungal metabolite reported to have antimicrobial and cytostatic activity, was studied for its effect on the activation of latent Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) in B95-8 cells. We found that chaetocin remarkably up-regulated EBV lytic transcription and DNA replication at a low concentration (50 nmol L-1). The activation of latent EBV was accompanied by an increased cellular ROS level. N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC), an ROS inhibitor, suppressed chaetocin-induced EBV activation. Chaetocin had little effect on histone H3K9 methylation, while NAC also significantly reduced H3K9 methylation. These results suggested that chaetocin reactivates latent EBV primarily via ROS pathways.","['Acetylcysteine', 'Animals', 'Antigens, Viral', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Blotting, Western', 'Callithrix', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Free Radical Scavengers', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Glutathione Peroxidase', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human', 'Histones', 'Host-Pathogen Interactions', 'Humans', 'Lysine', 'Methylation', 'NADH Dehydrogenase', 'Phospholipid Hydroperoxide Glutathione Peroxidase', 'Piperazines', 'Reactive Oxygen Species', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Trans-Activators', 'Virus Activation', 'Virus Latency', 'Virus Replication']",28063010,"[['D02.886.030.230.259', 'D12.125.166.230.259'], ['B01.050'], ['D23.050.327'], ['A11.063.438', 'A11.118.637.555.567.562', 'A15.145.229.637.555.567.562', 'A15.382.032.438', 'A15.382.490.555.567.562'], ['E05.196.401.143', 'E05.301.300.096', 'E05.478.566.320.200', 'E05.601.262', 'E05.601.470.320.200'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.600.150.150.114'], ['A11.251.210.172'], ['G07.690.773.875', 'G07.690.936.500'], ['D27.505.519.217.500'], ['G05.308'], ['D08.811.682.732.500'], ['B04.280.210.400.500.450', 'B04.280.382.400.500.400', 'B04.613.204.500.500.400'], ['D12.776.157.687.485', 'D12.776.660.720.485', 'D12.776.664.469'], ['G06.462', 'G16.527.200'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D12.125.068.555', 'D12.125.095.647', 'D12.125.142.497'], ['G02.111.035.538', 'G02.607.094.538', 'G03.059.538'], ['D08.811.682.608.504.500', 'D12.776.157.427.374.375.863.500', 'D12.776.331.887', 'D12.776.556.579.374.375.140.500'], ['D08.811.682.732.925'], ['D03.383.606'], ['D01.339.431', 'D01.650.775'], ['E05.393.620.500.725'], ['D12.776.260.755', 'D12.776.930.900', 'D12.776.964.925.984'], ['G06.920.925.940'], ['G06.920.900'], ['G06.920.925']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
The trichrome-stained smear as a screening method for intestinal parasites: evaluation in a San Francisco Bay Area population.,"The trichrome-stained smear and the formalin-ether concentrate were compared for detecting and identifying intestinal parasites. Using both methods, 15,414 outpatient and inpatient specimens were examined. Of 2,773 intestinal parasites recovered, 2,633 (94.9%) were protozoa. The trichrome-stained smear detected 97.0% of the intestinal protozoa and 38.9% of intestinal helminths. We conclude that, in geographic areas where protozoan infections are more common, the trichrome-stained smear alone may be used as a screening method for intestinal parasites if personnel are trained to recognize helminth eggs and larvae in the trichrome-stained smear.","['Azo Compounds', 'Coloring Agents', 'Eosine Yellowish-(YS)', 'Ethers', 'Feces', 'Formaldehyde', 'Helminthiasis', 'Humans', 'Intestinal Diseases, Parasitic', 'Methyl Green', 'Protozoan Infections', 'Staining and Labeling']",6180639,"[['D02.172'], ['D27.720.233'], ['D02.455.426.779.347.325', 'D03.633.300.953.275.325', 'D04.711.347.325'], ['D02.355'], ['A12.459'], ['D02.047.407'], ['C01.610.335'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C01.610.432', 'C06.405.469.452'], ['D02.092.146.475'], ['C01.610.752'], ['E01.370.225.500.620.670', 'E01.370.225.750.600.670', 'E05.200.500.620.670', 'E05.200.750.600.670']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Long-term succinylcholine infusion during isoflurane anesthesia.,"The characteristics of the neuromuscular blockade produced by prolonged succinylcholine infusion were compared in 40 patients anesthetized with either nitrous-oxide-isoflurane (0.75-1.50% inspired) or nitrous-oxide-fentanyl. Neuromuscular transmission was monitored using train-of-four stimulation and the infusion rate was adjusted to keep the first twitch at 10-15% of its control value. Initially, all patients exhibited a depolarizing-type block, and the infusion rates were similar in the isoflurane (61 micrograms . kg-1 . min-1) and fentanyl (57 micrograms . kg-1 . min-1) groups. Tachyphylaxis developed in both groups and correlated well with the onset of non-depolarizing (phase II) block. Both occurred sooner and at a lower cumulative dose in the isoflurane groups. After 90 min, infusion rates were similar in both groups (isoflurane: 107 micrograms . kg-1 . min-1, fentanyl;: 93 micrograms. kg-1 . min-1). After the infusion was stopped, the recovery of the train-of-four ratio was inversely related to the dose and duration of exposure to succinylcholine, and was slower with nitrous-oxide-isoflurane anesthesia. After 10 min of recovery, patients receiving isoflurane exhibited train-of-four ratios of 0.5 or less after 8.5 mg/kg succinylcholine and 103 min. Corresponding figures for fentanyl patients were 13 mg/kg and 171 min. The block in all 13 patients (eight with isoflurane, five with fentanyl) who did not recover spontaneously was antagonized successfully with atropine and neostigmine. It was concluded that with succinylcholine infusion of 90 min or less, isoflurane accelerates the onset of tachyphylaxis and phase II neuromuscular block without affecting succinylcholine requirements. These results, with isoflurane, were similar to those reported previously with enflurane or halothane.","['Adult', 'Aged', 'Anesthesia, Inhalation', 'Drug Interactions', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Female', 'Fentanyl', 'Humans', 'Isoflurane', 'Male', 'Methyl Ethers', 'Middle Aged', 'Neuromuscular Junction', 'Nitrous Oxide', 'Succinylcholine', 'Synaptic Transmission', 'Tachyphylaxis']",6293347,"[['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['E03.155.197.197'], ['G07.690.773.968'], ['E05.723.402'], ['D03.383.621.265'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D02.355.601.570'], ['D02.355.601'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['A08.800.550.550.550', 'A08.850.550.550', 'A11.284.149.165.420.780.550.550'], ['D01.362.635.625', 'D01.625.550.550', 'D01.650.550.587.650'], ['D02.092.877.883.333.780', 'D02.241.081.337.759.875', 'D02.675.276.232.780'], ['G02.111.820.850', 'G04.835.850', 'G07.265.880', 'G11.561.830'], ['G07.690.773.992.910', 'G12.535.425.910']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
Control and estimation of anaerobic digestion processes using hydrogen and volatile fatty acids measurements.,"The anaerobic digestion (AD) technology is widely used in the treatment of waste and wastewater. To ensure the treatment efficiency and to increase the production of biogas, which can be reused as a renewable energy source, a good understanding of the process and tight control are needed. This paper presents an estimation and control scheme, which can be successfully used in the operation of the AD process. The process is simulated by the ADM1 model, the most complex and detailed model developed so far to characterize AD. The controller and the observer, which provides estimates of the unmeasurable variables needed in the computation of the control law, are designed based on a simplified model developed in a previous work. Since it has been shown that hydrogen concentration is an accurate and fast indicator of process stability, it was chosen as controlled variable. Aside from the hydrogen concentration, the only measurement employed by the proposed control structure is the volatile fatty acids concentration. Simulation results prove the effectiveness of the proposed control structure.","['Anaerobiosis', 'Biofuels', 'Bioreactors', 'Fatty Acids, Volatile', 'Hydrogen', 'Waste Disposal, Fluid']",30629530,"[['G02.111.062', 'G03.078'], ['D20.147', 'N06.230.132.644.124'], ['E07.115', 'J01.897.120.115'], ['D10.251.400'], ['D01.268.406', 'D01.362.340'], ['N06.850.780.200.800.800.890', 'N06.850.860.510.900.600.900']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]']",0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0
Characterization of murine cytomegalovirus m157 from infected cells and identification of critical residues mediating recognition by the NK cell receptor Ly49H.,"Activated NK cells mediate potent cytolytic and secretory effector functions and are vital components of the early antiviral immune response. NK cell activities are regulated by the assortment of inhibitory receptors that recognize MHC class I ligands expressed on healthy cells and activating receptors that recognize inducible host ligands or ligands that are not well characterized. The activating Ly49H receptor of mouse NK cells is unique in that it specifically recognizes a virally encoded ligand, the m157 glycoprotein of murine CMV (MCMV). The Ly49H-m157 interaction underlies a potent resistance mechanism (Cmv1) in C57BL/6 mice and serves as an excellent model in which to understand how NK cells are specifically activated in vivo, as similar receptor systems are operative for human NK cells. For transduced cells expressing m157 in isolation and for MCMV-infected cells, we show that m157 is expressed in multiple isoforms with marked differences in abundance between infected fibroblasts (high) and macrophages (low). At the cell surface, m157 is exclusively a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-associated protein in MCMV-infected cells. Through random and site-directed mutagenesis of m157, we identify unique residues that provide for efficient cell surface expression of m157 but fail to activate Ly49H-expressing reporter cells. These m157 mutations are predicted to alter the conformation of a putative m157 interface with Ly49H, one that relies on the position of a critical alpha0 helix of m157. These findings support an emerging model for a novel interaction between this important NK cell receptor and its viral ligand.","['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antigens, Ly', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Glycoproteins', 'Glycosylphosphatidylinositols', 'Lectins, C-Type', 'Mice', 'Models, Molecular', 'Muromegalovirus', 'Mutation', 'NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily A', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Receptors, NK Cell Lectin-Like', 'Viral Proteins']",18566392,"[['B01.050'], ['D12.776.124.486.485.114.224', 'D12.776.124.790.651.114.224', 'D12.776.377.715.548.114.224'], ['D23.050.301.264.920', 'D23.101.100.920'], ['A11.251.210'], ['A11.284.149'], ['G05.308.385'], ['D09.400.430', 'D12.776.395'], ['D09.400.410.475', 'D10.390.475', 'D10.570.755.375.760.400.942.250'], ['D12.776.503.280'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500'], ['E05.599.595'], ['B04.280.382.150.500'], ['G05.365.590'], ['D12.776.543.750.705.895.800.100', 'D23.050.301.264.920.500', 'D23.101.100.920.500'], ['G02.111.679', 'G03.808'], ['D12.776.800'], ['G02.111.570.820.709.610'], ['D12.776.543.750.705.895.800'], ['D12.776.964']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Multiple sensitive periods in the development of the primate visual system.,"Early in life, abnormal visual experience may disrupt the developmental processes required for the maturation and maintenance of normal visual function. The effects of retinal image deprivation (monocular form deprivation) on four psychophysical functions were investigated in rhesus monkeys to determine if the sensitive period is of the same duration for all types of visual information processing. The basic spectral sensitivity functions of rods and cones have relatively short sensitive periods of development (3 and 6 months) when compared to more complex functions such as monocular spatial vision or resolution (25 months) and binocular vision (greater than 25 months). Therefore, there are multiple, partially overlapping sensitive periods of development and the sensitive period for each specific visual function is probably different.","['Age Factors', 'Animals', 'Humans', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Photoreceptor Cells', 'Sensory Deprivation', 'Space Perception', 'Vision, Ocular', 'Visual Perception']",3952507,"[['N05.715.350.075', 'N06.850.490.250'], ['B01.050'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.199.120.510.550'], ['A08.675.650.850.625', 'A08.675.650.915.937', 'A08.800.950.937', 'A09.371.729.831.625', 'A11.671.650.850.625', 'A11.671.650.915.937'], ['F02.463.593.696'], ['F02.463.593.778'], ['F02.830.816.964', 'G02.111.820.480.900', 'G04.835.480.900', 'G11.561.790.964', 'G14.935'], ['F02.463.593.932']]","['Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
In vitro evaluation of sustained ciprofloxacin release from ê-carrageenan-crosslinked chitosan/hydroxyapatite hydrogel nanocomposites.,"Although the traditional hydrogels have shown great potential applications in designing drug delivery systems, the burst release of drugs remains an issue. In this work, we develop and evaluate a sustained release of ciprofloxacin using chitosan/hydroxyapatite/ê-carrageenan complexes. The size and structure of HA nanoparticles were characterized by X-ray diffraction, transmittance electron microscopy, and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy. The ciprofloxacin-loaded hydrogel nanocomposites exhibited antibacterial activity against Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus and Gram-negative Escherichia coli bacteria. Due to the introduced HA, the release of ciprofloxacin occurred in a sustained release manner. While the pristine chitosan/ê-carrageenan complex released about 98% of ciprofloxacin during 120 h, only 52 and 66% of the loaded drug was released from hydrogel nanocomposites containing high and low content of HA, respectively. The sustained release of ciprofloxacin from the hydrogel nanocomposites identifies them as a potential candidate for designing drug delivery systems with prolonged release ability.","['Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Carrageenan', 'Chitosan', 'Ciprofloxacin', 'Cross-Linking Reagents', 'Drug Liberation', 'Durapatite', 'Escherichia coli', 'Hydrogels', 'Kinetics', 'Microbial Sensitivity Tests', 'Nanocomposites', 'Spectrometry, X-Ray Emission', 'Spectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared', 'Staphylococcus aureus', 'X-Ray Diffraction']",30594616,"[['D27.505.954.122.085'], ['D09.698.152'], ['D05.750.078.139.500', 'D09.698.211.500'], ['D03.633.100.810.835.322.186'], ['D27.720.470.410.210'], ['G02.211', 'G03.787.321', 'G07.690.725.321'], ['D01.029.260.700.675.374.075.025.300.150', 'D01.146.360.050.300.200', 'D01.578.122.477.300', 'D01.695.625.675.650.075.025.300.150'], ['B03.440.450.425.325.300', 'B03.660.250.150.180.100'], ['D20.280.320.375', 'D26.255.165.320.375'], ['G01.374.661', 'G02.111.490'], ['E01.370.225.875.595', 'E05.200.875.595', 'E05.337.550.400'], ['J01.637.512.150'], ['E05.196.867.800', 'E05.799.830'], ['E05.196.712.726.676.700', 'E05.196.867.826.676.700'], ['B03.300.390.400.800.750.100', 'B03.353.500.750.750.100', 'B03.510.100.750.750.100', 'B03.510.400.790.750.100'], ['E05.196.309.742', 'E05.196.822.950', 'G01.867.950', 'G02.965']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]']",0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
Extensive lesions of cholinergic basal forebrain neurons do not impair spatial working memory.,"A recent study suggests that lesions to all major areas of the cholinergic basal forebrain in the rat (medial septum, horizontal limb of the diagonal band of Broca, and nucleus basalis magnocellularis) impair a spatial working memory task. However, this experiment used a surgical technique that may have damaged cerebellar Purkinje cells. The present study tested rats with highly selective lesions of cholinergic neurons in all major areas of the basal forebrain on a spatial working memory task in the radial arm maze. In postoperative testing, there were no significant differences between lesion and control groups in working memory, even with a delay period of 8 h, with the exception of a transient impairment during the first 2 d of postoperative testing at shorter delays (0 or 2 h). This finding corroborates other results that indicate that the cholinergic basal forebrain does not play a significant role in spatial working memory. Furthermore, it underscores the presence of intact memory functions after cholinergic basal forebrain damage, despite attentional impairments that follow these lesions, demonstrated in other task paradigms.","['Acetylcholine', 'Animals', 'Cholinergic Fibers', 'Male', 'Memory, Short-Term', 'Neurons', 'Prosencephalon', 'Rats', 'Rats, Long-Evans', 'Space Perception']",14747521,"[['D02.092.211.111'], ['B01.050'], ['A08.675.127.500', 'A08.675.542.234', 'A11.671.188.500', 'A11.671.501.234'], ['F02.463.425.540.407'], ['A08.675', 'A11.671'], ['A08.186.211.200'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700.500'], ['F02.463.593.778']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]']",1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
"A critical coiled coil motif in the small terminase, gp16, from bacteriophage T4: insights into DNA packaging initiation and assembly of packaging motor.","Double-stranded DNA packaging in bacteriophages is driven by one of the most powerful force-generating molecular motors reported to date. The phage T4 motor is composed of the small terminase protein, gpl6 (18kDa), the large terminase protein, gp17 (70kDa), and the dodecameric portal protein gp20 (61kDa). gp16, which exists as an oligomer in solution, is involved in the recognition of the viral DNA substrate, the very first step in the DNA packaging pathway, and stimulates the ATPase and packaging activities associated with gp17. Sequence analyses using COILS2 revealed the presence of coiled coil motifs (CCMs) in gp16. Sixteen T4-family and numerous phage small terminases show CCMs in the corresponding region of the protein, suggesting a common structural and functional theme. Biochemical properties such as reversible thermal denaturation and analytical gel filtration data suggest that the central CCM-1 is critical for oligomerization of gp16. Mutations in CCM-1 that change the hydrophobicity of key residues, or pH 6.0, destabilized coiled coil interactions, resulting in a loss of gp16 oligomerization. The gp16 oligomers are in a dynamic equilibrium with lower M(r) intermediate species and monomer. Monomeric gp16 is unable to stimulate gp17-ATPase, an activity essential for DNA packaging, while conversion back into oligomeric form restored the activity. These data for the first time defined a CCM that is critical for structure and function of the small terminase. We postulate a packaging model in which the gp16 CCM is implicated in the regulation of packaging initiation and assembly of a supramolecular DNA packaging machine on the viral concatemer.","['Adenosine Triphosphatases', 'Amino Acid Motifs', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Bacteriophage T4', 'DNA Packaging', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Endodeoxyribonucleases', 'Gene Expression', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Motor Proteins', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', 'Protein Structure, Secondary', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Viral Proteins', 'Virus Assembly']",16513134,"[['D08.811.277.040.025'], ['G02.111.570.820.709.275.500', 'G02.111.570.820.709.600.500'], ['G02.111.570.060', 'L01.453.245.667.060'], ['B04.123.150.500.350', 'B04.123.205.891.200', 'B04.280.090.500.350'], ['G04.400', 'G05.213'], ['D12.776.260'], ['D08.811.277.352.335.350', 'D08.811.277.352.355.325'], ['G05.297'], ['G02.300'], ['E05.599.595'], ['D05.500.500', 'D08.811.277.040.025.193'], ['L01.453.245.667'], ['G05.365.590'], ['G02.111.570.820.709.600'], ['E05.393.751'], ['D12.776.964'], ['G06.920.925.950']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
[Stratified cylindrical epithelium of the human urethra. Apropos of various cytological observations on urocytograms].,"The stratified columnar cells of the human urethra were studied by the filtering membrane technique in urocytograms usually effected, or in smears made after a cytoscopy or after an ejaculation. The cells were present in 61% of systematic filters without inflammation, in 82% of inflammatory filters, and in the urine of 90% of persons after a cytoscopy. The mean number of columnar cells did not exceed 1% in usual filters without inflammation; the percentage varied with the donor sex, but it did not show a significant variation with the donor age. The presence of an inflammation in filters is followed by an increase of the number of columnar cells (until 6%) and of clumps. The columnar cells were numerous in the bladder-washing liquid postcytoscopy (until 40%); their number rapidly decreased in further filters and became to nil between days 7 and 9 after the cytoscopy. The cell clumps showed the same evolution, but they disappeared in filters more rapidly. The significance of these results is discussed.","['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Ejaculation', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Epithelium', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Therapeutic Irrigation', 'Urethra', 'Urethritis']",1790351,"[['M01.060.057'], ['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['M01.060.116.100.080'], ['M01.060.406'], ['M01.060.406.448'], ['G08.686.784.084'], ['A11.436'], ['A10.272'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['E02.779.492.500', 'E02.831.535.492.500', 'E05.927'], ['A05.360.444.492.726', 'A05.810.876'], ['C12.777.767.851', 'C13.351.968.767.851']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Diseases [C]']",1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
Vaccination with p53 peptide-pulsed dendritic cells is associated with disease stabilization in patients with p53 expressing advanced breast cancer; monitoring of serum YKL-40 and IL-6 as response biomarkers.,"p53 Mutations are found in up to 30% of breast cancers and peptides derived from over-expressed p53 protein are presented by class I HLA molecules and may act as tumor-associated epitopes in cancer vaccines. A dendritic cell (DC) based p53 targeting vaccine was analyzed in HLA-A2+ patients with progressive advanced breast cancer. DCs were loaded with 3 wild-type and 3 P2 anchor modified HLA-A2 binding p53 peptides. Patients received up to 10 sc vaccinations with 5 x 10(6) p53-peptide loaded DC with 1-2 weeks interval. Concomitantly, 6 MIU/m(2) interleukine-2 was administered sc. Results from a phase II trial including 26 patients with verified progressive breast cancer are presented. Seven patients discontinued treatment after only 2-3 vaccination weeks due to rapid disease progression or death. Nineteen patients were available for first evaluation after 6 vaccinations; 8/19 evaluable patients attained stable disease (SD) or minor regression while 11/19 patients had progressive disease (PD), indicating an effect of p53-specific immune therapy. This was supported by: (1) a positive correlation between p53 expression of tumor and observed SD, (2) therapy induced p53 specific T cells in 4/7 patients with SD but only in 2/9 patients with PD, and (3) significant response associated changes in serum YKL-40 and IL-6 levels identifying these biomarkers as possible candidates for monitoring of response in connection with DC based cancer immunotherapy. In conclusion, a significant fraction of breast cancer patients obtained SD during p53-targeting DC therapy. Data encourage initiation of a randomized trial in p53 positive patients evaluating the impact on progression free survival.","['Adipokines', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Breast Neoplasms', 'Cancer Vaccines', 'Chitinase-3-Like Protein 1', 'Dendritic Cells', 'Female', 'Glycoproteins', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6', 'Lectins', 'Middle Aged', 'Peptide Fragments', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53', 'Vaccination']",17285289,"[['D06.472.699.042', 'D12.644.276.024', 'D12.644.548.011', 'D12.776.467.024', 'D23.529.024'], ['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['D23.101.140'], ['C04.588.180', 'C17.800.090.500'], ['D20.215.894.200'], ['D08.811.277.450.207.500', 'D12.776.503.070'], ['A11.066.270', 'A11.436.270', 'A15.382.066.270', 'A15.382.670.260'], ['D09.400.430', 'D12.776.395'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D12.644.276.374.465.224', 'D12.776.467.374.465.202', 'D23.529.374.465.224'], ['D12.776.503'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['D12.644.541'], ['D12.776.157.687.650', 'D12.776.260.820', 'D12.776.624.776.775', 'D12.776.660.720.650', 'D12.776.744.845'], ['E02.095.465.425.400.530.890', 'E05.478.550.600.890', 'N02.421.726.758.310.890', 'N06.850.780.200.425.900', 'N06.850.780.680.310.890']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
[The problem with endoleakage in endoluminal therapy].,"Endovascular treatment of aortic aneurysms with stent grafts was performed increasingly in recent years. The most frequent complication after endovascular therapy of aortic aneurysms is an endoleak. In case of a persistent endoleak, diameter of the aneurysm is increasing with a high risk of aneurysm rupture. Diagnostic tools are spiral computed tomography and angiography. Spiral computed tomography is the most sensitive method for the diagnosis of an endoleak ad should be performed with a biphasic acquisition. In- and outflow of sidebranches can be identified correctly with selective angiography in 86%. Perigraft endoleaks should be treated in any case. Patent side branches generally are observed over a period of 6 months. After 6 months approximately half of these endoleaks are thrombosed. Is there an increasing of the diameter of the aneurysm or any changing in the morphology of the aneurysm there is an indication for embolisation of these sidebranches of the aneurysmal sac. Preinterventional embolisation of patent sidebranches is under discussion. Type I endoleaks can be managed by additional stent-graft implantation or coil embolisation. In case of type II endoleaks in- ad outflow vessles should be embolised with coils. Therapy of type III endoleak is performed mostly by additional stent-graft placement. The total incidence of secondary interventions in the Eurostar-study was nearly 10% per year.","['Aneurysm, Dissecting', 'Aortic Aneurysm, Abdominal', 'Aortography', 'Blood Vessel Prosthesis Implantation', 'Humans', 'Postoperative Complications', 'Prosthesis Failure', 'Reoperation', 'Stents', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed', 'Treatment Failure']",11552381,"[['C14.907.055.050'], ['C14.907.055.239.075', 'C14.907.109.139.075'], ['E01.370.350.700.060.070', 'E01.370.370.050.070'], ['E04.100.814.868.500', 'E04.650.200'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C23.550.767'], ['C23.550.767.865', 'E05.325.771'], ['E04.690'], ['E07.695.750'], ['E01.370.350.350.810', 'E01.370.350.600.350.700.810', 'E01.370.350.700.700.810', 'E01.370.350.700.810.810', 'E01.370.350.825.810.810'], ['E01.789.800.760', 'N04.761.559.590.800.760', 'N05.715.360.575.575.800.760']]","['Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Health Care [N]']",0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
Negative regulation of bovine growth hormone gene by YY1 binding to NRE's.,"We have previously demonstrated the presence of three negative regulatory elements (NRE1, 2, and 3) in the upstream region of the bovine growth hormone (bGH) gene, whose sequences are similar to the binding elements of transcription factor YY1. The recombinant human YY1 protein indeed bound to these three NRE's in vitro, among which NRE1 is the strongest binding element. Both HeLa and rat pituitary GH3 nuclear extracts contained protein which caused the same retardation as YY1 binding in gel mobility shift assay. The specific band retarded by HeLa and GH3 nuclear extracts was competed out efficiently by a known YY1 binding element. Addition of antibodies against YY1 in the binding reaction produced a distinct supershifted band and/or caused reduction in the YY1-specific band. When the recombinant plasmids containing the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene under the control of the bGH promoter were introduced together with the expression vector for YY1 into HeLa cells, the expression of the bGH promoter decreased with increasing amount of cotransfecting YY1 expression vector. These results demonstrate that YY1 or its very close homolog negatively regulates bGH expression via binding to NRE's.","['Animals', 'Binding, Competitive', 'Cattle', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Erythroid-Specific DNA-Binding Factors', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Growth Hormone', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Nuclear Proteins', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Binding', 'Rats', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Transcription Factors', 'YY1 Transcription Factor']",8941348,"[['B01.050'], ['E05.196.080', 'G02.111.084', 'G02.111.570.120.309'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.500.380.271'], ['D12.776.260'], ['D12.776.260.235', 'D12.776.930.216'], ['G05.308'], ['D06.472.699.631.525.425', 'D12.644.548.691.525.425'], ['A11.251.210.190.400', 'A11.251.860.180.400', 'A11.436.340'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D12.776.660'], ['G02.111.570.080.689.675', 'G05.360.080.689.675', 'G05.360.340.024.340.137.750.680'], ['G02.111.679', 'G03.808'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700'], ['D12.776.828'], ['D12.776.930'], ['D12.776.260.235.875', 'D12.776.930.216.875']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Could clinical decision rules relying on cardiovascular risk models increase psychosocial inequalities in health? Results from the PRIME cohort study.,"OBJECTIVE: Guidelines on cardiovascular prevention relying on common cardiovascular risk scoring could result in delayed drug therapy for patients with low psychosocial status because of underestimation of true cardiovascular risk. We aimed to assess the potential delay in drug therapy for subjects with adverse psychosocial factors.METHOD: The study population consisted of 6185 French men from the PRIME (Prospective Epidemiological Study of Myocardial Infarction) cohort study (1991-2003). The number of extra years to reach a risk threshold for subjects without adverse psychosocial factor compared to subject with adverse psychosocial factor was estimated using a coronary risk model including biomedical factors and a psychosocial variable (education, occupation, living conditions or a depression score).RESULTS: Coronary risk was significantly higher only for subjects with a high depression score (odds ratio=1.34; 95% confidence interval 1.04, 1.72) or low educational attainment (odds ratio=1.39; 95% confidence interval=1.07, 1.81). For a given risk threshold, subjects with high depression scores were 4.5 years (95% confidence interval=0.0, 15.4 years) younger than subjects with low depression scores. The age difference was 4.1 years (95% confidence interval=-0.5, 15.8 years) between subjects with low and high educational attainment.CONCLUSION: Clinical decision rules relying on classic cardiovascular risk scoring could result in delayed drug therapy for patients with depression or low educational attainment.","['Age Factors', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cohort Studies', 'Comorbidity', 'Decision Making', 'Depression', 'France', 'Health Status Disparities', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Models, Cardiovascular', 'Risk Assessment', 'Social Class', 'Time Factors']",21540049,"[['N05.715.350.075', 'N06.850.490.250'], ['C14'], ['E05.318.372.500.750', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750'], ['N05.715.350.225', 'N06.850.490.687'], ['F02.463.785.373'], ['F01.145.126.350'], ['Z01.542.286'], ['I01.240.425.675', 'N01.224.425.437', 'N06.850.505.400.425.675'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['E05.599.395.161'], ['E05.318.740.600.800.715', 'N04.452.871.715', 'N05.715.360.750.625.700.690', 'N06.850.505.715', 'N06.850.520.830.600.800.715'], ['I01.880.853.996.755', 'N01.824.782'], ['G01.910.857']]","['Health Care [N]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",0,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1

In this paper, macros was written by using SAS 9.4 and the contrast ratio, attributable proportion due to interaction and synergy index were calculated while calculating the items of logistic and Cox regression interactions, and the confidence intervals of Wald, delta and profile likelihood were used to evaluate additive interaction for the reference in big data analysis in clinical epidemiology and in analysis of genetic multiplicative and additive interactions.","['Case-Control Studies', 'Humans', 'Logistic Models', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Survival Analysis']",27188374,"[['E05.318.372.500.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.500'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E05.318.740.500.525', 'E05.318.740.600.800.450', 'E05.318.740.750.450', 'E05.599.835.875', 'N05.715.360.750.530.480', 'N05.715.360.750.625.700.450', 'N05.715.360.750.695.470', 'N06.850.520.830.500.525', 'N06.850.520.830.600.800.450', 'N06.850.520.830.750.450'], ['E05.318.740.500.700', 'E05.318.740.600.700', 'E05.318.740.750.725', 'E05.318.740.998.825', 'E05.599.835.900', 'N05.715.360.750.530.650', 'N05.715.360.750.625.650', 'N05.715.360.750.695.650', 'N05.715.360.750.795.825', 'N06.850.520.830.500.700', 'N06.850.520.830.600.700', 'N06.850.520.830.750.725', 'N06.850.520.830.998.912'], ['E05.318.740.998', 'N05.715.360.750.795', 'N06.850.520.830.998']]","['Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]']",0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
Socioeconomic differences in the burden of disease in Sweden.,"OBJECTIVE: We sought to analyse how much of the total burden of disease in Sweden, measured in disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), is a result of inequalities in health between socioeconomic groups. We also sought to determine how this unequal burden is distributed across different disease groups and socioeconomic groups.METHODS: Our analysis used data from the Swedish Burden of Disease Study. We studied all Swedish men and women in three age groups (15-44, 45-64, 65-84) and five major socioeconomic groups. The 18 disease and injury groups that contributed to 65% of the total burden of disease were analysed using attributable fractions and the slope index of inequality and the relative index of inequality.FINDINGS: About 30% of the burden of disease among women and 37% of the burden among men is a differential burden resulting from socioeconomic inequalities in health. A large part of this unequally distributed burden falls on unskilled manual workers. The largest contributors to inequalities in health for women are ischaemic heart disease, depression and neurosis, and stroke. For men, the largest contributors are ischaemic heart disease, alcohol addiction and self-inflicted injuries.CONCLUSION: This is the first study to use socioeconomic differences, measured by socioeconomic position, to assess the burden of disease using DALYs. We found that in Sweden one-third of the burden of the diseases we studied is unequally distributed. Studies of socioeconomic inequalities in the burden of disease that take both mortality and morbidity into account can help policy-makers understand the magnitude of inequalities in health for different disease groups.","['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cost of Illness', 'Depression', 'Disabled Persons', 'Disease', 'Female', 'Health Status Disparities', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms', 'Quality-Adjusted Life Years', 'Social Class', 'Sweden']",15744401,"[['M01.060.057'], ['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['M01.060.116.100.080'], ['C14'], ['N03.219.151.165', 'N05.715.360.300.800.438.375.182', 'N06.850.520.308.980.438.475.046'], ['F01.145.126.350'], ['M01.150'], ['C23.550.288'], ['I01.240.425.675', 'N01.224.425.437', 'N06.850.505.400.425.675'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['C04'], ['E05.318.740.100.500.700', 'N01.224.935.530.700'], ['I01.880.853.996.755', 'N01.824.782'], ['Z01.542.816.500']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Geographicals [Z]']",0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1
Multisite effectiveness trials of treatments for substance abuse and co-occurring problems: have we chosen the best designs?,"Multisite effectiveness trials such as those carried out in the National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network (CTN) are a critical step in the development and dissemination of evidence-based treatments because they address how such treatments perform in real-world clinical settings. As Brigham et al. summarized in a recent article (G. S. Brigham, D. J. Feaster, P. G. Wakim, & C. L. Dempsey C. L., 2009), several possible experimental designs may be chosen for such effectiveness trials. These include (a) a new treatment intervention (Tx) is compared to an existing mode of community based treatment as usual (TAU): Tx versus TAU; (b) a new intervention is added to TAU and compared to TAU alone: Tx + TAU versus TAU; or (c) a new intervention is added to TAU and compared to a control condition added to TAU: Tx + TAU versus control + TAU. Each of these designs addresses a different question and has different potential strengths and weaknesses. As of December 2009, the primary outcome paper had been published for 16 of the multisite randomized clinical trials conducted in the CTN, testing various treatments for drug abuse, HIV risk behavior, or related problems. This paper systematically examines, for each of the completed trials, the experimental design type chosen and its original rationale, the main findings of the trial, and the strengths and weaknesses of the design in hindsight. Based on this review, recommendations are generated to inform the design of future effectiveness trials on treatments for substance abuse, HIV risk, and other behavioral health problems.","['Community Health Services', 'Comparative Effectiveness Research', 'Evidence-Based Medicine', 'Humans', 'Information Dissemination', 'National Institute on Drug Abuse (U.S.)', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Research Design', 'Substance Abuse Treatment Centers', 'Substance-Related Disorders', 'Treatment Outcome', 'United States']",20307801,"[['N02.421.143'], ['H01.770.644.145.360.500', 'N05.425.157'], ['H02.249.750', 'H02.403.200.400'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['L01.143.443'], ['I01.409.418.750.600.650.496.485', 'N03.540.052.750.485', 'N03.540.348.500.500.600.650.496.485'], ['E05.318.372.250.250.365.500', 'N05.715.360.330.250.250.365.500', 'N06.850.520.450.250.250.365.500'], ['E05.581.500', 'H01.770.644.728'], ['N02.278.035.128.800', 'N02.278.808.930'], ['C25.775', 'F03.900'], ['E01.789.800', 'N04.761.559.590.800', 'N05.715.360.575.575.800'], ['Z01.107.567.875']]","['Health Care [N]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Geographicals [Z]']",0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,1
Expression of platelet-bound stromal cell-derived factor-1 in  patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation and ischemic heart  disease.,"AIMS: Blood cell infiltration and inflammation are involved in atrial remodelling during atrial fibrillation (AF) although the exact mechanisms of inflammatory cell recruitment remain poorly understood. Platelet-bound stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1) is increased in cases of ischemic myocardium and regulates recruitment of CXCR4(+) cells on the vascular wall. Whether platelet-bound SDF-1 expression is differentially influenced by non-valvular paroxysmal or permanent atrial fibrillation (AF) in patients with stable angina pectoris (SAP) or acute coronary syndrome (ACS) has not been reported so far.METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 1291 consecutive patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) undergoing coronary angiography were recruited. Among the patients with SAP, platelet-bound-SDF-1 is increased in patients with paroxysmal AF compared with SR or to persistent/permanent AF (P < 0.05 for both). Platelet-bound SDF-1 correlated with plasma SDF-1 (r = 0.488, P = 0.013) in patients with AF and ACS, which was more pronounced among patients with persistent AF (r = 0.842, P = 0.009). Plasma SDF-1 was increased in persistent/permanent AF compared with SR. Patients with ACS presented with enhanced platelet-bound-SDF-1 compared with SAP. Interestingly, among patients with ACS, patients with paroxysmal or persistent/permanent AF presented with an impaired platelet-bound SDF-1 expression compared with patients with SR.CONCLUSIONS: Differential expression of platelet-bound and plasma SDF-1 was observed in patients with AF compared with SR which may be involved in progenitor cell mobilization and inflammatory cell recruitment in patients with AF and ischemic heart disease. Further in vivo studies are required to elucidate the role of SDF-1 in atrial remodeling and the atrial fibrillation course.","['Angina, Stable', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Blood Platelets', 'Cell Movement', 'Chemokine CXCL12', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Myocardial Ischemia', 'Stem Cells']",22044645,"[['C14.280.647.187.362', 'C14.907.585.187.362', 'C23.888.592.612.233.500.575'], ['C14.280.067.198', 'C23.550.073.198'], ['A11.118.188', 'A15.145.229.188'], ['G04.198', 'G07.568.500.180'], ['D12.644.276.374.200.120.600', 'D12.776.467.374.200.120.600', 'D23.125.300.120.600', 'D23.469.200.120.600', 'D23.529.374.200.120.600'], ['G05.308'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C14.280.647', 'C14.907.585'], ['A11.872']]","['Diseases [C]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]']",1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Ultrasonographic assessment of colonic wall in moderate-severe ulcerative colitis: comparison with endoscopic findings.,"BACKGROUND: Bowel ultrasound has been shown to be a useful tool to evaluate patients with inflammatory bowel disease, especially Crohn's disease. However, such data are still scarce in ulcerative colitis patients.AIMS: To establish the value of bowel ultrasound in moderate to severe ulcerative colitis patients, and compare these data with endoscopic findings.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Endoscopic, ultrasound and C-reactive protein data from 51 patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis observed during a 3-year period were retrospectively obtained and analysed.RESULTS: All patients displayed pathological thickness (>4 mm) of the colon wall. This value strongly correlated with C-reactive protein values (p=0.0001) and the endoscopic score (p<0.0001). Also, a strong correlation (p<0.0001) was found between CRP values and endoscopic score.CONCLUSIONS: Bowel ultrasound, in expert hands, may represent a useful adjunctive (or first line) tool for the evaluation of patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis.","['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'C-Reactive Protein', 'Colitis, Ulcerative', 'Colon', 'Colonoscopy', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Ultrasonography', 'Young Adult']",21482208,"[['M01.060.057'], ['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['D12.776.034.145', 'D12.776.124.050.120', 'D12.776.124.486.157'], ['C06.405.205.265.231', 'C06.405.205.731.249', 'C06.405.469.158.188.231', 'C06.405.469.432.249'], ['A03.556.124.526.356', 'A03.556.249.249.356'], ['E01.370.372.250.250.200', 'E01.370.388.250.250.250.160', 'E04.210.240.250.160', 'E04.502.250.250.250.160'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['E05.318.372.500.500.500', 'E05.318.372.500.750.750', 'N05.715.360.330.500.500.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.825', 'N06.850.520.450.500.500.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.825'], ['E05.318.308.980.438.475.456.500', 'N05.715.360.300.800.438.375.364.500', 'N06.850.520.308.980.438.475.364.500'], ['E01.370.350.850'], ['M01.060.116.815']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Health Care [N]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
Acid-Labile Amphiphilic PEO-b-PPO-b-PEO Copolymers: Degradable Poloxamer Analogs.,"Poly ((ethylene oxide)-b-(propylene oxide)-b-(ethylene oxide)) triblock copolymers commonly known as poloxamers or Pluronics constitute an important class of nonionic, biocompatible surfactants. Here, a method is reported to incorporate two acid-labile acetal moieties in the backbone of poloxamers to generate acid-cleavable nonionic surfactants. Poly(propylene oxide) is functionalized by means of an acetate-protected vinyl ether to introduce acetal units. Three cleavable PEO-PPO-PEO triblock copolymers (Mn,total = 6600, 8000, 9150 g·mol(-1) ; Mn,PEO = 2200, 3600, 4750 g·mol(-1) ) have been synthesized using anionic ring-opening polymerization. The amphiphilic copolymers exhibit narrow molecular weight distributions (? = 1.06-1.08). Surface tension measurements reveal surface-active behavior in aqueous solution comparable to established noncleavable poloxamers. Complete hydrolysis of the labile junctions after acidic treatment is verified by size exclusion chromatography. The block copolymers have been employed as surfactants in a miniemulsion polymerization to generate polystyrene (PS) nanoparticles with mean diameters of ?200 nm and narrow size distribution, as determined by dynamic light scattering and scanning electron microscopy.

"[Mechanical versus drug prevention of thrombosis after total hip endoprosthesis implantation. A randomized, controlled clinical study].","Pharmacological prophylaxis is routinely applied after total hip replacement. Although it effectively reduces deep-vein thrombosis, side effects (bleeding, haematoma, swelling, thrombocytopenia) are not infrequent. Since in Germany use of foot pumps as only means of prophylaxis is unpopular, we investigated their efficacy and safety in a randomized study. 106 patients used either low molecular weight heparin (Fraxiparin, Sanofi-Synthelabo, Germany) or the foot-pump (A-V Impulse System, Orthofix, M?hltal, Germany), and were monitored for deep-vein thrombosis using serial duplex sonography on postoperative days 4, 12 and 45. Clinical observations included daily measurements of thigh circumference, recording of postoperative drainage amounts, and monitoring of wound healing. None of the 50 patients treated with the foot-pump developed deep-vein thrombosis, while 4 of the 50 patients (8 per cent) on pharmacological prophylaxis did so. Six patients stopped using the foot-pump during the study. One patient developed heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. Patients on mechanical prophylaxis had smaller amounts of drainage (mean 247 ml vs. 272 ml, p = 0.485) and significantly less swelling of the thigh (10 mm compared with 15 mm, p or = < 0.001), The good results in terms of prevention of thromboembolic complications and soft tissue swelling favour the general use of foot pumps as mechanical prophylaxis.","['Adult', 'Aged', 'Anticoagulants', 'Arthroplasty, Replacement, Hip', 'Bandages', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nadroparin', 'Outcome and Process Assessment, Health Care', 'Physical Therapy Modalities', 'Postoperative Complications', 'Pulmonary Embolism', 'Thrombocytopenia', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Ultrasonography, Doppler, Color', 'Venous Thrombosis']",12910861,"[['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['D27.505.954.502.119'], ['E04.555.110.110.110', 'E04.650.110.110', 'E04.680.101.110.110'], ['E07.101'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['D09.698.373.400.300.600'], ['N04.761.559', 'N05.715.360.575'], ['E02.779', 'E02.831.535'], ['C23.550.767'], ['C08.381.746', 'C14.907.355.350.700'], ['C15.378.140.855'], ['E01.789.800', 'N04.761.559.590.800', 'N05.715.360.575.575.800'], ['E01.370.350.850.850.850.850'], ['C14.907.355.830.925']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Diseases [C]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
Healthcare-associated infections are associated with insufficient dietary intake: an observational cross-sectional study.,"BACKGROUND: Indicators to predict healthcare-associated infections (HCAI) are scarce. Malnutrition is known to be associated with adverse outcomes in healthcare but its identification is time-consuming and rarely done in daily practice. This cross-sectional study assessed the association between dietary intake, nutritional risk, and the prevalence of HCAI, in a general hospital population.METHODS AND FINDINGS: Dietary intake was assessed by dedicated dieticians on one day for all hospitalized patients receiving three meals per day. Nutritional risk was assessed using Nutritional Risk Screening (NRS)-2002, and defined as a NRS score ? 3. Energy needs were calculated using 110% of Harris-Benedict formula. HCAIs were diagnosed based on the Center for Disease Control criteria and their association with nutritional risk and measured energy intake was done using a multivariate logistic regression analysis. From 1689 hospitalised patients, 1024 and 1091 were eligible for the measurement of energy intake and nutritional risk, respectively. The prevalence of HCAI was 6.8%, and 30.1% of patients were at nutritional risk. Patients with HCAI were more likely identified with decreased energy intake (i.e. ? 70% of predicted energy needs) (30.3% vs. 14.5%, P = 0.002). The proportion of patients at nutritional risk was not significantly different between patients with and without HCAI (35.6% vs.29.7%, P = 0.28), respectively. Measured energy intake ? 70% of predicted energy needs (odds ratio: 2.26; 95% CI: 1.24 to 4.11, P = 0.008) and moderate severity of the disease (odds ratio: 3.38; 95% CI: 1.49 to 7.68, P = 0.004) were associated with HCAI in the multivariate analysis.CONCLUSION: Measured energy intake ? 70% of predicted energy needs is associated with HCAI in hospitalised patients. This suggests that insufficient dietary intake could be a risk factor of HCAI, without excluding reverse causality. Randomized trials are needed to assess whether improving energy intake in patients identified with decreased dietary intake could be a novel strategy for HCAI prevention.","['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cross Infection', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Energy Intake', 'Female', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals, General', 'Humans', 'Logistic Models', 'Male', 'Malnutrition', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Nutrition Assessment', 'Odds Ratio', 'Risk Factors', 'Severity of Illness Index']",25923783,"[['M01.060.116.100'], ['M01.060.116.100.080'], ['C01.248', 'C23.550.291.875.500'], ['E05.318.372.500.875', 'N05.715.360.330.500.875', 'N06.850.520.450.500.875'], ['G07.203.650.240.340'], ['E02.760.400', 'N02.421.585.400'], ['N02.278.421.389'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E05.318.740.500.525', 'E05.318.740.600.800.450', 'E05.318.740.750.450', 'E05.599.835.875', 'N05.715.360.750.530.480', 'N05.715.360.750.625.700.450', 'N05.715.360.750.695.470', 'N06.850.520.830.500.525', 'N06.850.520.830.600.800.450', 'N06.850.520.830.750.450'], ['C18.654.521'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['E05.318.740.150.500', 'N05.715.360.750.125.500', 'N06.850.520.830.150.500'], ['E05.318.308.585', 'N05.715.360.300.560', 'N06.850.505.557', 'N06.850.520.308.585'], ['E05.318.740.600.600', 'G17.680.500', 'N05.715.360.750.625.590', 'N06.850.520.830.600.600'], ['E05.318.740.600.800.725', 'N05.715.350.200.700', 'N05.715.360.750.625.700.700', 'N06.850.490.625.750', 'N06.850.520.830.600.800.725'], ['E05.318.308.980.438.475.456.500', 'N05.715.360.300.800.438.375.364.500', 'N06.850.520.308.980.438.475.364.500']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]']",0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
Prevalence and impact of urinary incontinence in men with cystic fibrosis.,"OBJECTIVES: To determine the prevalence and impact of urinary incontinence (UI) in men with cystic fibrosis (CF).DESIGN: Prospective observational study.SETTING: Adult CF clinics at tertiary referral centres.PARTICIPANTS: Men with CF (n=80) and age-matched men without lung disease (n=80).INTERVENTIONS: Validated questionnaires to identify the prevalence and impact of UI.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Prevalence of UI and relationship to disease specific factors, relationship of UI with anxiety and depression.RESULTS: The prevalence of UI was higher in men with CF (15%) compared to controls (10%) (p=0.339). Men with CF and UI had higher scores for anxiety than those without UI (mean 9.1 (SD 4.8) vs 4.7 (4.1), p=0.003), with similar findings for depression (6.8 (4.6) vs 2.8 (3.4), p=0.002) using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale.CONCLUSIONS: Incontinence is more prevalent in adult men with CF than age matched controls, and may have an adverse effect on mental health.

Interaction of plasma membrane fibronectin receptor with talin--a transmembrane linkage.,"Many observations suggest the presence of transmembrane linkages between the cytoskeleton and the extracellular matrix. In fibroblasts both light and electron microscopic observations reveal a co-alignment between actin filaments at the cell surface and extracellular fibronectin. These associations are seen at sites of cell matrix interaction, frequently along stress fibres and sometimes where these bundles of microfilaments terminate at adhesion plaques (focal contacts). Non-morphological evidence also indicates a functional linkage between the cytoskeleton and extracellular matrix. Addition of fibronectin to transformed cells induces flattening of the cells and a reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton, with the concomitant appearance of arrays of stress fibres. Conversely, disruption of the actin cytoskeleton by treatment with cytochalasin B leads to release of fibronectin from the cell surface. As yet, there is no detailed knowledge of the molecules involved in this transmembrane linkage, although several proteins have been suggested as candidates in the chain of attachment between bundles of actin filaments and the cytoplasmic face of the plasma membrane: these include vinculin, alpha-actinin and talin, each one having been identified at regions where bundles of actin filaments interact with the plasma membrane and underlying cell-surface fibronectin. Recently, the cell-substrate attachment (CSAT) antigen has been identified as a plasma membrane receptor for fibronectin, raising the possibility that this glycoprotein complex may serve as a bridge between fibronectin and one or more of the underlying cytoskeletal components mentioned. Here we have investigated the interaction of the purified CSAT antigen with these cytoskeletal components, and we demonstrate an interaction specifically between the CSAT antigen and talin.","['Animals', 'Cell Membrane', 'Chickens', 'Chromatography, Gel', 'Molecular Weight', 'Muscle Proteins', 'Receptors, Fibronectin', 'Receptors, Immunologic', 'Talin', 'Vinculin']",2938015,"[['B01.050'], ['A11.284.149'], ['B01.050.150.900.248.350.150', 'B01.050.150.900.248.690.192'], ['E05.196.181.400.250'], ['G02.494'], ['D12.776.210.500'], ['D12.776.543.750.705.408.530'], ['D12.776.543.750.705'], ['D12.776.220.985'], ['D12.776.220.990']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

"Structure of the bovine VASAP-60/PRKCSH gene, functional analysis of the promoter, and gene expression analysis.","Vacuolar system-associated protein-60 (VASAP-60) constitutes the bovine ortholog of the human ""protein kinase C substrate 80K-H"" (PRKCSH or 80K-H). We characterized the bovine VASAP-60/PRKCSH gene structure and promoter, identified cis-acting elements controlling VASAP-60 expression, searched for mRNA splice variants, and analyzed mRNA expression in ovarian follicles. Expression of VASAP-60 mRNA showed a 2.4-fold increase (P<0.0001) in granulosa cells of dominant follicles compared to small follicles (2-4 mm) or ovulatory follicles, and no mRNA splice variant was identified. The bovine VASAP-60 gene encompasses 12.5 kb and is composed of 18 exons and 17 introns. Primer extension analysis revealed a single transcription initiation site, and the promoter lacks a TATA box. Promoter activity assays were performed with a series of deletion constructs in different bovine cell lines (endometrial epithelial glandular, kidney epithelial and aortic endothelial) to identify cis-acting elements. The -53/+16 bp fragment (+1 = transcription start site) conferred minimal promoter activity whereas activator and repressor elements were located in the -200/-53 bp and -653/-200 bp fragments, respectively. Analysis of cis-acting elements in the -200/-53 bp activation domain revealed by gel shift assays and chromatin immunoprecipitation assay that transcription factor YY1 binds to VASAP-60 promoter. This study is the first to report that VASAP-60 is up-regulated in granulosa cells of dominant follicles, to document the primary structure of the bovine VASAP-60 gene and promoter, and to demonstrate that YY1 binds to the VASAP-60 proximal promoter and may act as a positive transcriptional regulator.","['Alternative Splicing', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cattle', 'Cell Line', 'Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay', 'Exons', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Granulosa Cells', 'Introns', 'Luciferases', 'Male', 'Membrane Proteins', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Ovarian Follicle', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Binding', 'RNA, Messenger', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', 'Transcription Initiation Site', 'YY1 Transcription Factor']",17250974,"[['G02.111.760.700.100', 'G03.839.700.100', 'G05.308.700.700.100'], ['G02.111.570.060', 'L01.453.245.667.060'], ['B01.050'], ['G02.111.570.080', 'G05.360.080', 'L01.453.245.667.080'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.500.380.271'], ['A11.251.210'], ['E05.196.401.500'], ['G05.360.340.024.340.137.232'], ['E05.393.332'], ['A05.360.319.114.630.535.200', 'A06.300.312.497.535.300', 'A11.382.812', 'A11.436.329'], ['G05.360.340.024.220.400', 'G05.360.340.024.340.137.515'], ['D08.811.682.517', 'D12.776.532.510'], ['D12.776.543'], ['L01.453.245.667'], ['A05.360.319.114.630.535', 'A06.300.312.497.535'], ['G02.111.570.080.689.675', 'G05.360.080.689.675', 'G05.360.340.024.340.137.750.680'], ['G02.111.679', 'G03.808'], ['D13.444.735.544'], ['E05.393.620.500.725'], ['G02.111.810.200', 'G05.810.200'], ['G02.111.810.550', 'G05.810.550'], ['G05.360.340.024.340.137.750.840'], ['D12.776.260.235.875', 'D12.776.930.216.875']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
In silico prediction and in vivo analysis of antiestrogenic potential of 2-isopropylthioxanthone (2-ITX) in juvenile goldfish (Carassius auratus).,"Previous studies have shown both anti-estrogenic and anti-androgenic activities of 2-isopropylthioxanthone (2-ITX), a well known food contaminant, in in vitro assays. However, no data are available on the anti-estrogenic potentials and risks of 2-ITX in aquatic organisms. This work evaluated the potential endocrine disrupting effects of 2-ITX at the level of estrogen receptor (ER) signaling cascade using juvenile goldfish (Carassius auratus) as model. Firstly, we investigated the ligand binding efficiency of 2-ITX to the ligand binding domains (LBD) of goldfish ER subtypes using a molecular docking approach. Secondly, we assessed the effects of 2-ITX on E2-induced hepatic expression of ERá1, ERâ1, ERâ2, and vitellogenin (VTG) in vivo. Crosstalk between ER-VTG and aryl hydrocarbon receptor 2 (AhR2)-cytochrome P4501A (CYP1A) was also investigated. Fish were injected with increasing doses of 2-ITX ranging from 2 to 10µg/g BW, and results were compared to the effect of tamoxifen, a well-known ER modulator. We observed that compared to ERâ, the interaction potentials of 2-ITX to goldfish ERá1 LBD was more stable in the inactive receptor conformation. The in silico docking simulation analysis also revealed that 2-ITX acted as agonist for the goldfish AhR2 LBDs suggesting the ability of this compound to activate the cross-talk between the ERá- and AhR-signaling pathways. In vivo experiments confirm in silico simulation predictions demonstrating that 2-ITX reduced the estrogenicity of E2 at both transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels, indicating a clear anti-estrogenic effect. Co-exposure of E2 and 2-ITX also resulted in a significant decrease of CYP1A gene expression with respect to 2-ITX alone. Results from these studies collectively revealed that the antiestrogenic property of 2-ITX can be ascribed to a combination of effects on multiple signaling pathways suggesting the potential for this environmental contaminant to affect the hormonal control of reproductive processes in fish.","['Adolescent', 'Animals', 'Computer Simulation', 'Endocrine Disruptors', 'Estrogen Antagonists', 'Estrogen Receptor alpha', 'Gene Expression', 'Goldfish', 'Humans', 'Liver', 'Molecular Docking Simulation', 'Receptors, Aryl Hydrocarbon', 'Thioxanthenes', 'Vitellogenins']",27454205,"[['M01.060.057'], ['B01.050'], ['L01.224.160'], ['D27.505.696.353', 'D27.888.141'], ['D06.347.295', 'D27.505.696.399.450.327'], ['D12.776.826.750.350.174'], ['G05.297'], ['B01.050.150.900.493.200.244.248.480'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['A03.620'], ['E05.599.595.249', 'L01.224.160.249'], ['D12.776.260.643.715', 'D12.776.826.209.715', 'D12.776.930.760'], ['D02.886.952', 'D03.633.300.953.704'], ['D12.776.093.500.925', 'D12.776.290.812.500', 'D12.776.744.925']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0
"GSTM1, GSTT1, GSTP1, CYP1A1, and NAT1 polymorphisms, tobacco use, and the risk of head and neck cancer.","Squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN), including the oral cavity, pharynx, and larynx, provides an ideal tumor model to investigate gene-environment interaction. We conducted a hospital-based case-control study including 182 cases with newly diagnosed SCCHN and 202 controls with nonneoplastic conditions of the head and neck that required surgery. Lifetime tobacco use and risk of SCCHN were evaluated in relation to the polymorphisms of GSTM1, GSTT1, GSTP1, CYP1A1, and NAT1. The main effects of genotype were associated with a slightly increased risk of SCCHN for GSTP1 [age-, race-, and sex-adjusted odds ratio (OR), 1.2; confidence interval (CI), 0.8-1.9], GSTT1 (OR, 1.2; CI, 0.7-2.3), and NAT1 (OR, 1.1; CI, 0.7-1.7). The joint effects of genotype combinations showed some excess risk for the combination of the GSTM1 null genotype and the CYP1A1 Ile/Val polymorphism (OR, 2.6; CI, 0.7-10.3). The analysis of the joint effects (interaction) of the ""at-risk"" genotypes and tobacco use did not reveal any interaction on either the multiplicative or additive scale for GSTM1, GSTP1, or CYP1A1. However, there was a suggestion of an interaction on the additive scale between the pack-years of tobacco use and the GSTT1 null genotype. The combined heterozygote and homozygote NAT1*10 genotypes also had a suggestive interaction with tobacco smoking history. The results of this study suggest a possible gene-environment interaction for certain carcinogen metabolizing enzymes, but larger studies that fully evaluate the interaction are needed.","['Acetyltransferases', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Arylamine N-Acetyltransferase', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A1', 'Female', 'Glutathione Transferase', 'Head and Neck Neoplasms', 'Humans', 'Isoenzymes', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Risk Factors', 'Smoking']",10698480,"[['D08.811.913.050.134'], ['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['D08.811.913.050.134.138'], ['C04.557.470.200.400', 'C04.557.470.700.400'], ['E05.318.372.500.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.500'], ['D08.244.453.005.332', 'D08.244.453.100.500', 'D08.811.682.690.708.170.010.277', 'D08.811.682.690.708.170.020.500', 'D12.776.422.220.453.010.332', 'D12.776.422.220.453.100.500'], ['D08.811.913.225.500'], ['C04.588.443'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D08.811.348', 'D12.776.800.300'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['G05.365.795'], ['E05.318.740.600.800.725', 'N05.715.350.200.700', 'N05.715.360.750.625.700.700', 'N06.850.490.625.750', 'N06.850.520.830.600.800.725'], ['F01.145.805']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]']",0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
Does seeing an Asian face make speech sound more accented?,"Prior studies have reported that seeing an Asian face makes American English sound more accented. The current study investigates whether this effect is perceptual, or if it instead occurs at a later decision stage. We first replicated the finding that showing static Asian and Caucasian faces can shift people's reports about the accentedness of speech accompanying the pictures. When we changed the static pictures to dubbed videos, reducing the demand characteristics, the shift in reported accentedness largely disappeared. By including unambiguous items along with the original ambiguous items, we introduced a contrast bias and actually reversed the shift, with the Asian-face videos yielding lower judgments of accentedness than the Caucasian-face videos. By changing to a mixed rather than blocked design, so that the ethnicity of the videos varied from trial to trial, we eliminated the difference in accentedness rating. Finally, we tested participants' perception of accented speech using the selective adaptation paradigm. After establishing that an auditory-only accented adaptor shifted the perception of how accented test words are, we found that no such adaptation effect occurred when the adapting sounds relied on visual information (Asian vs. Caucasian videos) to influence the accentedness of an ambiguous auditory adaptor. Collectively, the results demonstrate that visual information can affect the interpretation, but not the perception, of accented speech.","['Acoustic Stimulation', 'Adaptation, Psychological', 'Adult', 'Asian Continental Ancestry Group', 'European Continental Ancestry Group', 'Face', 'Facial Recognition', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Male', 'Phonetics', 'Photic Stimulation', 'Speech', 'Speech Perception', 'Young Adult']",28516294,"[['E02.037', 'E02.190.888.030', 'E05.723.136'], ['F01.058'], ['M01.060.116'], ['M01.686.508.200'], ['M01.686.508.400'], ['A01.456.505'], ['F02.463.593.524.250.500', 'F02.463.593.524.500.500', 'F02.463.593.932.622.500'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['F01.145.209.399', 'L01.559'], ['F02.463.425', 'F02.784.629.529'], ['L01.559.598.518'], ['E05.723.729'], ['F01.145.209.908.677', 'G11.561.812', 'L01.559.423.676'], ['F02.463.593.071.875', 'G07.888.125.875'], ['M01.060.116.815']]","['Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0
Comparison of some postanaesthetic effects of atropine and glycopyrrolate with particular emphasis on urinary problems.,"Two hundred and two patients undergoing elective surgery were given either atropine (98 patients) or glycopyrrolate (104 patients) for intravenous premedication and as an adjunct to reversal of neuromuscular block by neostigmine in a double-blind study. The dose ratio of atropine and glycopyrrolate was 2.5:1. After reversal, both drugs induced an initial increase and a subsequent decrease in heart rate. The mean values in % heart rate were statistically significantly higher in the glycopyrrolate group than in the atropine group. Semiquantitative measurement of salivation showed glycopyrrolate to be more potent as an antisialogogue drug. Nausea and vomiting were equally common after both drugs. There were no differences between the drugs in the occurrence of postoperative micturition difficulties, the total rate of this complication being 18%. It is concluded that factors other than the choice of anticholinergic drug may be blamed for postoperative micturition difficulties.","['Adult', 'Atropine', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Female', 'Glycopyrrolate', 'Heart Rate', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nausea', 'Preanesthetic Medication', 'Pyrrolidines', 'Urinary Catheterization', 'Urination Disorders', 'Vomiting']",6711256,"[['M01.060.116'], ['D02.145.074.722.229.199', 'D03.132.760.180.572.199', 'D03.132.889.180.648.199', 'D03.605.084.500.722.229.199', 'D03.605.869.229.199'], ['E05.318.370.300', 'E05.581.500.300', 'N05.715.360.325.320', 'N06.850.520.445.300'], ['D02.092.877.425', 'D02.675.276.425', 'D03.383.773.342'], ['E01.370.600.875.500', 'G09.330.380.500'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['C23.888.821.712'], ['E03.806', 'E04.604.750.619'], ['D03.383.773'], ['E01.370.390.820', 'E02.148.947', 'E05.157.500'], ['C12.777.934', 'C13.351.968.934'], ['C23.888.821.937']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
In vitro studies of poison oak immunity. I. In vitro reaction of human lymphocytes to urushiol.,"Poison oak, ivy, and sumac dermatitis is a T-cell-mediated reaction against urushiol, the oil found in the leaf of the plants. This hapten is extremely lipophilic and concentrates in cell membranes. A blastogenesis assay employing peripheral blood lymphocytes obtained from humans sensitized to urushiol is described. The reactivity appears 1--3 wk after exposure and persists from 6 wk to 2 mon. The dose-response range is narrow, with inhibition occurring at higher antigen concentrations. Urushiol introduced into the in vitro culture on autologous lymphocytes, erythrocytes and heterologous erythrocytes produces equal results as measured by the optimal urushiol dose, the intensity of reaction, and the frequency of positive reactors. This suggests that the urushiol is passed from introducer to some other presenter cell. Although the blastogenically reactive cell is a T cell, there is also a requirement for an accessory cell, found in the non-T-cell population, for reactivity. Evidence is presented that this cell is a macrophage.","['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Alkenes', 'Binding Sites, Antibody', 'Catechols', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chemical Phenomena', 'Chemistry', 'Dermatitis, Contact', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Cellular', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Macrophages', 'Middle Aged', 'Oils', 'Plant Extracts', 'Plants, Toxic', 'T-Lymphocytes']",315414,[],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Ovulation induction with low-dose follicle-stimulating hormone in women with the polycystic ovary syndrome.,"Fifty infertile women with the polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) were treated for 66 cycles with low-dose FSH stimulation starting with 75 IU FSH for two weeks before eventual stepwise increases in the gonadotropin dose occurred. An unifollicular response was observed in 35 (53%) cycles and in 20 (30%) cycles there were two-three mature follicles. A multifollicular response (> 3 mature follicles) resulted in 11 (17%) cycles. One of the 66 cycles was complicated with the ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome. Twelve (22%) pregnancies were obtained following 55 completed cycles. All ongoing pregnancies were singleton gestations. The obese PCOS women required a longer period of stimulation and a higher amount of gonadotropin to achieve follicular maturation. However, there was no difference in cycle cancellation or pregnancy rate between obese and non-obese PCOS women. Thus low-dose FSH administration seems a safe stimulation regimen with a satisfactory conception rate in PCOS women.","['Adult', 'Female', 'Follicle Stimulating Hormone', 'Humans', 'Infertility, Female', 'Ovulation Induction', 'Polycystic Ovary Syndrome', 'Pregnancy', 'Treatment Outcome']",8382432,"[['M01.060.116'], ['D06.472.699.322.576.288', 'D06.472.699.631.525.343.288', 'D12.644.548.691.525.343.288'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C13.351.500.365.700'], ['E02.875.800.984', 'E05.820.800.984'], ['C04.182.612.765', 'C13.351.500.056.630.580.765', 'C19.391.630.580.765'], ['G08.686.784.769'], ['E01.789.800', 'N04.761.559.590.800', 'N05.715.360.575.575.800']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Health Care [N]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0

Organization of the sympathetic innervation in liver tissue from monkey and man.,"The sympathetic innervation of the liver of monkey and man has been investigated in a combined fluorescence histochemical, chemical and electron microscopical study. By means of the Falck-Hillarp fluorescence method a dense network of monoamine-containing nerve fibers was visualized in liver tissue of monkey and man. The nerve fibers ran in close contact to both hepatocytes and blood vessels. Chemical quantitations showed high concentrations of noradrenaline in both human and monkey liver. Microspectrofluorometry of the intraneuronal monoamine resulted in spectra characteristic of  a catecholamine. For the electron microscopical study the dopamine analogue, 5-hydroxydopamine, was used to ""label"" the catecholamine terminals in both human and monkey liver. The nerve profiles, identified as catecholamine-containing, were demonstrated in a perivascular location and in close contact to hepatocytes. No synaptic membrane specializations were present between nerve fibers and hepatocytes. The general ultramorphology and intralobular distribution pattern of nerves in the liver of monkey and man were similar. The present results prove the existence of a sympathetic innervation of hepatocytes and blood vessels in the liver of man and monkey.","['Animals', 'Chemical Phenomena', 'Chemistry', 'Haplorhini', 'Humans', 'Liver', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Norepinephrine', 'Spectrometry, Fluorescence', 'Sympathetic Nervous System']",103622,"[['B01.050'], ['G02'], ['H01.181'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['A03.620'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.199.120.510.550'], ['E01.370.350.515.458', 'E05.595.458'], ['D02.033.100.291.502', 'D02.092.063.480', 'D02.092.211.215.746', 'D02.092.311.830', 'D02.455.426.559.389.657.166.175.830'], ['E05.196.712.516.600.676', 'E05.196.867.726'], ['A08.800.050.800']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
Co-administration of the low dose of orexin and nitrergic antagonists induces an antidepressant-like effect in mice.,"It is now well-established that orexins (OXs) and their receptors are involved in the pathophysiology of depression. Considering the evidence indicating the importance of nitric oxide (NO) system in the mood modulation, this study investigated the effect of intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of orexin 1 (OX1) receptor antagonist -SB334867- alone or in combination with NO agents on depression using the forced swimming test (FST), tail suspension test (TST) and the number of crossings in open-field test (OFT) in mice. Our results indicated that administration of SB334867 at the dose of 0.5 mg/kg decreased the immobility time in the FST without effect on locomotor activity, suggesting an antidepressant-like effect of SB334867. Moreover, l-Arginine (a NO precursor; 750 mg/kg) or L-NAME (a non-selective nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitor, 10 mg/kg) administration by itself decreased the immobility time in the FST. Interestingly, co-administration of a sub-threshold dose of L-NAME, but not l-Arginine, in combination with an ineffective dose of SB334867 produced an antidepressant-like effect in the FST and TST. It should be noted, none of the drugs elicited significant effects on the locomotor activity in the OFT. Altogether, the present data propose that a combination of the sub-effective dose of OX and NO antagonists can be evaluated as an option for the clinical treatment of depression in humans.","['Animals', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Benzoxazoles', 'Depression', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Hindlimb Suspension', 'Locomotion', 'Male', 'Mice', 'NG-Nitroarginine Methyl Ester', 'Naphthyridines', 'Nitric Oxide', 'Orexins', 'Swimming', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Urea']",30399595,"[['B01.050'], ['D27.505.954.427.700.122'], ['D03.633.100.221'], ['F01.145.126.350'], ['G07.690.773.875', 'G07.690.936.500'], ['E02.319.310'], ['E05.472.760.370', 'E05.977.400', 'N06.230.150.440.950.400'], ['G07.568.500', 'G11.427.410.568'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500'], ['D12.125.068.050.525', 'D12.125.095.104.525'], ['D03.633.100.612'], ['D01.339.387', 'D01.625.550.500', 'D01.625.700.500', 'D01.650.550.587.600'], ['D12.644.400.360', 'D12.776.631.650.363'], ['G11.427.410.568.800', 'G11.427.410.698.277.875', 'I03.350.875', 'I03.450.642.845.945.500'], ['E01.789.800', 'N04.761.559.590.800', 'N05.715.360.575.575.800'], ['D02.065.950']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]']",0,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0
Polyethylenimine coated plasmid DNA-surfactant complexes as potential gene delivery systems.,"Nanometer scaled particles have been prepared from strong association between plasmid DNA (pcDNA3-FLAG-p53) and oppositely charged surfactants. Although these particles present suitable properties for gene delivery purposes, their cytotoxicity could compromise their use in gene therapy applications. To ensure biocompatibility of this potential gene delivery system, the nanoparticles were coated with polyethylenimine (PEI) with various molar ratios of PEI nitrogen to plasmid DNA phosphate groups. This led to a drastic increase in the cell viability of the particles, and in addition particle characteristics such as size, surface charge and loading efficiency, have also been enhanced as a result of the PEI coating process. The dissolution or swelling/deswelling behaviour displayed by these particulate vehicles could be tailored and monitored in time, to promote the controlled and sustained release of plasmid DNA. Moreover, we show that both the surfactant alkyl chain length and the ratio of nitrogen to phosphate groups are important parameters for controlling the plasmid DNA release. Overall, the developed plasmid DNA carriers have the potential as a new nanoplatform to be further explored for advances in the gene therapy field.","['DNA', 'Plasmids', 'Polyethyleneimine', 'Surface-Active Agents', 'Transfection']",26099970,"[['D13.444.308'], ['G05.360.600'], ['D02.455.326.271.665.550.600', 'D02.491.650', 'D05.750.716.507.600', 'D25.720.716.507.600', 'J01.637.051.720.716.507.600'], ['D27.720.877'], ['E05.393.350.810', 'G05.728.860']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
Comparison and optimization of in silico algorithms for predicting the pathogenicity of sodium channel variants in epilepsy.,"OBJECTIVE: Variants in neuronal voltage-gated sodium channel á-subunits genes SCN1A, SCN2A, and SCN8A are common in early onset epileptic encephalopathies and other autosomal dominant childhood epilepsy syndromes. However, in clinical practice, missense variants are often classified as variants of uncertain significance when missense variants are identified but heritability cannot be determined. Genetic testing reports often include results of computational tests to estimate pathogenicity and the frequency of that variant in population-based databases. The objective of this work was to enhance clinicians' understanding of results by (1) determining how effectively computational algorithms predict epileptogenicity of sodium channel (SCN) missense variants; (2) optimizing their predictive capabilities; and (3) determining if epilepsy-associated SCN variants are present in population-based databases. This will help clinicians better understand the results of indeterminate SCN test results in people with epilepsy.METHODS: Pathogenic, likely pathogenic, and benign variants in SCNs were identified using databases of sodium channel variants. Benign variants were also identified from population-based databases. Eight algorithms commonly used to predict pathogenicity were compared. In addition, logistic regression was used to determine if a combination of algorithms could better predict pathogenicity.RESULTS: Based on American College of Medical Genetic Criteria, 440 variants were classified as pathogenic or likely pathogenic and 84 were classified as benign or likely benign. Twenty-eight variants previously associated with epilepsy were present in population-based gene databases. The output provided by most computational algorithms had a high sensitivity but low specificity with an accuracy of 0.52-0.77. Accuracy could be improved by adjusting the threshold for pathogenicity. Using this adjustment, the Mendelian Clinically Applicable Pathogenicity (M-CAP) algorithm had an accuracy of 0.90 and a combination of algorithms increased the accuracy to 0.92.SIGNIFICANCE: Potentially pathogenic variants are present in population-based sources. Most computational algorithms overestimate pathogenicity; however, a weighted combination of several algorithms increased classification accuracy to >0.90.","['Algorithms', 'Computer Simulation', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Databases, Genetic', 'Epilepsy', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Variation', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Mutation, Missense', 'NAV1.1 Voltage-Gated Sodium Channel', 'NAV1.2 Voltage-Gated Sodium Channel', 'NAV1.6 Voltage-Gated Sodium Channel', 'Phenotype', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Sodium Channels']",28518218,"[['G17.035', 'L01.224.050'], ['L01.224.160'], ['E05.393.760.700.300'], ['L01.313.500.750.300.188.400.325', 'L01.470.750.750.325'], ['C10.228.140.490'], ['C23.550.291.687.500', 'G05.380.355'], ['G05.365'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.703'], ['G05.365.590.650'], ['D12.776.157.530.400.875.750.100', 'D12.776.543.550.450.875.750.100', 'D12.776.543.585.400.875.750.100', 'D12.776.631.960.100'], ['D12.776.157.530.400.875.750.200', 'D12.776.543.550.450.875.750.200', 'D12.776.543.585.400.875.750.200', 'D12.776.631.960.200'], ['D12.776.157.530.400.875.750.600', 'D12.776.543.550.450.875.750.600', 'D12.776.543.585.400.875.750.600', 'D12.776.631.960.600'], ['G05.695'], ['E05.318.370.800.650', 'N05.715.360.325.700.640', 'N06.850.520.445.800.650'], ['D12.776.157.530.400.875', 'D12.776.543.550.450.875', 'D12.776.543.585.400.875']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Health Care [N]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0
Early-life exposure to artificial light at night elevates physiological stress in free-living songbirds?,"Artificial light at night (ALAN) can disrupt adaptive patterns of physiology and behavior that promote high fitness, resulting in physiological stress and elevation of steroid glucocorticoids (corticosterone, CORT in birds). Elevated CORT may have particularly profound effects early in life, with the potential for enduring effects that persist into adulthood. Research on the consequences of early-life exposure to ALAN remains limited, especially outside of the laboratory, and whether light exposure affects CORT concentrations in wild nestling birds particularly remains to be elucidated. We used an experimental setup to test the hypothesis that ALAN elevates CORT concentrations in developing free-living birds, by exposing nestling great tits (Parus major) to ALAN inside nest boxes. We measured CORT in feathers grown over the timeframe of the experiment (7 nights), such that CORT concentrations represent an integrative metric of hormone release over the period of nocturnal light exposure, and of development. We also assessed the relationships between feather CORT concentrations, body condition, nestling size rank and fledging success. In addition, we evaluated the relationship between feather CORT concentrations and telomere length. Nestlings exposed to ALAN had higher feather CORT concentrations than control nestlings, and nestlings in poorer body condition and smaller brood members also had higher CORT. On the other hand, telomere length, fledging success, and recruitment rate were not significantly associated with light exposure or feather CORT concentrations. Results indicate that exposure to ALAN elevates CORT concentrations in nestlings, which may reflect physiological stress. In addition, the organizational effects of CORT are known to be substantial. Thus, despite the lack of an effect on telomere length and survivorship, elevated CORT concentrations in nestlings exposed to ALAN may have subsequent impacts on later-life fitness and stress sensitivity.","['Animals', 'Corticosterone', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Feathers', 'Light', 'Songbirds', 'Stress, Physiological']",31926393,"[['B01.050'], ['D04.210.500.745.745.654.237', 'D06.472.040.585.353.237'], ['N06.850.460.350'], ['A13.370'], ['G01.358.500.505.650', 'G01.590.540', 'G01.750.250.650', 'G01.750.770.578'], ['B01.050.150.900.248.620.750'], ['G07.775']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
Prostatic arterial embolization to treat benign prostatic hyperplasia.,"PURPOSE: To evaluate whether prostatic arterial embolization (PAE) might be a feasible procedure to treat lower urinary tract symptoms associated with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH).MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifteen patients (age range, 62-82 years; mean age, 74.1 y) with symptomatic BPH after failure of medical treatment were selected for PAE with nonspherical 200-ìm polyvinyl alcohol particles. The procedure was performed by a single femoral approach. Technical success was considered when selective prostatic arterial catheterization and embolization was achieved on at least one pelvic side.RESULTS: PAE was technically successful in 14 of the 15 patients (93.3%). There was a mean follow-up of 7.9 months (range, 3-12 months). International Prostate Symptom Score decreased a mean of 6.5 points (P = .005), quality of life improved 1.14 points (P = .065), International Index of Erectile Function increased 1.7 points (P = .063), and peak urinary flow increased 3.85 mL/sec (P = .015). There was a mean prostate-specific antigen reduction of 2.27 ng/mL (P = .072) and a mean prostate volume decrease of 26.5 mL (P = .0001) by ultrasound and 28.9 mL (P = .008) by magnetic resonance imaging. There was one major complication (a 1.5-cm(2) ischemic area of the bladder wall) and four clinical failures (28.6%).CONCLUSIONS: In this small group of patients, PAE was a feasible procedure, with preliminary results and short-term follow-up suggesting good symptom control without sexual dysfunction in suitable candidates, associated with a reduction in prostate volume.","['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Arteries', 'Biopsy', 'Embolization, Therapeutic', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Humans', 'Ischemia', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Organ Size', 'Penile Erection', 'Pilot Projects', 'Polyvinyl Alcohol', 'Portugal', 'Prospective Studies', 'Prostate', 'Prostate-Specific Antigen', 'Prostatic Hyperplasia', 'Quality of Life', 'Recovery of Function', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Ultrasonography', 'Urinary Bladder', 'Urodynamics']",21195898,"[['M01.060.116.100'], ['M01.060.116.100.080'], ['A07.015.114'], ['E01.370.225.500.384.100', 'E01.370.225.998.054', 'E01.370.388.100', 'E04.074', 'E05.200.500.384.100', 'E05.200.998.054', 'E05.242.384.100'], ['E02.520.360', 'E02.926.500'], ['E05.318.372.550', 'E05.337.675', 'N05.715.360.330.550', 'N06.850.520.450.550'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C23.550.513'], ['E01.370.350.825.500'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['E01.370.600.115.100.660', 'E05.041.124.715', 'G07.100.100.660', 'G07.345.249.690'], ['G08.686.784.717'], ['E05.318.372.750', 'E05.337.737', 'N05.715.360.330.720', 'N06.850.520.450.720'], ['D02.033.750', 'D02.455.326.271.884.533.532', 'D05.750.716.721.616', 'D25.720.716.721.616', 'J01.637.051.720.716.721.616'], ['Z01.542.727'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.625', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.650', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.650'], ['A05.360.444.575', 'A10.336.707'], ['D08.811.277.656.300.760.442.750', 'D08.811.277.656.959.350.442.750', 'D12.776.866.249.500', 'D23.050.285.625', 'D23.101.140.625'], ['C12.294.565.500'], ['I01.800', 'K01.752.400.750', 'N06.850.505.400.425.837'], ['G16.757'], ['G01.910.857'], ['E01.789.800', 'N04.761.559.590.800', 'N05.715.360.575.575.800'], ['E01.370.350.850'], ['A05.810.890'], ['G08.852.898']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Humanities [K]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1
[Plasma technologies in surgery of pulmonary echinococcosis].,"178 patients were operated over 18 years for pulmonary echinococcosis, 100 of them with standard methods, 78--with plasma technologies (surgical device SUPR-2M). Close echinococcectomy was performed in 22.5% patients, open--in 69.1%, combination of these operations--in 8.4% patients. Plasma technologies were used at pneumolysis, cysts section, antiparasitic treatment of residual cavities, fibrous capsule resection (pericystectomy) or cystpericystectomy, marginal resection of the lung with cyst, bronchotomy, sanation of pleural cavity, zone of operation and margins of operative wound. It is demonstrated that postoperative complications were seen in 34% patients operated by standard methods and in 8.9% patients operated with plasma technologies, lethal outcomes were in 2 (2%) and 1 (1.3%) patients, respectively. Plasma technologies permitted to reduce postoperative complications rate 3.8 times and postoperative treatment by 9.8 bed days or by 45.8%. Long-term results were studied in 61 (78.2%) operated patients followed from 1 month to 7 years, there were no recurrence of echinococcosis.","['Adult', 'Echinococcosis, Pulmonary', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Plasmapheresis', 'Pulmonary Medicine', 'Pulmonary Surgical Procedures', 'Thoracotomy']",11875944,"[['M01.060.116'], ['C01.610.335.190.396.480', 'C01.610.582.314', 'C01.748.450.314', 'C08.381.517.314', 'C08.730.450.314'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['E02.120.770', 'E02.912.715', 'E04.292.869'], ['H02.403.429.675'], ['E04.928.600'], ['E04.928.760']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]']",0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0
Adjustment of permissible exposure values to unusual work schedules.,"Research activities sought development of a method to adjust exposure limits for 694 substances for unusual work schedules. A consensus was established on the basic toxicological principle for adjustment; criteria for adjustment were selected by a panel of scientists coordinated by a committee of international experts and supported by toxicokinetic modeling; and a group of toxicologists attributed primary health effects and related adjustment category to each substance. A consensus among scientists and employers' and workers' representatives was established on the protocol of the application, in the field, of the adjusted exposure limits. The guiding toxicological principle for adjusting exposure standards to unusual work schedules is to guarantee an equivalent degree of protection for workers with unusual schedules as for workers with a conventional schedule of 8 hours per day, 5 days per week. The process of the adjustment is inspired from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration logic for attribution of primary health effects and adjustment categories ranging from no adjustment to daily or weekly adjustments. The adjusted exposure limits are calculated according to Haber's rule. Decisions on attribution of adjustment categories for the following toxicological effects were reached: respiratory sensitizers (asthma); skin sensitizers; tissue irritants versus tissue toxicants; methemoglobinenia-causing agents; cholinesterase inhibitors; and reproductive system toxicants and teratogens. A simple procedure is presented to facilitate the calculation, application, and interpretation of the adjusted exposure limits.","['Guideline Adherence', 'Hazardous Substances', 'Humans', 'Models, Theoretical', 'Occupational Medicine', 'Threshold Limit Values', 'Time Factors', 'Work Schedule Tolerance']",11669384,"[['N04.761.337', 'N05.715.360.395'], ['D27.888.426'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E05.599'], ['H02.403.720.750.510'], ['N03.706.615.917', 'N06.850.460.350.600.807'], ['G01.910.857'], ['I03.946.225.375', 'N04.452.677.650.375']]","['Health Care [N]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]']",0,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0
Characterization and phosphorylation of CREB-like proteins in Aplysia central nervous system.,"Studies in Aplysia californica indicate that cAMP-mediated gene expression is necessary for long-term facilitation, a correlate of long-term memory. It has been shown that blocking the expression of cAMP-inducible genes in sensory neurons impedes long-term facilitation without any effect on short-term facilitation. Specifically, blocking the binding of CREB-like proteins or inhibiting the expression of a cAMP-inducible gene, C[symbon: see text]EBP, impairs long-term facilitation. In this report, we show the presence of a family of CREB-like proteins in Aplysia CNS that specifically bind to the CRE sequence and cross-react with rat CREB antibodies. Similar to mammalian CREB proteins, Aplysia homologues interact with each other via leucine zipper domains. This interaction can be disrupted by peptides containing the CREB leucine zipper sequence. We demonstrate that a 43 kDa CREB-like protein present in CNS extracts can be phosphorylated in vitro by cAMP-dependent protein kinase A. Moreover, exposure of ganglia to serotonin (5-HT), a transmitter involved in long-term facilitation, increases the phosphorylation of this protein. This biochemical data further supports the involvement of CREB-like proteins in memory storage.","['Animals', 'Aplysia', 'Blotting, Western', 'Central Nervous System', 'Cyclic AMP', 'Long-Term Potentiation', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proteins', 'Rats']",8804712,"[['B01.050'], ['B01.050.500.644.400.060'], ['E05.196.401.143', 'E05.301.300.096', 'E05.478.566.320.200', 'E05.601.262', 'E05.601.470.320.200'], ['A08.186'], ['D03.633.100.759.646.138.395', 'D13.695.462.200', 'D13.695.667.138.395', 'D13.695.827.068.395'], ['G11.561.638.350'], ['G02.111.665', 'G02.607.780', 'G03.796'], ['D12.776'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

"Expression levels and co‑targets of miRNA‑126‑3p and miRNA‑126‑5p in lung adenocarcinoma tissues: Án exploration with RT‑qPCR, microarray and bioinformatic analyses.","Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is the most common histological subtype of lung cancer. Previous studies have found that many microRNAs (miRNAs), including miRNA‑126‑3p, may play a critical role in the development of LUAD. However, no study of LUAD has researched the synergistic effects and co‑targets of both miRNA‑126‑3p and miRNA‑126‑5p. The present study used real‑time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT‑qPCR) to explore the expression values of miRNA‑126‑3p and miRNA‑126‑5p in 101 LUAD and 101 normal lung tissues. Ten relevant microarray datasets were screened to further validate the expression levels of miRNA‑126‑3p and ‑5p in LUAD. Twelve prediction tools were employed to obtain potential targets of miRNA‑126‑3p and miRNA‑126‑5p. The results showed that both miRNA‑126‑3p and ‑5p were expressed significantly lower in LUAD. A significant positive correlation was also present between miRNA‑126‑3p and ‑5p expression in LUAD. In addition, lower expression of miRNA‑126‑3p and ‑5p was indicative of vascular invasion, lymph node metastasis (LNM), and a later tumor/node/metastasis (TNM) stage of LUAD. The authors obtained 167 targets of miRNA‑126‑3p and 212 targets of miRNA‑126‑5p; 44 targets were co‑targets of both. Eight co‑target genes (IGF2BP1, TRPM8, DUSP4, SOX11, PLOD2, LIN28A, LIN28B and SLC7A11) were initially identified as key genes in LUAD. The results of the present study indicated that the co‑regulation of miRNA‑126‑3p and miRNA‑126‑5p plays a key role in the development of LUAD, which also suggests a fail‑proof mode between miRNA‑3p and miRNA‑126‑5p.","['Adenocarcinoma of Lung', 'Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Computational Biology', 'Datasets as Topic', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Lung', 'Lung Neoplasms', 'MicroRNAs', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Software', 'Tissue Array Analysis']",30535503,"[['C04.557.470.200.025.022', 'C04.588.894.797.520.055'], ['D23.101.140'], ['G04.161.750', 'G07.345.249.410.750'], ['H01.158.273.180', 'L01.313.124'], ['E05.318.308.056', 'L01.313.500.750.300.188.400.500', 'L01.399.250.224', 'L01.470.750.750.431', 'N05.715.360.300.224', 'N06.850.520.308.056'], ['G05.308.370'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['A04.411'], ['C04.588.894.797.520', 'C08.381.540', 'C08.785.520'], ['D13.150.650.319', 'D13.444.735.150.319', 'D13.444.735.790.552.500'], ['E05.393.620.500.706'], ['L01.224.900'], ['E05.588.570.850']]","['Diseases [C]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0
New paths of cyanogenesis from enzymatic-promoted cleavage of â-cyanoglucosides are suggested by a mixed DFT/QTAIM approach.,"Cyanogenesis is an enzyme-promoted cleavage of â-cyanoglucosides; the release of hydrogen cyanide is believed to produce food poisoning by consumption of certain crops as Cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz). The production of hydrogen cyanide by some disruption of the plant wall is related to the content of two â-cyanoglucosides (linamarin and lotaustralin) which are stored within the tuber. Some features about the mechanistic bases of these transformations have been published; nevertheless, there are still questions about the exact mechanism, such as the feasibility of a difference in the kinetics of cyanogenesis between both cyanoglucosides. In this work, we have performed a theoretical analysis using DFT and QTAIM theoretical frameworks to propose a feasible mechanism of the observed first step of the enzyme-catalyzed rupture of these glucosides; our results led us to explain the observed difference between linamarin and lotaustralin. Meanwhile, DFT studies suggest that there are no differences between local reactivity indexes of both glucosides; QTAIM topological analysis suggests two important intramolecular interactions which we found to fix the glucoside in such a way that suggests the linamarin as a more reactive system towards a nucleophilic attack, thus explaining the readiness to liberate hydrogen cyanide.","['Biocatalysis', 'Biotransformation', 'Glucosides', 'Hydrogen Cyanide', 'Kinetics', 'Manihot', 'Molecular Structure', 'Nitriles', 'Plant Tubers', 'Quantum Theory', 'Thermodynamics']",31478108,"[['G02.111.086', 'G02.130.500', 'G03.105'], ['G03.171', 'G03.787.225', 'G07.690.725.225'], ['D09.408.348'], ['D01.029.260.330', 'D01.625.400'], ['G01.374.661', 'G02.111.490'], ['B01.650.940.800.575.912.250.859.797.438.535'], ['G02.111.570', 'G02.466'], ['D02.626'], ['A18.400.625'], ['H01.671.579.800'], ['G01.906']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]']",1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
What's Ub chain linkage got to do with it?,"Ubiquitination-the covalent conjugation of ubiquitin (Ub) to other cellular proteins-regulates a wide range of cellular processes. Often, multiple Ub molecules are added to the substrate to form a Ub chain. Distinct outcomes have been observed for substrates modified with multi-Ub chains linked through particular lysine residues. However, recent studies suggest that Ub chain linkages may not be the key determinant for substrate fate. Here, we review evidence suggesting that Ub-binding proteins play a pivotal role in determining the outcome of substrate ubiquitination. In fulfilling their functions in proteasome-mediated proteolysis or signaling, Ub receptors link ubiquitinated proteins to downstream molecules through protein-protein interactions. Studies of Ub-binding factors may therefore hold the key to understanding the diverse functions of the Ub molecule.","['Carrier Proteins', 'Models, Biological', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Signal Transduction', 'Ubiquitin']",16608998,"[['D12.776.157'], ['E05.599.395'], ['D05.500.562.500', 'D08.811.277.656.918', 'D08.811.600.730'], ['G02.111.660.871.790.600', 'G02.111.691.600', 'G03.734.871.790.600', 'G05.308.670.600'], ['G02.111.820', 'G04.835'], ['D12.776.947.500']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Screening of malignant hyperthermia susceptible families by creatine phosphokinase measurement and other clinical investigations.,"We investigated 56 families afflicted with malignant hyperpyrexia. One hundred and twenty-four individuals within these families had had an episode of malignant hyperthermia, of whom we saw seventy-two. Serum creatine phosphokinase (CPK) was statistically higher in affected individuals and in close relatives than in normal volunteers. The magnitude of the serum CPK elevations varied significantly between families. While in some families the serum CPK was clearly elevated in affected individuals, in other families the serum CPK was normal or only moderately or inconsistently raised. In these latter families serum CPK measurement was therfore of little or no value in identifying afflicted members. The incidence of musculoskeletal abnormalities was greater in affected individuals and in close relatives than in the general population. Thus, the concomitant individual belonging to a family known to be susceptible to malignant hyperthermia was a better indicator of the MH trait than was the presence of only one of these parameters. For reasons which we do not fully understand, MHS individuals were found to require fewer anaesthetics than normal persons. The incidence of MH crises within each family fell significantly following investigation, counselling, and issuance of Medic-Alert bracelets.","['Creatine Kinase', 'Humans', 'Malignant Hyperthermia', 'Pedigree']",938964,"[['D08.811.913.696.640.150'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C23.550.505.700', 'C23.550.767.600'], ['E05.393.673']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Factors contributing to the incompatibility between simplified-step adhesives and chemically-cured or dual-cured composites. Part III. Effect of acidic resin monomers.,"PURPOSE: This study examined the polymerization kinetics of acid-contaminated light- and chemically-cured resins with the use of differential scanning calorimetry.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Light-cured and chemically-cured versions of an experimental bis-GMA/TEG-DMA resin at the ratio (w:w) of 62:38 were prepared. Four acidic resin monomers with either carboxylic (DSDM and MAA) or phosphoric functional groups (MP and 2MP) were added at a 10 wt% concentration to these resins to simulate the intermixing of resin composites and unpolymerized acidic monomers along the adhesive-composite interface of simplified-step dentin adhesives. Different concentrations of the most acidic monomer 2MP (10 to 50 wt% for the light-cured resin, and 2 to 4 wt% for the chemically-cured resin) were also added to examine their contribution to reducing the extent and rate of polymerization of these resin mixtures. The effect of sodium benzene sulphinate on the polymerization of the chemically-cured resin that was contaminated with 10 wt% 2MP was also investigated.RESULTS: At 10 wt% concentration, all acidic monomers had a limited effect on the polymerization of the light-cured resin. The rate and extent of polymerization in the chemically-cured resin was substantially reduced by the carboxylic acid monomers DSDM and MAA, while polymerization was completely inhibited in the presence of the organophosphate monomers MP and 2MP. Substantial reductions in the rate and extent of polymerization of the light-cured resin occurred only in the presence of high concentrations (30 to 50 wt%) of 2MP. More acute polymerization inhibition was observed when the chemically-cured resin was contaminated with 2 to 3 wt% 2MP, with polymerization completely inhibited at 4 wt%. Addition of sodium benzene sulphinate to 2MP-contaminated chemically-cured resin revived the previously uncured resins, but their rate and extent of polymerization were still inferior to that of uncontaminated chemically-cured resin.CONCLUSION: When the influence of adhesive permeability was excluded with the use of neat, water-free resins, deactivation of the tertiary amine utilized in the chemically-cured resin by even very low concentrations of acidic resin monomers accounts for the reported incompatibility between simplified-step dentin adhesives and chemically-cured composites. The polymerization of light-cured resin is only affected by much higher concentrations of acidic resin monomers.","['Acids', 'Benzenesulfonates', 'Bisphenol A-Glycidyl Methacrylate', 'Calorimetry, Differential Scanning', 'Carboxylic Acids', 'Composite Resins', 'Dentin-Bonding Agents', 'Ethylene Glycol', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Light', 'Methacrylates', 'Permeability', 'Polyethylene Glycols', 'Polymers', 'Polymethacrylic Acids', 'Time Factors']",15008334,"[['D01.029'], ['D02.455.426.559.389.097', 'D02.886.645.600.080.050.100'], ['D02.241.081.069.600.150', 'D02.455.426.559.389.657.100', 'D05.750.716.822.308.200', 'D25.339.816.500.200', 'D25.720.716.822.308.200', 'J01.637.051.339.816.500.200', 'J01.637.051.720.716.822.308.200'], ['E05.196.131.310', 'E05.196.370.310'], ['D02.241'], ['D05.750.716.822.308', 'D25.339.816.500', 'D25.720.716.822.308', 'J01.637.051.339.816.500', 'J01.637.051.720.716.822.308'], ['D25.339.291.300', 'J01.637.051.339.291.300'], ['D02.033.455.250.268'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['G02.300'], ['G01.358.500.505.650', 'G01.590.540', 'G01.750.250.650', 'G01.750.770.578'], ['D02.241.081.069.600'], ['G02.723'], ['D02.033.455.250.700', 'D05.750.741', 'D25.720.741', 'J01.637.051.720.741'], ['D05.750', 'D25.720', 'J01.637.051.720'], ['D02.241.081.069.800', 'D05.750.716.822.111.650', 'D25.720.716.822.111.650', 'J01.637.051.720.716.822.111.650'], ['G01.910.857']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
Complement activation by the alternative pathway is modified in renal failure: the role of factor D.,"Factor D, an essential enzyme of the alternative pathway (AP) of complement, is eliminated by the kidney, and its plasma concentration increases 10-fold in end-stage renal disease (ESRD). The purpose of this study was to analyze the consequences of factor D accumulation. A number of in vitro assays were used to analyze AP activation in normal human serum (NHS), in normal serum supplemented with purified factor D to 10-fold its normal concentration (10 x D), and in sera of patients with ESRD. When compared with NHS, in 10 x D: 1) Spontaneous fluid-phase activation of complement at 37 degrees C was greatly increased as measured by C3 cleavage, 2) The lysis of rabbit erythrocytes, a function of the AP, was accelerated, 3) More C3 fragments bound to cuprophane membranes and to immune precipitates; both reactions were accompanied by the formation of more C5a, 4) Complement mediated solubilization of antigen-antibody precipitates was enhanced. Sera of patients with ESRD behaved similarly to 10 x D in all assays used, i.e., enhanced AP function, although complement activation measured in these assays varied widely from one individual to another. Thus, the elevated factor D concentration observed in renal failure might have important pathophysiological consequences, some of which could be detrimental (e.g., C5a produced during hemodialysis), while others might be beneficial, e.g., solubilization of immune precipitates.","['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Complement Activating Enzymes', 'Complement C3', 'Complement C3b', 'Complement C5a', 'Complement Factor D', 'Complement Pathway, Alternative', 'Humans', 'Kidney Failure, Chronic', 'Middle Aged']",2805459,"[['M01.060.116.100'], ['M01.060.116.100.080'], ['D08.811.277.300', 'D12.776.124.486.274.045'], ['D12.776.124.050.140', 'D12.776.124.486.274.250'], ['D12.776.124.486.274.250.260'], ['D12.776.124.486.274.024.270', 'D12.776.124.486.274.450.250'], ['D08.811.277.300.450', 'D08.811.277.656.300.760.200', 'D08.811.277.656.959.350.200', 'D12.776.124.486.274.045.450'], ['G12.274.695'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C12.777.419.780.750.500', 'C13.351.968.419.780.750.500'], ['M01.060.116.630']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]']",0,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

Lactic acid production directly from starch in a starch-controlled fed-batch operation using Lactobacillus amylophilus.,"Based on the batch results, we constructed a simplified simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF) model for the simulation of lactic acid production directly from unhydrolyzed potato starch using Lactobacillus amylophilus. The results of batch operation at different initial starch concentrations (20, 40 and 60 g/l) indicated that a higher initial starch concentration would lead to a slightly lower productivity, but would largely decrease the yield. Among that, the batch with 20 g/l of initial starch had the maximum productivity and the maximum yield, which would be 0.31 g/(l h) and 98% (g/g), respectively. In view of increasing the productivity and the final lactic acid concentration, a starch-controlled fed-batch operation with 20 g/l of initial starch was performed. It showed the fed-batch operation with starch controlled at 8 ± 1 g/l by adjusting the starch-feeding rate led to the maximum productivity of 0.75 g/(l h) and the yield of 69%.","['Biochemistry', 'Biomass', 'Bioreactors', 'Fermentation', 'Glucose', 'Hydrolysis', 'Industrial Microbiology', 'Kinetics', 'Lactic Acid', 'Lactobacillus', 'Models, Statistical', 'Solanum tuberosum', 'Starch', 'Temperature', 'Time Factors']",20373112,"[['H01.158.201', 'H01.181.122'], ['G16.500.275.157.100', 'N06.230.124.100'], ['E07.115', 'J01.897.120.115'], ['G02.111.158.249', 'G03.191.249'], ['D09.947.875.359.448'], ['G02.380'], ['H01.158.273.540.460', 'J01.897.120.460'], ['G01.374.661', 'G02.111.490'], ['D02.241.511.459.450'], ['B03.353.750.450.475', 'B03.510.460.400.410.475.475', 'B03.510.550.450.475'], ['E05.318.740.500', 'E05.599.835', 'N05.715.360.750.530', 'N06.850.520.830.500'], ['B01.650.940.800.575.912.250.908.500.725.777'], ['D05.750.078.562.855', 'D09.301.915', 'D09.698.365.855'], ['G01.906.595', 'G16.500.275.063.725.710', 'G16.500.750.775.710', 'N06.230.150.450', 'N06.230.300.100.725.710'], ['G01.910.857']]","['Disciplines and Occupations [H]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]']",0,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0
"Peak power, ground reaction forces, and velocity during the squat exercise performed at different loads.","This study examined the changes in peak power, ground reaction force and velocity with different loads during the performance of the parallel squat movement. Twelve experienced male lifters (26.83 +/- 4.67 years of age) performed the standard parallel squat, using loads equal to 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, and 90% of 1 repetition maximum (1RM). Each subject performed all parallel squats with as much explosiveness as possible using his own technique. Peak power (PP), peak ground reaction force (PGRF), peak barbell velocity (PV), force at the time of PP (FPP), and velocity at the time of PP (VPP) were determined from force, velocity, and power curves calculated using barbell velocity and ground reaction force data. No significant differences were detected among loads for PP; however, the greatest PP values were associated with loads of 40 and 50% of 1RM. Higher loads produced greater PGRF and FPP values than lower loads (p < 0.05) in all cases except between loads equal to 60-50, 50-40, and 40-30% of 1RM for PGRF, and between loads equal to 70-60 and 60-50% of 1RM for FPP. Higher loads produced lower PV and VPP values than lower loads (p < 0.05) in all cases except between the 20-30, 70-80, and 80-90% of 1RM conditions.

Long-term effects of cyclosporine A in Alport's syndrome.,"BACKGROUND: In 1991, our initial results of cyclosporine A (CsA) administration in eight patients with Alport's syndrome were published. A significant decrease in or disappearance of proteinuria and apparently good tolerance to CsA were observed in all patients.METHODS: CsA administration has been maintained in these eight patients with the aim of obtaining further information about the clinical course of the disease. The ages of these eight patients currently range from 15 to 27 years, and the mean duration of treatment is from 7 to 10 years (x = 8.4 years).RESULTS: Renal function has remained stable, with no evaluable changes in serum creatinine levels compared with pre-CsA treatment values. Proteinuria in all patients has either remained negative or are values far lower than pretreatment levels. A second renal biopsy was performed in all patients after five years of CsA administration. No aggravation of the lesion present at the first biopsy or lesions typical of cyclosporine intoxication was observed.CONCLUSIONS: After a mean duration of 8.4 years and with no deterioration in renal function, we found possible beneficial effects of the continued treatment of CsA in patients with Alport's syndrome who present evidence of progression to renal insufficiency.","['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Creatinine', 'Cyclosporine', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Failure, Chronic', 'Male', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Nephritis, Hereditary', 'Proteinuria', 'Time Factors']",10027943,"[['M01.060.057'], ['M01.060.116'], ['D03.383.129.308.207'], ['D04.345.566.235.300', 'D12.644.641.235.300'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['A05.810.453'], ['C12.777.419.780.750.500', 'C13.351.968.419.780.750.500'], ['E01.370.350.515.402', 'E05.595.402'], ['C12.706.742', 'C12.777.419.570.620', 'C13.351.875.742', 'C13.351.968.419.570.620', 'C16.131.939.742', 'C17.300.200.517'], ['C12.777.934.734', 'C13.351.968.934.734', 'C23.888.942.750'], ['G01.910.857']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
Impact of human immunodeficiency virus infection on the prevalence and severity of steatosis in patients with chronic hepatitis C virus infection.,"BACKGROUND/AIMS: Although steatosis is strongly associated with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, little is known about this finding in patients coinfected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and HCV. The aims of the present study were to determine the prevalence and severity of steatosis in HIV/HCV coinfected patients.METHODS: Consecutive patients undergoing liver biopsy were prospectively identified and were interviewed to obtain detailed demographic and clinical data. Steatosis was scored according to the percentage of hepatocytes involved: 0 (none), 1 (<33%), 2 (33-66%), or 3 (>66%); fibrosis was scored on a scale from 0 to 4.RESULTS: A total of 708 patients were enrolled, including 154 with HIV/HCV coinfection and 554 with HCV monoinfection. Steatosis of any grade (72.1 vs. 52.0%, P<0.001), grade 2/3 steatosis (48.1 vs. 20.2%, P<0.001), and stage 3/4 fibrosis (43.5 vs. 30.0%, P=0.002) were significantly more common in coinfected patients. Compared to HCV monoinfected subjects, HIV/HCV coinfection was associated with a significantly increased odds of steatosis of any grade (OR=3.21; 95% CI, 1.84-5.60) and grade 2/3 steatosis (OR=5.63; 95% CI, 3.05-10.36) after adjusting for potential confounding variables. Among coinfected patients, the fibrosis progression rate increased in a linear fashion with the grade of steatosis.CONCLUSIONS: Steatosis is more common and more severe in HIV/HCV coinfected patients than in those with HCV monoinfection.","['Fatty Liver', 'Female', 'HIV Infections', 'Hepatitis C, Chronic', 'Humans', 'Liver Cirrhosis', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prevalence', 'United States']",16618518,"[['C06.552.241'], ['C01.221.250.875', 'C01.221.812.640.400', 'C01.778.640.400', 'C01.925.782.815.616.400', 'C01.925.813.400', 'C20.673.480'], ['C01.221.250.750.120', 'C01.925.440.440.120', 'C01.925.782.350.350.120', 'C06.552.380.350.120', 'C06.552.380.705.440.120'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C06.552.630', 'C23.550.355.412'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['E05.318.308.985.525.750', 'N01.224.935.597.750', 'N06.850.505.400.975.525.750', 'N06.850.520.308.985.525.750'], ['Z01.107.567.875']]","['Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Geographicals [Z]']",0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1
Autocrine expression and ontogenetic functions of the PACAP ligand/receptor system during sympathetic development.,"The superior cervical ganglion (SCG) is a well-characterized model of neural development, in which several regulatory signals have been identified. Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) has been found to regulate diverse ontogenetic processes in sympathetics, though functional requirements for high peptide concentrations suggest that other ligands are involved. We now describe expression and functions of pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) during SCG ontogeny, suggesting that the peptide plays critical roles in neurogenesis. PACAP and PACAP receptor (PAC(1)) mRNA's were detected at embryonic days 14.5 (E14.5) through E17.5 in vivo and virtually all precursors exhibited ligand and receptor, indicating that the system is expressed as neuroblasts proliferate. Exposure of cultured precursors to PACAP peptides, containing 27 or 38 residues, increased mitogenic activity 4-fold. Significantly, PACAP was 1000-fold more potent than VIP and a highly potent and selective antagonist entirely blocked effects of micromolar VIP, consistent with both peptides acting via PAC(1) receptors. Moreover, PACAP potently enhanced precursor survival more than 2-fold, suggesting that previously defined VIP effects were mediated via PAC(1) receptors and that PACAP is the more significant developmental signal. In addition to neurogenesis, PACAP promoted neuronal differentiation, increasing neurite outgrowth 4-fold and enhancing expression of neurotrophin receptors trkC and trkA. Since PACAP potently activated cAMP and PI pathways and increased intracellular Ca(2+), the peptide may interact with other developmental signals. PACAP stimulation of precursor mitosis, survival, and trk receptor expression suggests that the signaling system plays a critical autocrine role during sympathetic neurogenesis.","['Animals', 'Cell Survival', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cyclic AMP', 'DNA', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Ligands', 'Mitosis', 'Neurites', 'Neuropeptides', 'Pituitary Adenylate Cyclase-Activating Polypeptide', 'RNA, Messenger', 'Rats', 'Receptor, trkA', 'Receptors, Pituitary Adenylate Cyclase-Activating Polypeptide', 'Receptors, Pituitary Hormone', 'Second Messenger Systems', 'Superior Cervical Ganglion', 'Sympathetic Nervous System', 'Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide']",10694416,"[['B01.050'], ['G04.346'], ['A11.251'], ['D03.633.100.759.646.138.395', 'D13.695.462.200', 'D13.695.667.138.395', 'D13.695.827.068.395'], ['D13.444.308'], ['G05.308.310'], ['D27.720.470.480'], ['G04.144.220.220.781', 'G05.113.220.781'], ['A08.675.256.500', 'A08.675.542.145.500', 'A11.284.180.610', 'A11.671.501.145.500', 'A11.671.543'], ['D12.644.400', 'D12.776.631.650'], ['D12.644.276.860.887', 'D12.644.400.625', 'D12.776.467.860.887', 'D12.776.631.600.887', 'D12.776.631.650.625', 'D23.529.850.887'], ['D13.444.735.544'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700'], ['D08.811.913.696.620.682.725.400.660', 'D12.776.543.750.630.496', 'D12.776.543.750.750.400.550.550'], ['D12.776.543.750.695.665'], ['D12.776.543.750.750.660'], ['G02.111.820.800', 'G04.835.800'], ['A08.340.315.350.850', 'A08.800.050.300.300.850', 'A08.800.050.800.300.850'], ['A08.800.050.800'], ['D06.472.317.950', 'D06.472.699.952', 'D12.644.400.875', 'D12.644.548.952', 'D12.776.631.650.875']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]']",1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Activity patterns in human motion-sensitive areas depend on the interpretation of global motion.,"Numerous imaging studies have contributed to the localization of motion-sensitive areas in the human brain. It is, however, still unclear how these areas contribute to global motion perception. Here, we investigate with functional MRI whether the motion-sensitive area hMT+/V5 is involved in perceptual segmentation and integration of motion signals. Stimuli were overlapping moving gratings that can be perceived either as two independently moving, transparent surfaces or as a single surface moving in an intermediate direction. We examined whether motion-sensitive area hMT+/V5 is involved in mediating the switches between the two percepts. The data show differential activation of hMT+/V5 with perceptual switches, suggesting that these are associated with a reconfiguration of cell assemblies in this area.","['Brain', 'Humans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Motion Perception', 'Pattern Recognition, Visual', 'Photic Stimulation', 'Time Factors']",12368476,"[['A08.186.211'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E01.370.350.825.500'], ['F02.463.593.932.567'], ['F02.463.593.524.500', 'F02.463.593.932.622'], ['E05.723.729'], ['G01.910.857']]","['Anatomy [A]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
The effect of sevoflurane on the release of [3H]dopamine from rat brain cortical slices.,"Dopamine is a neurotransmitter that exerts major control on important brain functions and some lines of studies suggest that dopaminergic neurotransmission may be a potential target for volatile anesthetics. In the present study, rat brain cortical slices were labeled with [(3)H]dopamine to investigate the effects of sevoflurane on the release of this neurotransmitter. [(3)H]dopamine release was significantly increased in the presence of sevoflurane (0.46 mM) and this effect was independent of extracellular or intracellular calcium. In addition, [(3)H]dopamine release evoked by sevoflurane was not affected by TTX (blocker of voltage-dependent sodium channels) or reserpine (a blocker of the vesicular monoamine transporter). These data suggest that the dopamine release induced by sevoflurane is non-vesicular, independent of exocytosis and, would be mediated by the dopamine transporter (DAT). GBR12909 and nomifensine, inhibitors of DAT, decreased the release of [(3)H]dopamine evoked by sevoflurane. The same effect was also observed when the brain cortical slices were incubated at low temperature and low extracellular sodium. Ouabain, a Na(+)/K(+) ATPase pump inhibitor, which is known to induce dopamine release through reverse transport, decreased [(3)H]dopamine release induced by sevoflurane. In conclusion, the present study suggests that sevoflurane increases [(3)H]dopamine release in brain cortical slices that is mediated by DAT located at the plasma membrane.","['Adrenergic Uptake Inhibitors', 'Animals', 'Cerebral Cortex', 'Chelating Agents', 'Dopamine', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Interactions', 'Enzyme Inhibitors', 'Female', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Male', 'Methyl Ethers', 'Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar', 'Reserpine', 'Sevoflurane', 'Sodium', 'Tritium']",17452291,"[['D27.505.519.562.437.050', 'D27.505.519.625.050.601', 'D27.505.519.625.600.050', 'D27.505.696.577.050.601', 'D27.505.696.577.600.050'], ['B01.050'], ['A08.186.211.200.885.287.500'], ['D27.505.519.914.500', 'D27.720.832.500'], ['D02.092.211.215.406', 'D02.092.311.342', 'D02.455.426.559.389.657.166.175.342'], ['G07.690.773.875', 'G07.690.936.500'], ['G07.690.773.968'], ['D27.505.519.389'], ['E05.481'], ['D02.355.601'], ['D27.505.954.502.780'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700.900'], ['D03.132.436.681.933.500', 'D03.633.100.473.402.681.933.500', 'D03.633.100.496.500.500.681.933.500'], ['D02.355.601.810', 'D02.455.526.510.717'], ['D01.268.549.750', 'D01.268.557.650', 'D01.552.528.850', 'D01.552.547.725'], ['D01.268.406.875', 'D01.362.340.875', 'D01.496.749.925']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Characterization of nosocomial Serratia marcescens isolates: comparison of Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy with pulsed-field gel electrophoresis of genomic DNA fragments and multilocus enzyme electrophoresis.,"A total of 66 Serratia marcescens isolates from 46 patients was investigated by macrorestriction using XbaI followed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. 7 restriction fragment patterns attributable to more than one patient and 9 individual patterns were identified. The isolates were additionally characterized by multilocus enzyme electrophoresis and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy. The macrorestriction patterns and the multilocus enzyme electrophoresis patterns corresponded fairly well while the classifications derived from these methods were not completely congruent. The grouping achieved by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy on the basis of high (> 1000) and moderately high heterogeneity values (300) was consistent with the macrorestriction results. Grouping on a lower heterogeneity level did not contribute to further discrimination. In general, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy was less discriminatory than the two other methods, but easier to perform. Therefore, laboratories equipped with the necessary devices may use it to rapidly select bacterial isolates for macrorestriction or other well established characterization procedures.","['Cross Infection', 'Electrophoresis', 'Electrophoresis, Gel, Pulsed-Field', 'Serratia marcescens', 'Spectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared']",10467658,"[['C01.248', 'C23.550.291.875.500'], ['E05.196.401', 'E05.301.300'], ['E05.196.401.220', 'E05.301.300.220'], ['B03.440.450.425.814.664', 'B03.660.250.150.720.500'], ['E05.196.712.726.676.700', 'E05.196.867.826.676.700']]","['Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]']",0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Tafluprost protects rat retinal ganglion cells from apoptosis in vitro and in vivo.,"BACKGROUND: To investigate whether tafluprost, which is a prostaglandin-related compound and an anti-glaucoma drug, has a direct anti-apoptotic effect in cultured retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and rat RGCs in retinas with optic nerve crush (ONC).METHODS: RGC-5 cells were induced to undergo apoptosis by a serum deprivation and by exogenous glutamate. The level of cell death with or without tafluprost was monitored by an XTT assay and by immunocytochemistry with activated caspase-3. Changes in intracellular calcium ([Ca(2+)]i) levels were measured with fluo-4 fluorescence. Rat RGCs were degenerated by ONC. After topical instillation of tafluprost for 7 and 14 days, the numbers of retrograde-labeled RGCs were counted. Retinal flatmounts were subjected to terminal dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining to detect apoptotic cells.RESULTS: Tafluprost dose-dependently promoted RGC-5 cell viability with an optimum concentration of 3 microM (p = 0.006). Tafluprost significantly reduced caspase-3-positive cells and suppressed [Ca(+2)]i evoked by exogenous glutamate. The cGMP-dependent protein kinase inhibitor and KT-5823 partially blocked the rescue effect of tafluprost (p = 0.002). The survival rate of RGCs significantly increased in eyes treated with tafluprost (p = 0.01), and the prevalence of TUNEL-positive cells was significantly decreased 14 days after ONC (p < 0.001).CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that tafluprost has an anti-apoptotic effect in RGCs.","['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Calcium', 'Calcium Channel Blockers', 'Carbazoles', 'Caspase 3', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival', 'Culture Media, Serum-Free', 'Cyclic GMP-Dependent Protein Kinases', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Glutamic Acid', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Instillation, Drug', 'Intracellular Membranes', 'Intraocular Pressure', 'Male', 'Nerve Crush', 'Neuroprotective Agents', 'Ophthalmic Solutions', 'Optic Nerve', 'Prostaglandins F', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Retinal Ganglion Cells', 'Time Factors']",19551401,"[['B01.050'], ['G04.146.954.035'], ['D01.268.552.100', 'D01.552.539.288', 'D23.119.100'], ['D27.505.519.562.249', 'D27.505.696.260.500', 'D27.505.954.411.192'], ['D03.633.100.473.144', 'D03.633.300.148'], ['D08.811.277.656.262.500.126.350.300', 'D08.811.277.656.300.200.126.350.300', 'D12.644.360.075.405.350.300', 'D12.776.476.075.405.350.300'], ['A11.251.210'], ['G04.346'], ['D27.720.470.305.255', 'E07.206.255'], ['D08.811.913.696.620.682.700.150.150', 'D12.644.360.200.150', 'D12.776.476.200.150'], ['G07.690.773.875', 'G07.690.936.500'], ['D12.125.067.625.349', 'D12.125.119.409.349', 'D12.125.427.300'], ['E05.481'], ['E02.319.267.641'], ['A11.284.149.450', 'A11.284.835.514'], ['G14.440'], ['E04.525.210.560'], ['D27.505.696.706.548', 'D27.505.954.427.575'], ['D26.776.708.645', 'D27.505.954.578.645', 'D27.720.752.608'], ['A08.800.800.120.680'], ['D10.251.355.255.550.400', 'D23.469.050.175.725.400'], ['D27.505.519.389.755'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700.750'], ['A08.675.650.850.875', 'A09.371.729.831.875', 'A11.671.650.850.875'], ['G01.910.857']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Enzymatic recovery and purification of polyhydroxybutyrate produced by Ralstonia eutropha.,"Polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) is the most studied among a wide variety of polyhydroxyalkanoates, bacterial biodegradable polymers known as potential substitutes for conventional plastics. This work aimed at evaluating the use of enzymes to recover and purify the PHB produced by Ralstonia eutropha DSM545. Screening experiments allowed the selection of trypsin, bromelain and lysozyme among six enzymes, based on their efficiency in lysing cells of a non-PHB producing R. eutropha strain. Then, process conditions for high efficiency in PHB purification from the DSM545 cells were searched for the enzymes previously selected. The best result was achieved with 2.0% of bromelain (enzyme mass per biomass), equivalent to 14.1 U ml(-1), at 50 degrees C and pH 9.0, resulting in 88.8% PHB purity. Aiming at improving the process efficiency and reducing the enzyme cost, experiments were carried out with pancreatin, leading to 90.0% polymer purity and an enzyme cost three times lower than the one obtained with bromelain. The molecular mass analysis of PHB showed no polymer degradation. Therefore, this work demonstrates the potential of using enzymes in order to recover and purify PHB and bacterial biopolymers in general.","['Cellulase', 'Culture Media', 'Cupriavidus necator', 'Cysteine Endopeptidases', 'Enzymes', 'Evaluation Studies as Topic', 'Hydroxybutyrates', 'Muramidase', 'Polyesters', 'Time Factors']",16253372,"[['D08.811.277.450.420.200.200'], ['D27.720.470.305', 'E07.206'], ['B03.440.400.425.251.200.200', 'B03.660.075.090.688.200.200'], ['D08.811.277.656.262.500', 'D08.811.277.656.300.200'], ['D08.811'], ['E05.337', 'N05.715.360.335'], ['D02.241.081.114.937', 'D02.241.511.429', 'D10.251.400.143.781'], ['D08.811.277.450.642'], ['D05.750.728', 'D25.720.728', 'J01.637.051.720.728'], ['G01.910.857']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0
Selective attention as tuning: the case of stroke weight.,"It has long been demonstrated that when grouping occurs, attention transfer between grouped elements is facilitated, as compared with attention transfer between elements-similarly distant-that are not grouped. This has been shown for grouping by connectedness, by orientation, and by color. The present article extends these findings to the case of similarity in coarseness. By using spatial cuing to elements drawn with different strokes, it is shown that the visual processing of elements that sharestroke heaviness with the cued element is more efficient than that of elements that do not. Three experiments, in which cue validity regarding the target's location and/or its stroke is manipulated, show that the facilitation has both an endogenous and an exogenous component. The findings are discussed in terms of visual tuning to the features of a stimulus, with tuning being the initial stage of visual processing required for identification and discrimination. It is proposed that grouping, rather than explaining the facilitation observed, can be explained by the notion of visual tuning to features. The findings also point to potential methodological pitfalls when different stroke weights are used, unintentionally, in visual displays.","['Attention', 'Cues', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Reaction Time', 'Space Perception', 'Touch', 'Transfer, Psychology', 'Visual Perception']",16773894,"[['F02.830.104.214'], ['F02.463.425.234'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E05.796.817', 'F02.830.650', 'F04.669.817', 'G11.561.677'], ['F02.463.593.778'], ['F02.830.816.850', 'G11.561.790.850'], ['F02.463.425.910'], ['F02.463.593.932']]","['Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Reactive glia support and guide axon growth in the rat thalamus during the first postnatal week. A sharply timed transition from permissive to non-permissive stage.,"The present study demonstrates a supportive and guiding effect of the reactive glia on the postlesional axon growth in vivo, and offers a model system to compare permissive and non-permissive forms of the glial reaction. After stab wounds in early postnatal (P2-P9) rats, the reactive glia and the nerve fibers were detected by the immunohistochemical staining of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and neurofilament protein, respectively. In the thalamus of the animals lesioned at P5 or earlier, an extraordinary bundle of fibers immunoreactive to neurofilament protein was found, corresponding to the lesion track marked by reactive glia. This bundle persisted up to 2 months, as shown by electron microscopy. When the animals were lesioned at P7 or later, the lesion track was immunonegative to neurofilament protein. Following P6 lesions, an intermediate situation was found, the strip of immunoreactive neurofilament protein was missing, or short and weak. GFAP immunostaining demonstrated a typical reactive glia in every case. As a result of the same operation, reactive glia plus a deficiency of neurofilament protein immunostaining was found in every animal in the cortex and the corpus callosum, independently from the age at lesion. The results demonstrate that the permissive nature of the glial reaction depends on the lesioned area as well, and changes to a non-permissive effect in a short time interval.","['Aging', 'Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'Brain Injuries', 'Cell Communication', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Denervation', 'Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein', 'Gliosis', 'Growth Cones', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Nerve Regeneration', 'Neurofilament Proteins', 'Neuroglia', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Rats', 'Thalamus']",11600320,"[['G07.345.124'], ['B01.050'], ['B01.050.050.282'], ['C10.228.140.199', 'C10.900.300.087', 'C26.915.300.200'], ['G04.085'], ['G04.152'], ['E04.525.210'], ['D05.750.078.593.400', 'D12.776.220.475.400'], ['C23.550.369'], ['A11.284.180.075.249', 'A11.284.180.225.340', 'A11.284.180.610.345', 'A11.671.137.340', 'A11.671.240.340'], ['E01.370.225.500.607.512', 'E01.370.225.750.551.512', 'E05.200.500.607.512', 'E05.200.750.551.512', 'E05.478.583', 'H01.158.100.656.234.512', 'H01.158.201.344.512', 'H01.158.201.486.512', 'H01.181.122.573.512', 'H01.181.122.605.512'], ['E01.370.350.515.402', 'E05.595.402'], ['G11.561.585', 'G16.762.611'], ['D05.750.078.593.630', 'D12.776.220.475.630', 'D12.776.631.630'], ['A08.637', 'A11.650'], ['G11.561.638'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700'], ['A08.186.211.200.317.826']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Identification and characterization of BpH2, a novel histone H1 homolog in Bordetella pertussis.","A basic protein, BpH2, with an apparent molecular mass of 18 kDa was purified from Bordetella pertussis, and the corresponding gene, bph2, was cloned. Sequence analysis revealed some homology to the H1 class of eukaryotic histones and to AlgP protein of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. BpH2 binds both single- and double-stranded DNA in a nonspecific manner. Deletion of the corresponding gene in B. pertussis generated a BpH2 null mutant with an altered growth rate in which the expression of two virulence factors, adenylate cyclase-hemolysin (CyaA) and filamentous hemagglutinin (FhaB), was reduced.

[Electrophysiologic effects of magnesium chloride on the Purkinje fibers of the dog].,"In order to relate the cardiac antiarrhytmic properties of magnesium chloride (MgCl2) to its electrophysiological effects, a comparison of its actions on three different models of automaticity of the isolated Purkinje fibers of the dog, has been carried out. The spontaneous activity of the Purkinje fibers perfused with Tyrode's solution containing 2.7 mM KC1 was gradually reduced as MgC12 concentration was increased from 3 to 9 mM/1. The automaticity induced adding barium chloride (BaC12) to the perfusion solution was suppressed increasing the concentration of MgC12 in the Tyrode's solution up to 5 mM/1. Previous increases in the concentration of MgCl2 prevents the electrophysiological effects BaC12. The negative chronotropic effects of MgC12, were less evident on the adrenalin induced automaticity of the Purkinje fibers. Simultaneous addition of adrenalin and MgC12 to the perfusion media increases membrane resting potential action potential amplitude and maximun rate of depolarisation of phase O in Purkinje fibers. It is concluded that MgC12 acts by distinct electrophysiological mechanisms against the different models of cardiac automaticity studied. This findings may provide interesting perspective in respect to the therapeutic properties of magnesium chloride.","['Animals', 'Anti-Arrhythmia Agents', 'Barium', 'Barium Compounds', 'Chlorides', 'Depression, Chemical', 'Dogs', 'Electrophysiology', 'Epinephrine', 'Female', 'Heart Conduction System', 'Heart Rate', 'Magnesium', 'Magnesium Chloride', 'Male', 'Membrane Potentials', 'Purkinje Fibers']",7159126,"[['B01.050'], ['D27.505.954.411.097'], ['D01.268.552.050', 'D01.268.556.062', 'D01.552.539.124', 'D01.552.544.062'], ['D01.103'], ['D01.210.450.150', 'D01.248.497.158.215'], ['G07.690.773.750'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.750.250.216.200'], ['H01.158.344.528', 'H01.158.782.236'], ['D02.033.100.291.310', 'D02.092.063.291.310', 'D02.092.211.215.454', 'D02.092.311.461', 'D02.455.426.559.389.657.166.175.461'], ['A07.541.409'], ['E01.370.600.875.500', 'G09.330.380.500'], ['D01.268.552.437', 'D01.268.557.500', 'D01.552.547.500'], ['D01.210.450.150.500', 'D01.524.475'], ['G01.154.535', 'G04.580', 'G07.265.675', 'G11.561.570'], ['A07.541.409.683']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
Cardiovascular monkey telemetry: sensitivity to detect QT interval prolongation.,"INTRODUCTION: Preclinical evaluation of delayed ventricular repolarization manifests electrocardiographically as QT interval prolongation and is routinely used as an indicator of potential risk for pro-arrhythmia (potential to cause Torsades de Pointes) of novel human pharmaceuticals. In accordance with ICH S7A and S7B guidelines we evaluated the sensitivity and validity of the monkey telemetry model as a preclinical predictor of QT interval prolongation in humans.METHODS: Cardiovascular monitoring was conducted for 2 h pre-dose and 24 h post-dosing with Moxifloxacin (MOX), with a toxicokinetic (TK) evaluation in a separate group of monkeys. In both studies, MOX was administered orally by gavage in 0.5% methylcellulose at 0, 10, 30, 100, 175 mg/kg. Each monkey received all 5 doses using a dose-escalation paradigm. Inherent variability of the model was assessed with administration of vehicle alone for 4 days in all 4 monkeys (0.5% methylcellulose in deionized water).RESULTS: MOX had no significant effect on mean arterial pressure, heart rate, PR or QRS intervals. MOX produced significant dose-related increases in QTc at doses of 30 (Cmax=5.5+/-0.6 microM), 100 (Cmax=16.5+/-1.6 microM), and 175 (Cmax=17.3+/-0.7 microM) mg/kg with peak increases of 22 (8%), 27 (10%), and 47 (18%) ms, respectively (p<or=0.05; compared to vehicle).DISCUSSION: In conclusion, we have developed a reproducible, sensitive and reliable primate telemetry model in rhesus monkeys, which exhibits low inherent intra-animal variability and high sensitivity to detect small but significant increases in QT/QTc interval (approximately 4%) with MOX in the same range of therapeutic plasma concentrations attained in humans. Therefore, the primate telemetry model should be considered an important preclinical predictor of QT prolongation of novel human pharmaceuticals.","['Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Anti-Infective Agents', 'Aza Compounds', 'Blood Pressure', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Electrocardiography', 'Electrodes, Implanted', 'Excipients', 'Fluoroquinolones', 'Heart Rate', 'Hemodynamics', 'Long QT Syndrome', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Male', 'Methylcellulose', 'Moxifloxacin', 'Quinolines', 'Telemetry']",16679034,"[['G17.035', 'L01.224.050'], ['B01.050'], ['D27.505.954.122'], ['D02.145'], ['E01.370.600.875.249', 'G09.330.380.076'], ['G07.690.773.875', 'G07.690.936.500'], ['E01.370.370.380.240', 'E01.370.405.240'], ['E07.305.250.319', 'E07.695.202'], ['D26.650.700.419', 'D27.720.744.770.419'], ['D03.633.100.810.835.322'], ['E01.370.600.875.500', 'G09.330.380.500'], ['G09.330.380'], ['C14.280.067.565', 'C14.280.123.625', 'C16.131.240.400.715', 'C23.550.073.547'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.199.120.510.550'], ['D09.698.365.180.663'], ['D03.633.100.810.835.322.327'], ['D03.633.100.810'], ['E01.370.520.750', 'E05.925', 'L01.178.847.675']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Diseases [C]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
Hydrophytes lack potential to exhibit cadmium stress induced enhancement in lipid peroxidation and accumulation of proline.,"Investigations were carried out to evaluate if hydrophytes (viz. Ceratophyllum, Wolffia, and Hydrilla) can be used as markers to assess the level of heavy metal pollution in aquatic bodies. The potential of these hydrophytes for lipid peroxidation and accumulation of proline in response to cadmium (Cd2+) pollution was studied. Hydrophytes were raised in artificial pond water (APW) supplemented with various levels of Cd2+. Interestingly, unlike mesophytes none of the hydrophytes showed ability to accumulate proline. Infact, in response to Cd2+ pollution hydrophytes exhibited a decline in proline levels in comparison to controls but mesophytes (viz. Brassica juncea, Vigna radiata and Triticum aestivum) showed progressive increase in the level of proline with increase in the extent of Cd2+ pollution. Mesophytes showed six to nine-fold increase in the level of proline in response to 1 mM Cd2+. The potential of the above hydrophytes for lipid peroxidation was also low under Cd2+ stress. In contrast, as expected a significant enhancement in the lipid peroxidation was observed in all three mesophytes in response to their exposure to Cd2+. About two-fold increase in production of malondialdehyde (a cytotoxic product of lipid peroxidation) was recorded in mesophytes exposed to 1 mM Cd2+. However, a decline in chlorophyll (Chl a and Chl b) levels was recorded in response to Cd2+pollution both in hydrophytes as well as mesophytes. In summary, hydrophytes neither have potential to accumulate proline nor have ability to accelerate lipid peroxidation under heavy metal stress. This suggests that the adaptive mechanism(s) existing in hydrophytes to tackle heavy metal stress is distinct from that in mesophytes.","['Cadmium', 'Fresh Water', 'India', 'Lipid Peroxidation', 'Magnoliopsida', 'Malondialdehyde', 'Proline', 'Water Pollution, Chemical']",15036869,"[['D01.268.556.137', 'D01.268.956.061', 'D01.552.544.137'], ['G16.500.275.280', 'N06.230.232'], ['Z01.252.245.393'], ['G02.111.515', 'G03.295.531.587'], ['B01.650.940.800.575.912.250'], ['D02.047.700'], ['D12.125.072.401.623'], ['N06.850.460.790.410']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Organisms [B]']",0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1
Cyclic AMP- and phorbol ester-regulated Cl- permeabilities in primary cultures of human and rabbit colonocytes.,"Chloride transport in 24-h primary cultures of human and rabbit distal colonic crypt cells (90 +/- 5% viable) were characterized using the Cl(-)-sensitive fluorescent probe 6-methoxyquinolyl acetoethyl ester. To calculate the Cl- influx in millimolar per second, the Stern-Volmer quenching constant was determined to be 24.3 M-1 for human and 24.6 M-1 for rabbit colonocytes. Cl- influx was dependent on extracellular Cl- concentration ([Cl-]0), with maximal influx at [Cl-]0 > or = 20 mM. The adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP)-dependent secretagogues forskolin (1 microM), prostaglandin E1 (1 microM), and 8-bromoadenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (100 microM) increased Cl- influx in human colonocytes from 0.35 +/- 0.08 to 2.14 +/- 0.65, 1.85 +/- 0.51, and 0.84 +/- 0.04 mM/s (n = 4), respectively, and in rabbit colonocytes from 0.22 +/- 0.03 to 1.04 +/- 0.11, 1.24 +/- 0.12, and 1.08 +/- 0.07 mM/s (n = 5), respectively. Depending on the secretagogue, this influx was inhibited 50-90% by the Cl- channel blocker diphenylamine-2-carboxylate (DPC; 50 microM) and > or = 65% by the Na-K-2Cl cotransport inhibitor furosemide (10 microM). Phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate, an activator of protein kinase C, increased Cl- permeability 3.8-fold in human and 2.4-fold in rabbit colonocytes. The phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate-stimulated Cl- permeabilities were sensitive to DPC and furosemide but not to indomethacin.

The evaluation of imprecision in collaborative immunoassay quality-assessment programmes.,"The calculation of within-laboratory imprecision in quality-assessment (QA) programmes normally involves combining data from different analyte concentrations to calculate an average standard deviation (SD) or coefficient of variation. However, for immunoassay neither of these parameters is concentration independent. This paper describes a method of calculating within-laboratory imprecision in QA programmes by assuming a linear relationship between SD and analyte concentration. This method is used in programmes conducted by the Australian Joint Working Party for Quality Control in Immunoassay to calculate imprecision at the limits of the reference range. Results from these programmes show that this method better represents the differences in imprecision between analytes, methods and laboratories than the calculation of a single imprecision parameter. The method is trivial for a computer and its robustness has been validated by Monte Carlo simulation. It is suggested that major differences in laboratory performance between different QA programmes may be due to inappropriate calculation of single imprecision parameters.","['Humans', 'Immunoassay', 'Laboratories', 'Quality Control', 'Reagent Kits, Diagnostic', 'Thyroxine', 'Triiodothyronine']",6517490,"[['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E05.478.566', 'E05.601.470'], ['J03.520', 'N02.278.487'], ['J01.897.608'], ['D27.505.259.875', 'D27.720.470.410.680', 'E07.720'], ['D06.472.931.812', 'D12.125.072.050.767'], ['D06.472.931.740.385', 'D12.125.072.050.767.741.894']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]']",0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0
Low-density granulocytes and monocytes as biomarkers of cardiovascular risk in systemic lupus erythematosus.,"OBJECTIVE: The aim was to evaluate the most relevant cell populations involved in vascular homeostasis as potential biomarkers of SLE-related cardiovascular disease (CVD).METHODS: Low-density granulocytes (LDGs), monocyte subsets, endothelial progenitor cells, angiogenic T (Tang) cells, CD4+CD28null and Th1/Th17 lymphocytes and serum cytokine levels were quantified in 109 SLE patients and 33 controls in relationship to the presence of subclinical carotid atheromatosis or cardiovascular disease. A second cohort including 31 recent-onset SLE patients was also included.RESULTS: Raised monocyte and LDG counts, particularly those LDGs negative for CD16/CD14 expression (nLDGs), in addition to the ratios of monocytes and nLDGs to high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDLc) molecules (MHR and nLHR, respectively), were present in SLE patients with traditional risk factors or subclinical atheromatosis but not in those who were CV-free, thus revealing their value in the identification of patients at risk of CVD, even at the onset of disease. Accordingly, nLDGs were correlated positively with carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT) and with inflammatory markers (CRP and IL-6). A bias towards more differentiated monocyte subsets, related to increased IFN-á and IL-17 serum levels, was also observed in patients. Intermediate monocytes were especially expanded, but independently of their involvement in CVD. Finally, CD4+CD28null, Th17 and Th1 lymphocytes were increased, with CD4+CD28null and Th17 cells being associated with cIMT, whereas endothelial progenitor and Tang cell levels were reduced in all SLE patients.CONCLUSION: The present study highlights the potential use of MHR and nLHR as valuable biomarkers of CVD risk in SLE patients, even at diagnosis. The increased amounts of nLDGs, monocytes, Th17 and senescent-CD28null subsets, coupled with reduced pro-angiogenic endothelial progenitor cells and Tang cells, could underlie the development of atheromatosis in SLE.","['Adult', 'Biomarkers', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cytokines', 'Female', 'Granulocytes', 'Humans', 'Lupus Erythematosus, Systemic', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Monocytes']",32031658,"[['M01.060.116'], ['D23.101'], ['C14'], ['E05.318.372.500.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.500'], ['D12.644.276.374', 'D12.776.467.374', 'D23.529.374'], ['A11.118.637.415', 'A11.148.350', 'A11.627.340', 'A15.145.229.637.415', 'A15.378.316.340', 'A15.382.490.315'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C17.300.480', 'C20.111.590'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['A11.118.637.555.652', 'A11.148.580', 'A11.627.624', 'A11.733.547', 'A15.145.229.637.555.652', 'A15.378.316.580', 'A15.382.490.555.652', 'A15.382.670.547', 'A15.382.680.547']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Organisms [B]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
"Application of Genetically Encoded Fluorescent Nitric Oxide (NO•) Probes, the geNOps, for Real-time Imaging of NO• Signals in Single Cells.","Nitric Oxide (NO•) is a small radical, which mediates multiple important cellular functions in mammals, bacteria and plants. Despite the existence of a large number of methods for detecting NO• in vivo and in vitro, the real-time monitoring of NO• at the single-cell level is very challenging. The physiological or pathological effects of NO• are determined by the actual concentration and dwell time of this radical. Accordingly, methods that allow the single-cell detection of NO• are highly desirable. Recently, we expanded the pallet of NO• indicators by introducing single fluorescent protein-based genetically encoded nitric oxide (NO•) probes (geNOps) that directly respond to cellular NO• fluctuations and, hence, addresses this need. Here we demonstrate the usage of geNOps to assess intracellular NO• signals in response to two different chemical NO•-liberating molecules. Our results also confirm that freshly prepared 3-(2-hydroxy-1-methyl-2-nitrosohydrazino)-N-methyl-1-propanamine (NOC-7) has a much higher potential to evoke change in intracellular NO• levels as compared with the inorganic NO• donor sodium nitroprusside (SNP). Furthermore, dual-color live-cell imaging using the green geNOps (G-geNOp) and the chemical Ca2+ indicator fura-2 was performed to visualize the tight regulation of Ca2+-dependent NO• formation in single endothelial cells. These representative experiments demonstrate that geNOps are suitable tools to investigate the real-time generation and degradation of single-cell NO• signals in diverse experimental setups.","['Animals', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Endothelial Cells', 'Fluorescent Dyes', 'Fura-2', 'Genetic Vectors', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Hydrazines', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Nitric Oxide', 'Nitric Oxide Donors', 'Nitroprusside', 'Parvovirinae']",28362417,"[['B01.050'], ['A11.251'], ['A11.436.275'], ['D27.720.233.348', 'D27.720.470.410.505.500'], ['D03.383.129.462.285', 'D03.633.100.127.250'], ['G05.360.337'], ['A11.251.210.172.750', 'A11.436.334'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D02.442'], ['E01.370.350.515.458', 'E05.595.458'], ['D01.339.387', 'D01.625.550.500', 'D01.625.700.500', 'D01.650.550.587.600'], ['D27.505.519.656', 'D27.505.954.411.590'], ['D01.248.497.158.291.350.550', 'D01.490.100.300.550', 'D01.625.400.100.325.550'], ['B04.280.580.650']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
A head above the rest: height and adolescent psychological well-being.,"Using data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, we examine the effect of adolescent height on mental health as measured by Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression (CES-D) scores and Rosenberg Self-Esteem (RSE) scores. We find evidence that height is associated with fewer symptoms of depression among females 17-19 years of age, and among males 12-19 years of age. The negative relationship between height and depression among males persists after controlling for body mass index (BMI), differences in pubertal timing, and individual fixed effects, but does not explain the effect of height on educational attainment. We conclude that there is a small psychological benefit for males to being taller as an adolescent.","['Adolescent', 'Body Height', 'Body Mass Index', 'Child', 'Depression', 'Educational Status', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Male', 'Mental Health', 'Psychology, Adolescent', 'Self Concept', 'United States', 'Young Adult']",19447690,"[['M01.060.057'], ['E01.370.600.115.100.160.100', 'E05.041.124.160.500', 'G07.100.100.160.100', 'G07.345.249.314.100'], ['E01.370.600.115.100.125', 'E05.041.124.125', 'G07.100.100.125', 'N06.850.505.200.100.175'], ['M01.060.406'], ['F01.145.126.350'], ['N01.824.196'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.500'], ['F02.418', 'N01.400.500'], ['F04.096.628.065'], ['F01.752.747.792'], ['Z01.107.567.875'], ['M01.060.116.815']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Geographicals [Z]']",0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1
Electrochemical DNA hybridization sensors based on conducting polymers.,"Conducting polymers (CPs) are a group of polymeric materials that have attracted considerable attention because of their unique electronic, chemical, and biochemical properties. This is reflected in their use in a wide range of potential applications, including light-emitting diodes, anti-static coating, electrochromic materials, solar cells, chemical sensors, biosensors, and drug-release systems. Electrochemical DNA sensors based on CPs can be used in numerous areas related to human health. This review summarizes the recent progress made in the development and use of CP-based electrochemical DNA hybridization sensors. We discuss the distinct properties of CPs with respect to their use in the immobilization of probe DNA on electrode surfaces, and we describe the immobilization techniques used for developing DNA hybridization sensors together with the various transduction methods employed. In the concluding part of this review, we present some of the challenges faced in the use of CP-based DNA hybridization sensors, as well as a future perspective.","['Biosensing Techniques', 'DNA', 'Electrochemistry', 'Humans', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'Polymers']",25664436,"[['E05.601.043'], ['D13.444.308'], ['H01.181.529.307'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E05.393.661', 'G02.111.611'], ['D05.750', 'D25.720', 'J01.637.051.720']]","['Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]']",0,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0

Special plant species determines diet breadth of phytophagous insects: a study on host plant expansion of the host-specialized Aphis gossypii Glover.,"Host specialization is a ubiquitous character of phytophagous insects. The polyphagous population is usually composed of some subpopulations that can use only a few closely related plants. Cotton-melon aphids, Aphis gossypii Glover exhibited strong host specialization, and the cotton- and cucurbits-specialized biotypes had been clearly identified. However, the experimental work that addressed the roles of plant species in determining diet breadth of phytophagous insects is rare. In the present study, we took the artificial host transfer method to assess the role of two special plants, zucchini Cucurbita zucchini L. and cowpea Vigna unguiculata (Linn.) Walp, in regulating diet breadth of cotton- and cucurbits-specialized A. gossypii collected from cotton and cucumber fields and reared separately on the native host plant for ten years. The results showed that the cotton-specialized aphids did not directly use cucumber whereas the cucurbits-specialized did not use cotton regardless of the coexistence or separation of cotton and cucumber plants. Neither of the cotton- and cucurbits-specialized aphids could use capsicum Capsicum annuum, eggplant Solanum melongenahttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carolus_Linnaeus, tomato Solanum lycopersicum, maize Zea mayshttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Linnaeus, and radish Raphanus sativus, however, both of them could use zucchini and cowpea. Moreover, the feeding experience on zucchini led the cotton-specialized aphids to use cucumber well and finally to be transformed into the cucurbits-specialized biotype. The short-term feeding experience on cowpea resulted in the diet breadth expansion of the cucurbits-specialized aphids to use cotton. On the other hand, the diet breadth expansion of the cucurbits- and cotton-specialized aphids was only realized by different species of plant. It concluded that the special host plant did induce the conversion of feeding habits in the cotton- and cucurbits-specialized aphids, and consequently broke the host specialization. The plant species is an underlying factor to determine the diet breadth of phytophagous insects.","['Animals', 'Aphids', 'Cucumis sativus', 'Diet', 'Ecosystem', 'Gossypium', 'Herbivory', 'Host Specificity', 'Plants', 'Population Dynamics']",23580128,"[['B01.050'], ['B01.050.500.131.617.412.165'], ['B01.650.940.800.575.912.250.300.188.666'], ['G07.203.650.240'], ['G16.500.275.157', 'N06.230.124'], ['B01.650.940.800.575.912.250.859.821.500.244'], ['F01.145.113.547.600', 'F01.145.407.758', 'G07.203.650.353.758'], ['G06.462.380', 'G16.527.200.380'], ['B01.650'], ['I01.240.600', 'N01.224.625', 'N06.850.505.400.700']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]']",0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0
A new centrally acting antihypertensive (ICI 106270) which separates antihypertensive effects from sedation.,"1. 6-(2-Chloro-6-fluorophenyl)-2,3,6,7-tetrahydro-5H-pyrrolo-[1,2-a]-imidazole hydrobromide (ICI 106270) has been developed with the objective of achieving satisfactory blood pressure (BP) reduction while minimising the side-effects seen with clonidine. 2. In the pentobarbitone sodium anaesthetised rat the dose of ICI 106270 to lower BP by 20 mmHg (ED20) was 5.45 micrograms/kg i.v. (ED20 clonidine 1.18 micrograms/kg i.v.). In conscious spontaneously hypertensive rats 10 mg/kg orally of ICI 106270 lowered BP by 70 +/- 12.2 mmHg. A similar fall in BP of 67 +/- 6.5 mmHg was seen with 1 mg/kg of clonidine orally. 3. In conscious renal-hypertensive dogs ICI 106270 is 2--3 times less potent than clonidine when dosed either p.o. or i.v. but was equipotent with clonidine at lowering BP when administered into a lateral cerebral ventricle. 4. Clonidine (250--750 micrograms/kg) administered i.p. in rats caused a marked potentiation of anaesthesia induced by pentobarbitone. ICI 106270 similarly administered in the same doses was without effect. 5. In a test for locomotor activity the ED50 (dose to reduce locomotor activity by 50%) was 15.3 micrograms/kg i.v. for clonidine and 237.5 micrograms/kg i.v. for ICI 106270. On oral administration the ED50 for clonidine was 26 micrograms/kg and for ICI 106270 it was 2.14 mg/kg. 6. In the chloralose anaesthetised cat pre- and post-ganglionic sympathetic efferent nerve activity was reduced by ICI 106270 in doses which also reduced BP. 7. The hypotensive effect of i.v. ICI 106270 in anaesthetised rats was antagonised by the alpha-adrenoceptor antagonists yohimbine and piperoxan. 8. These results indicate that ICI 106270 is a potent antihypertensive with a similar mechanism of action to clonidine although it is relatively less sedative. It is an alpha-stimulant and its site of action is probably within the CNS.","['Anesthesia', 'Animals', 'Antihypertensive Agents', 'Blood Pressure', 'Clonidine', 'Female', 'Heart Rate', 'Hypertension, Renal', 'Imidazoles', 'Motor Activity', 'Pentobarbital', 'Rats', 'Sleep', 'Sympathetic Nervous System']",7198445,"[['E03.155'], ['B01.050'], ['D27.505.954.411.162'], ['E01.370.600.875.249', 'G09.330.380.076'], ['D03.383.129.308.436.500'], ['E01.370.600.875.500', 'G09.330.380.500'], ['C12.777.419.331', 'C13.351.968.419.331', 'C14.907.489.631'], ['D03.383.129.308'], ['F01.145.632', 'G11.427.410.698'], ['D03.383.742.698.253.593'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700'], ['F02.830.855', 'G11.561.803'], ['A08.800.050.800']]","['Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Cost-effectiveness of renal denervation therapy for the treatment of resistant hypertension in The Netherlands.,"OBJECTIVES: Safety and efficacy data for catheter-based renal denervation (RDN) in the treatment of resistant hypertension have been used to estimate the cost-effectiveness of this approach. However, there are no Dutch-specific analyses. This study examined the cost-effectiveness of RDN from the perspective of the healthcare payer in The Netherlands.METHODS: A previously constructed Markov state-transition model was adapted and updated with costs and utilities relevant to the Dutch setting. The cost-effectiveness of RDN was compared with standard of care (SoC) for patients with resistant hypertension. The efficacy of RDN treatment was modeled as a reduction in the risk of cardiovascular events associated with a lower systolic blood pressure (SBP).RESULTS: Treatment with RDN compared to SoC gave an incremental quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gain of 0.89 at an additional cost of €1315 over a patient's lifetime, resulting in a base case incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of €1474. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses (PSA) showed that treatment with RDN therapy was cost-effective at conventional willingness-to-pay thresholds (€10,000-80,000/QALY).CONCLUSION: RDN is a cost-effective intervention for patients with resistant hypertension in The Netherlands.","['Aged', 'Cost-Benefit Analysis', 'Denervation', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hypertension', 'Kidney', 'Male', 'Markov Chains', 'Middle Aged', 'Models, Econometric', 'Netherlands', 'Quality-Adjusted Life Years']",25367314,"[['M01.060.116.100'], ['N03.219.151.125'], ['E04.525.210'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C14.907.489'], ['A05.810.453'], ['E05.318.740.600.500', 'E05.318.740.996.500', 'G17.830.500', 'N05.715.360.750.625.500', 'N05.715.360.750.770.500', 'N06.850.520.830.600.500', 'N06.850.520.830.996.500'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['E05.318.740.500.600.500', 'E05.599.835.890.500', 'N05.715.360.750.530.500.500', 'N06.850.520.830.500.600.500'], ['Z01.542.651'], ['E05.318.740.100.500.700', 'N01.224.935.530.700']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Geographicals [Z]']",1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1

Radiation for bone metastases in Ewing sarcoma and rhabdomyosarcoma.,"BACKGROUND: The role, optimal dose, and efficacy of radiotherapy (RT) for the treatment of bone metastases in rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) and Ewing sarcoma (ES) are unclear.PROCEDURE: All patients with ES or RMS who received RT for bone metastases with curative intent during frontline therapy at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) between 1995 and 2013 were reviewed. Among the 30 patients (8 RMS and 22 ES), 49 bone metastases were irradiated.RESULTS: Median biologically effective dose (BED) was 42.4 Gy (range, 34.9-59.7) for RMS and 50.7 Gy (range, 31.3-65.8) for ES. Tumor recurrence occurred in six of 49 irradiated bone metastases. Cumulative incidence of local failure at a treated metastatic site was 6.6% at 1 year and 9.0% at 3 years. Dose, fractionation, and RT technique did not impact local control at an irradiated site. The presence of >5 bone metastases was associated with worse local control at an irradiated site (P = 0.07). The 3-year EFS was 33% in RMS and 16% in ES.CONCLUSIONS: RT appears to be an effective modality of local control for bone metastases in ES and RMS. Local control at sites of metastatic bone irradiation is similar to local control at the primary site after definitive RT. Doses in the biologic range prescribed for the definitive treatment of primary disease should be used for metastatic sites of disease.","['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols', 'Bone Neoplasms', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Rhabdomyosarcoma', 'Sarcoma, Ewing']",25346208,"[['M01.060.057'], ['M01.060.116'], ['E02.183.750.500', 'E02.319.077.500', 'E02.319.310.037'], ['C04.588.149', 'C05.116.231'], ['M01.060.406'], ['M01.060.406.448'], ['G07.690.773.875', 'G07.690.936.500'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.703'], ['C04.697.650', 'C23.550.727.650'], ['E05.318.372.500.500.500', 'E05.318.372.500.750.750', 'N05.715.360.330.500.500.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.825', 'N06.850.520.450.500.500.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.825'], ['C04.557.450.590.550.660', 'C04.557.450.795.550.660'], ['C04.557.450.565.575.650.800', 'C04.557.450.795.620.800']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Health Care [N]']",0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
Maternal diet and risk of astrocytic glioma in children: a report from the Childrens Cancer Group (United States and Canada),"N-nitroso compounds and their precursors, nitrites and nitrates, have been hypothesized as risk factors, and vitamins C and E, which inhibit N-nitroso formation, as protective factors for brain tumors. A case-control study of maternal diet during pregnancy and risk of astrocytoma, the most common childhood brain tumor, was conducted by the Childrens Cancer Group. The study included 155 cases under age six at diagnosis and the same number of matched controls selected by random-digit dialing. A trend was observed for consumption of cured meats, which contain preformed nitrosamines (a class of N-nitroso compounds) and their precursors (adjusted odds ratio [OR] for highest quartile of intake relative to lowest = 1.7, P trend = 0.10). However, no strong trends were observed for nitrosamine (OR = 0.8, P = 0.60); nitrite (OR = 1.3, P = 0.54); nitrate (OR = 0.7, P = 0.43); vitamin C (OR = 0.7, P = 0.37); or vitamin E (OR = 0.7, P = 0.48). Iron supplements were associated with a significant decrease in risk (OR = 0.5, 95 percent confidence interval = 0.3-0.8). The effect of several dietary factors differed by income level, making interpretation of the results difficult. Future research should investigate the effect of dietary components not assessed in this study, as these may explain the disparate effects by income level. The results of this study provide limited support for the nitrosamine hypothesis.","['Astrocytoma', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Canada', 'Carotenoids', 'Child, Preschool', 'Diet', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Income', 'Iron', 'Meat', 'Neuroectodermal Tumors, Primitive', 'Nitroso Compounds', 'Pregnancy', 'Risk Factors', 'United States', 'Vitamin A', 'Vitamin E', 'beta Carotene']",8167265,"[['C04.557.465.625.600.380.080', 'C04.557.470.670.380.080', 'C04.557.580.625.600.380.080'], ['C04.588.614.250.195', 'C10.228.140.211', 'C10.551.240.250'], ['Z01.107.567.176'], ['D02.455.326.271.665.202', 'D02.455.426.392.368.367.379.249', 'D02.455.849.131', 'D23.767.261'], ['M01.060.406.448'], ['G07.203.650.240'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['N01.824.417'], ['D01.268.556.412', 'D01.268.956.287', 'D01.552.544.412'], ['G07.203.300.600', 'J02.500.600'], ['C04.557.465.625.600.590', 'C04.557.470.670.590', 'C04.557.580.625.600.590'], ['D02.654'], ['G08.686.784.769'], ['E05.318.740.600.800.725', 'N05.715.350.200.700', 'N05.715.360.750.625.700.700', 'N06.850.490.625.750', 'N06.850.520.830.600.800.725'], ['Z01.107.567.875'], ['D02.455.326.271.665.202.495.818', 'D02.455.426.392.368.367.379.249.700.860', 'D02.455.849.131.495.818', 'D02.455.849.291.925', 'D23.767.261.700.860'], ['D03.383.663.283.909', 'D03.633.100.150.909'], ['D02.455.326.271.665.202.123', 'D02.455.426.392.368.367.379.249.050', 'D02.455.849.131.123', 'D23.767.261.050']]","['Diseases [C]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,1

Alkali-templated surface nanopatterning of chalcogenide thin films: a novel approach toward solar cells with enhanced efficiency.,"Concepts of localized contacts and junctions through surface passivation layers are already advantageously applied in Si wafer-based photovoltaic technologies. For Cu(In,Ga)Se2 thin film solar cells, such concepts are generally not applied, especially at the heterojunction, because of the lack of a simple method yielding features with the required size and distribution. Here, we show a novel, innovative surface nanopatterning approach to form homogeneously distributed nanostructures (<30 nm) on the faceted, rough surface of polycrystalline chalcogenide thin films. The method, based on selective dissolution of self-assembled and well-defined alkali condensates in water, opens up new research opportunities toward development of thin film solar cells with enhanced efficiency.","['Alkalies', 'Nanostructures', 'Solar Energy', 'Sunlight', 'Water']",25844923,"[['D01.045'], ['J01.637.512'], ['G01.750.897', 'N06.230.132.644.500'], ['G01.358.500.505.650.836', 'G01.750.250.650.836', 'G01.750.770.578.836', 'G16.500.275.063.725.525', 'G16.500.750.775.525', 'N06.230.300.100.725.525'], ['D01.045.250.875', 'D01.248.497.158.459.650', 'D01.650.550.925']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Health Care [N]']",0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0
Diet-induced regulation of bitter taste receptor subtypes in the mouse gastrointestinal tract.,"Bitter taste receptors and signaling molecules, which detect bitter taste in the mouth, are expressed in the gut mucosa. In this study, we tested whether two distinct bitter taste receptors, the bitter taste receptor 138 (T2R138), selectively activated by isothiocyanates, and the broadly tuned bitter taste receptor 108 (T2R108) are regulated by luminal content. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis showed that T2R138 transcript is more abundant in the colon than the small intestine and lowest in the stomach, whereas T2R108 mRNA is more abundant in the stomach compared to the intestine. Both transcripts in the stomach were markedly reduced by fasting and restored to normal levels after 4 hours re-feeding. A cholesterol-lowering diet, mimicking a diet naturally low in cholesterol and rich in bitter substances, increased T2R138 transcript, but not T2R108, in duodenum and jejunum, and not in ileum and colon. Long-term ingestion of high-fat diet increased T2R138 RNA, but not T2R108, in the colon. Similarly, á-gustducin, a bitter taste receptor signaling molecule, was reduced by fasting in the stomach and increased by lowering cholesterol in the small intestine and by high-fat diet in the colon. These data show that both short and long term changes in the luminal contents alter expression of bitter taste receptors and associated signaling molecules in the mucosa, supporting the proposed role of bitter taste receptors in luminal chemosensing in the gastrointestinal tract. Bitter taste receptors might serve as regulatory and defensive mechanism to control gut function and food intake and protect the body from the luminal environment.","['Animals', 'Colon', 'Diet', 'Diet, High-Fat', 'Duodenum', 'Fasting', 'Gastric Mucosa', 'Gastrointestinal Tract', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Heterotrimeric GTP-Binding Proteins', 'Ileum', 'Intestine, Small', 'Jejunum', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'RNA, Messenger', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled', 'Signal Transduction', 'Taste']",25238152,"[['B01.050'], ['A03.556.124.526.356', 'A03.556.249.249.356'], ['G07.203.650.240'], ['G07.203.650.240.267'], ['A03.556.124.684.124', 'A03.556.875.249'], ['F01.145.407.400', 'G07.203.650.240.587', 'G07.203.650.353.400'], ['A03.556.875.875.440', 'A10.615.550.291'], ['A03.556'], ['G05.308'], ['D08.811.277.040.330.300.200', 'D12.644.360.360', 'D12.776.157.325.332', 'D12.776.476.375', 'D12.776.543.325'], ['A03.556.124.684.249', 'A03.556.249.124'], ['A03.556.124.684'], ['A03.556.124.684.500', 'A03.556.249.750'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500'], ['B01.050.050.199.520.520.420', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500.400.420'], ['D13.444.735.544'], ['E05.393.620.500.706'], ['D12.776.543.750.695'], ['G02.111.820', 'G04.835'], ['F02.830.816.724', 'G11.561.790.724']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Determination of quinolone residues in tilapias (Orechromis niloticus) by HPLC-FLD and LC-MS/MS QToF.,"A method for the simultaneous determination of flumequine, oxolinic acid, sarafloxacin, danofloxacin, enrofloxacin, and ciprofloxacin in tilapia (Orechromis niloticus) fillet, using high-performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection (HPLC-FLD) is presented. The quinolones were extracted from the food matrix with a solution of 10% trichloroacetic acid and methanol (80:20 v/v). Clean-up of the extract was performed using polymeric solid-phase extraction cartridges. Identification of the quinolones was confirmed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The HPLC-FLD method was validated in-house and the following analytical parameters were obtained: linearity higher than 0.99 for all the quinolones; intra- and interassay precisions were lower than 3.5% and 10.9%, respectively; and recoveries ranged from 73% to 110%. The limit of quantification was below the maximum residue limit established by the Joint Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA), which indicates that the method is appropriate for the determination of quinolones in fish fillet.","['Animals', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Chromatography, Liquid', 'Drug Residues', 'Fluorescence', 'Fluoroquinolones', 'Food Analysis', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry', 'Tilapia']",21462582,"[['B01.050'], ['D27.505.954.122.085'], ['E05.196.181.400.300'], ['E05.196.181.400'], ['N06.850.460.200.250'], ['G01.358.500.505.650.665.500', 'G01.590.540.665.500'], ['D03.633.100.810.835.322'], ['E05.362', 'J01.576.423.850.100'], ['E05.196.566.880'], ['B01.050.150.900.493.602.200.800']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]']",0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0
Patterning of cell-instructive hydrogels by hydrodynamic flow focusing.,"Microfluidic gradient systems offer a very precise means to probe the response of cells to graded biomolecular signals in vitro, for example to model how morphogen proteins affect cell fate during developmental processes. However, existing gradient makers are designed for non-physiological plastic or glass cell culture substrates that are often limited in maintaining the phenotype and function of difficult-to-culture mammalian cell types, such as stem cells. To address this bottleneck, we combine hydrogel engineering and microfluidics to generate tethered protein gradients on the surface of biomimetic poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) hydrogels. Here we used software-assisted hydrodynamic flow focusing for exposing and rapidly capturing tagged proteins to gels in a step-wise fashion, resulting in immobilized gradients of virtually any desired shape and composition. To render our strategy amenable for high-throughput screening of multifactorial artificial cellular microenvironments, a dedicated microfluidic chip was devised for parallelization and multiplexing, yielding arrays of orthogonally overlapping gradients of up to 4 ? 4 proteins. To illustrate the power of the platform for stem cell biology, we assessed how gradients of tethered leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) influence embryonic stem cell (ESC) behavior. ESC responded to LIF gradients in a binary manner, maintaining the pluripotency marker Rex1/Zfp42 and forming self-renewing colonies above a threshold concentration of 85 ng cm(-2). Our concept should be broadly applicable to probe how complex signaling microenvironments influence stem cell fate in culture.","['Animals', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Embryonic Stem Cells', 'Hydrodynamics', 'Hydrogels', 'Mice', 'Microfluidic Analytical Techniques', 'Polyethylene Glycols', 'Protein Engineering', 'Software', 'Surface Properties']",23598796,"[['B01.050'], ['A11.251'], ['A11.872.700.250'], ['G01.342'], ['D20.280.320.375', 'D26.255.165.320.375'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500'], ['E05.588.465'], ['D02.033.455.250.700', 'D05.750.741', 'D25.720.741', 'J01.637.051.720.741'], ['E05.393.420.601'], ['L01.224.900'], ['G02.860']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]', 'Information Science [L]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0
Mitotic activity in the blastema and stump tissues of regenerating hind limbs of Xenopus laevis larvae after amputation at ankle level. An autoradiographic study.,"Mitotic activity, as indicated by DNA synthesis, was studied by autoradiographic analysis along the proximodistal axis of regenerating limbs in the early and later larval stages 53 and 57 of Xenopus laevis. Wound-healing, dedifferentiation, blastema formation and growth phases were studied. Most of the various stump tissues, as well as the cell mass of the regeneration blastema, were involved. The study showed an increase in DNA synthesis in the stump tissues during their dedifferentiation as well as during blastema formation. The increase was confined mainly to the distal portion (close to the amputation level), so that a proximodistal gradient was discernible. This could be regarded as valid evidence of contribution of the severed stump tissues to the blastema cells. The mesenchymal blastema cells formed after amputation at stage 53 displayed higher mitotic activity than the fibrocytoid blastema cells formed at stage 57. Although the latter were more differentiated than the former, they still showed DNA replication and mitotic division.","['Amputation Stumps', 'Animals', 'Autoradiography', 'Hindlimb', 'Mitosis', 'Regeneration', 'Tarsus, Animal', 'Xenopus laevis']",2341072,"[['A01.378.100'], ['B01.050'], ['E01.370.225.750.132', 'E05.200.750.132', 'E05.799.256'], ['A13.473'], ['G04.144.220.220.781', 'G05.113.220.781'], ['G16.762'], ['A13.473.821'], ['B01.050.150.900.090.180.610.500.562']]","['Anatomy [A]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Modeling pulmonary kinetics of 2-deoxy-2-[18F]fluoro-D-glucose during acute lung injury.,"RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: Dynamic positron emission tomographic imaging of the radiotracer 2-deoxy-2-[(18)F]fluoro-D-glucose ((18)F-FDG) is increasingly used to assess metabolic activity of lung inflammatory cells. To analyze the kinetics of (18)F-FDG in brain and tumor tissues, the Sokoloff model has been typically used. In the lungs, however, a high blood-to-parenchymal volume ratio and (18)F-FDG distribution in edematous injured tissue could require a modified model to properly describe (18)F-FDG kinetics.MATERIALS AND METHODS: We developed and validated a new model of lung (18)F-FDG kinetics that includes an extravascular/noncellular compartment in addition to blood and (18)F-FDG precursor pools for phosphorylation. Parameters obtained from this model were compared with those obtained using the Sokoloff model. We analyzed dynamic PET data from 15 sheep with smoke or ventilator-induced lung injury.RESULTS: In the majority of injured lungs, the new model provided better fit to the data than the Sokoloff model. Rate of pulmonary (18)F-FDG net uptake and distribution volume in the precursor pool for phosphorylation correlated between the two models (R(2)=0.98, 0.78), but were overestimated with the Sokoloff model by 17% (P< .05) and 16% (P< .0005) compared to the new one. The range of the extravascular/noncellular (18)F-FDG distribution volumes was up to 13% and 49% of lung tissue volume in smoke- and ventilator-induced lung injury, respectively.CONCLUSION: The lung-specific model predicted (18)F-FDG kinetics during acute lung injury more accurately than the Sokoloff model and may provide new insights in the pathophysiology of lung injury.","['Analysis of Variance', 'Animals', 'Fluorodeoxyglucose F18', 'Models, Biological', 'Radionuclide Imaging', 'Radiopharmaceuticals', 'Respiratory Distress Syndrome', 'Sheep']",18486012,"[['E05.318.740.150', 'N05.715.360.750.125', 'N06.850.520.830.150'], ['B01.050'], ['D09.254.229.500'], ['E05.599.395'], ['E01.370.350.710', 'E01.370.384.730'], ['D27.505.259.843', 'D27.505.519.871', 'D27.720.470.410.650'], ['C08.381.840', 'C08.618.840'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.500.380.791']]","['Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Diseases [C]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
Is dauer pheromone of Caenorhabditis elegans really a pheromone?,"Animals respond to signals and cues in their environment. The difference between a signal (e.g. a pheromone) and a cue (e.g. a waste product) is that the information content of a signal is subject to natural selection, whereas that of a cue is not. The model free-living nematode Caenorhabditis elegans forms an alternative developmental morph (the dauer larva) in response to a so-called 'dauer pheromone', produced by all worms. We suggest that the production of 'dauer pheromone' has no fitness advantage for an individual worm and therefore we propose that 'dauer pheromone' is not a signal, but a cue.

Ophthalmomyiasis externa: three cases caused by Oestrus ovis larvae in Turkey.,"Ocular involvement of parasitic infections includes external, internal and orbital ophthalmomyiasis.

We describe three cases of external ophthalmomyiasis due to infestation with the first instar larvae of O. ovis An awareness of larval conjunctivitis in endemic areas may avoid misdiagnosis and allow immediate management to prevent complications.","['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Animals', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Diptera', 'Eye Infections, Parasitic', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Larva', 'Male', 'Myiasis', 'Sheep', 'Turkey']",24705772,"[['M01.060.057'], ['M01.060.116'], ['B01.050'], ['E01.171'], ['B01.050.500.131.617.720.500.500.750'], ['C01.610.300', 'C11.294.725'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['B05.500.500', 'G07.345.500.550.500.500'], ['C01.610.858.211.503'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.500.380.791'], ['Z01.252.245.500.850']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Geographicals [Z]']",0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1
The Early Postoperative Effects of Cochlear Implantation on Horizontal Semicircular Canal Function.,"OBJECTIVES: To use video head impulse testing to examine the effect of cochlear implantation (CI) on horizontal SCC vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) gain early after surgery, and to relate outcomes to subjective imbalance.STUDY DESIGN: Prospective cohort study.SETTING: Academic tertiary referral center.PATIENTS: Thirty-seven (23F:14M) adult cochlear implant recipients (mean age, 55; age range, 20-80).INTERVENTION: Cochlear implantation.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The VOR of the horizontal semicircular canal of both the operated and non-operated ears was examined using video head impulse testing before surgery and at days 1, 7, and 28 following surgery. VOR gain, VOR gain asymmetry, and the change in VOR gain from preoperative baseline where the primary outcome measures. Subjective imbalance was assessed using a structured questionnaire.RESULTS: VOR gain value for the operated ear was 0.88 ± 0.21. Mean VOR gain on day 1 postoperatively was 0.86 ± 0.19; on day 7, 0.87 ± 0.17, and on day 30, 0.91 ± 0.21. Before surgery median asymmery was -5.50%, on day 1 it was -5.30%, at day 7, -6.44%, and at day 30 it was -2.61%. There was no significant difference between these measures for the cohort across the four time points. Thirteen of 37 (35%) of patients experienced imbalance in the follow-up period, but this was not correlated to changes in VOR gain.CONCLUSION: Horizontal semicircular canal function is preserved in the immediate and early postoperative period. This suggests that horizontal semicircular canal impairment is not likely to be responsible for postoperative imbalance.","['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cochlear Implantation', 'Cochlear Implants', 'Female', 'Head Impulse Test', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Postoperative Complications', 'Postoperative Period', 'Postural Balance', 'Prospective Studies', 'Reflex, Vestibulo-Ocular', 'Semicircular Canals', 'Sensation Disorders', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Young Adult']",29995005,"[['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['M01.060.116.100.080'], ['E04.580.450.220', 'E04.650.220'], ['E07.305.250.319.381.500.500', 'E07.695.150', 'E07.695.202.381.500.500', 'E07.814.458.150'], ['E01.370.382.900.640'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['C23.550.767'], ['E04.614.750', 'N02.421.585.753.750'], ['F02.830.816.541.752', 'G07.888.750.500', 'G11.427.690', 'G11.561.790.541.595'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.625', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.650', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.650'], ['G07.888.937', 'G11.561.731.795'], ['A09.246.300.663'], ['C10.597.751', 'C23.888.592.763'], ['E05.318.308.980', 'N05.715.360.300.800', 'N06.850.520.308.980'], ['M01.060.116.815']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
Identification of the most sensitive and robust immunohistochemical markers in different categories of ovarian sex cord-stromal tumors.,"Different immunohistochemical sex cord-stromal markers have been previously studied in various types of ovarian sex cord-stromal tumors; however, the sensitivity for sex cord-stromal lineage may vary between markers, and some markers may not be as sensitive in some types of sex cord-stromal tumors compared with other tumors in this spectrum of neoplasms. The goals of this study were to determine which immunohistochemical markers are the most sensitive and immunohistochemically robust for sex cord-stromal lineage within a given type of ovarian sex cord-stromal tumor, and to establish whether there are substantial differences of expression of these markers between different types of sex cord-stromal tumors. Immunohistochemical stains for markers which have known variable specificity for sex cord-stromal lineage [inhibin, calretinin, MART-1/melan-A, CD99, steroidogenic factor 1 (SF-1, adrenal 4-binding protein), and WT1], were performed in 127 cases of 5 different types of ovarian sex cord-stromal tumors: adult granulosa cell tumor (n=32), Sertoli cell tumor (n=27), Sertoli-Leydig cell tumor (n=18), steroid cell tumor (n=25), and fibroma/fibrothecoma (n=25). All cases in each type of sex cord-stromal tumor expressed SF-1. Inhibin and calretinin were expressed in all groups of tumors but with a lesser frequency (56% to 100% and 36% to 100% of cases, respectively). All types of tumors except steroid cell tumor expressed WT1. Fibroma/fibrothecoma was the only type of tumor that did not express CD99. The only tumor groups that showed expression of MART-1 were Sertoli-Leydig cell tumor (restricted to the Leydig cell component) and steroid cell tumor (94% and 96% of cases, respectively). The type of sex cord-stromal tumor that was least frequently positive for several of the different markers studied was fibroma/fibrothecoma. Among all tumor groups combined, inhibin and WT1 were the 2 markers showing the most diffuse expression. Likewise, the single marker showing the most optimal combination of diffuse and strong staining (immunohistochemical composite score: possible range, 1 to 12) varied between tumors: adult granulosa cell tumor-inhibin (score 10.0); Sertoli cell tumor-WT1 (score 10.8); Sertoli-Leydig cell tumor (Sertoli cell component)-WT1 (score 10.4); steroid cell tumor-inhibin (score 11.2); and fibroma/fibrothecoma-WT1 (score 8.9). We conclude that most immunohistochemical sex cord-stromal markers have sufficient sensitivity for sex cord-stromal lineage. Although each of the different types of sex cord-stromal tumors has a slightly unique immunoprofile in terms of frequency and extent of expression, these differences are relatively minor for most types of tumors with certain exceptions (eg, WT1 is not diagnostically useful in steroid cell tumor; CD99 is not diagnostically useful in fibroma/fibrothecoma; the only sex cord-stromal tumor for which MART-1 is diagnostically useful is steroid cell tumor; inhibin and calretinin are less diagnostically useful in fibroma/fibrothecoma than in the other types of tumors, but expression in fibrothecoma was higher than in fibroma). SF-1 is the most sensitive sex cord-stromal marker among the most common types of sex cord-stromal tumors. Given the findings relating to sensitivity and extent of expression in this study, and known specificity in the literature, the most informative sex cord-stromal markers to be used for the distinction from nonsex cord-stromal tumors are inhibin, calretinin, SF-1, and WT1 (the exact number of markers to be used should be based on the degree of difficulty of the case and level of experience of the pathologist); however, the utility of immunohistochemistry for the diagnosis of fibroma/fibrothecoma is somewhat limited.","['Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Ovarian Neoplasms', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sex Cord-Gonadal Stromal Tumors']",19033865,"[['D23.101.140'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E01.370.225.500.607.512', 'E01.370.225.750.551.512', 'E05.200.500.607.512', 'E05.200.750.551.512', 'E05.478.583', 'H01.158.100.656.234.512', 'H01.158.201.344.512', 'H01.158.201.486.512', 'H01.181.122.573.512', 'H01.181.122.605.512'], ['C04.588.322.455', 'C13.351.500.056.630.705', 'C13.351.937.418.685', 'C19.344.410', 'C19.391.630.705'], ['E05.318.370.800', 'E05.318.740.872', 'G17.800', 'N05.715.360.325.700', 'N05.715.360.750.725', 'N06.850.520.445.800', 'N06.850.520.830.872'], ['C04.557.475.750']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Health Care [N]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0
Adjacent segment stenosis after lumbar fusion requiring second operation.,"BACKGROUND: Whereas degeneration of the segment adjacent to lumbar fusion has been often seen on radiographs, a small number of patients with such degenerative changes undergo reoperation. Most follow-up studies have focused on adjacent segment disease based on analysis of radiographs. The present study was conducted to understand the pathology of reoperation cases of adjacent segment disease and factors associated with this condition. Operative indication was consistently restricted to patients with neurological involvement.METHODS: The subjects were 117 patients who had undergone posterior lumbar fusion and were followed for a minimum of 2 years (mean 7 years). Among them, nine patients (7.7%) required a second operation owing to symptomatic adjacent segment disease (stenosis). The reoperation rate was assessed in relation to sex, age, initial pathologic condition, and initial spinal fusion and decompression methods. Data were analyzed in a 2 x 2 cross contingency table using Fisher's exact probability test. A probability of <0.05 was defined as statistically significant.RESULTS: Of the variables examined, only multilevel fusion was associated with a high rate of reoperation with statistical significance (P < 0.04). Two patients (100%) suffering from loss of coronal balance (degenerative scoliosis) also required a second operation.CONCLUSIONS: The reoperation rate of 7.7% for adjacent segment disease in this study was consistent with the prevalence of adjacent segment stenosis in the literature. Given the risk of later occurrence of adjacent segment stenosis following multisegment posterolateral fusion, correction of coronal and sagittal balance, preventive decompression of the adjacent segment, or selective decompression without fusion may have to be considered as an additional or alternative procedure.","['Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Reoperation', 'Spinal Fusion', 'Spinal Stenosis']",16193361,"[['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.249', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.350', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.350'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['E04.690'], ['E04.555.100.700'], ['C05.116.900.825']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]']",0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
Allogeneic Mesenchymal Stromal Cells Transplanted Onto the Heart Surface Achieve Therapeutic Myocardial Repair Despite Immunologic Responses in Rats.,"BACKGROUND: Transplantation of allogeneic mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) is a promising treatment for heart failure. We have shown that epicardial placement of cell sheets markedly increases donor cell survival and augments therapeutic effects compared with the current methods. Although immune rejection of intramyocardially injected allogeneic MSCs have been suggested, allogeneic MSCs transplanted on the heart surface (virtual space) may undergo different courses. This study aimed to elucidate immunologic response against epicardially placed allogeneic MSCs, rejection or acceptance of these cells, and their therapeutic effects for heart failure.METHODS AND RESULTS: At 4 weeks after coronary artery ligation, Lewis rats underwent epicardial placement of MSC sheets from syngeneic Lewis or allogeneic Fischer 344 rats or sham treatment. At days 3 and 10 after treatment, similar ratios (?50% and 30%, respectively) of grafted MSCs survived on the heart surface in both MSC sheet groups. By day 28, survival of syngeneic MSCs was substantially reduced (8.9%); survival of allogeneic MSCs was more extensively reduced (0.2%), suggesting allorejection. Correspondingly, allogeneic MSCs were found to have evoked an immunologic response, albeit low level, as characterized by accumulation of CD4(+) T cells and upregulation of interleukin 6. Despite this alloimmune response, the allogeneic MSC sheet achieved myocardial upregulation of reparative factors, enhanced repair of the failing myocardium, and improved cardiac function to the equivalent degree observed for the syngeneic MSC sheet.CONCLUSIONS: Allogeneic MSCs placed on the heart surface evoked an immunologic response; however, this allowed sufficient early phase donor cell survival to induce equivalent therapeutic benefits to syngeneic MSCs. Further development of this approach toward clinical application is warranted.","['Animals', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes', 'Cell Survival', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Graft Rejection', 'Graft Survival', 'Heart Failure', 'Interleukin-6', 'Male', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Myocardium', 'Rats, Inbred F344', 'Rats, Inbred Lew', 'Recovery of Function', 'Regeneration', 'Stroke Volume', 'Time Factors', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Ventricular Function, Left']",26896478,"[['B01.050'], ['A11.118.637.555.567.569.200', 'A15.145.229.637.555.567.569.200', 'A15.382.490.555.567.569.200'], ['G04.346'], ['A11.251'], ['C22.232', 'E05.598.500', 'E05.599.395.080'], ['G12.875.545.328'], ['G12.875.545.340'], ['C14.280.434'], ['D12.644.276.374.465.224', 'D12.776.467.374.465.202', 'D23.529.374.465.224'], ['E02.095.147.500.500.625', 'E04.936.225.687.625'], ['A11.329.830.500', 'A11.872.590.500'], ['C14.280.647.500', 'C14.907.585.500', 'C23.550.513.355.750', 'C23.550.717.489.750'], ['A02.633.580', 'A07.541.704', 'A10.690.552.750'], ['B01.050.050.199.520.760.200', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700.400.200'], ['B01.050.050.199.520.760.280', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700.400.280'], ['G16.757'], ['G16.762'], ['E01.370.370.380.150.700', 'G09.330.380.124.882'], ['G01.910.857'], ['E04.936.864'], ['G09.330.955.800']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
"t10,c12-Conjugated linoleic acid stimulates mammary tumor progression in Her2/ErbB2 mice through activation of both proliferative and survival pathways.","The t10,c12 isomer of conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) inhibits rat mammary carcinogenesis, metastasis from a transplantable mouse mammary tumor and angiogenesis; however, it stimulates mammary tumorigenesis in transgenic mice overexpressing ErbB2 in the mammary epithelium (ErbB2 transgenic mice). In the current study, we report that a 4-week supplementation of the diet with 0.5% trans-10, cis-12 conjugated linoleic acid (t10,c12-CLA) stimulated the growth of established ErbB2-overexpressing mammary tumors by 30% and increased the number of new tumors from 11% to 82%. Additionally, when t10,c12-CLA supplementation of ErbB2 transgenic mice was initiated at 21 weeks of age, a time just prior to tumor appearance, overall survival was decreased from 46.4 weeks in the control to 39.0 weeks in the CLA group, and survival after detection of a palpable tumor from 7.5 to 4.6 weeks. Short-term supplementation from 10 to 14 weeks or 21 to 25 weeks of age temporarily accelerated tumor development, but over the long term, there was no significant effect on mammary tumorigenesis. Long term as well as a short 4-week supplementation increased mammary epithelial hyperplasia and lobular development, and altered the mammary stroma; this was reversible in mice returned to the control diet. t10,c12-CLA altered proliferation and apoptosis of the mammary epithelium, although this differed depending on the length of administration and/or the age of the mice. The increased tumor development with t10,c12-CLA was associated with increased phosphorylation of the IGF-I/insulin receptor, as well as increased signaling through the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt pathways; however, neither phospho-ErbB2 nor ErbB2 was altered.","['Administration, Oral', 'Animals', 'Diet', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Genes, erbB-2', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Linoleic Acids, Conjugated', 'Mammary Glands, Animal', 'Mammary Neoplasms, Experimental', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic']",18339686,"[['E02.319.267.100'], ['B01.050'], ['G07.203.650.240'], ['C23.550.291.656'], ['G05.360.340.024.340.375.500.791.295.305'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E01.370.225.500.607.512', 'E01.370.225.750.551.512', 'E05.200.500.607.512', 'E05.200.750.551.512', 'E05.478.583', 'H01.158.100.656.234.512', 'H01.158.201.344.512', 'H01.158.201.486.512', 'H01.181.122.573.512', 'H01.181.122.605.512'], ['D10.251.355.343.500.750'], ['A10.336.482', 'A13.589'], ['C04.588.531.500', 'C04.619.590', 'E05.598.500.496.843'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500'], ['B01.050.050.136.500', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500.800']]","['Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
A four-CRD C-type lectin from razor clam Sinonovacula constricta mediates agglutination and phagocytosis.,"C-type lectins are a superfamily of Ca2+-dependent carbohydrate-binding proteins that play crucial roles in invertebrate immunity. In this study, a novel C-type lectin gene (ScCTL-1) was identified in razor clam Sinonovacula constricta. The ScCTL-1 gene, consisting of four C-type carbohydrate recognition domains (CRDs) with an N-terminal signal peptide and a C-terminal transmembrane region. The gene is widely expressed in almost all tissues, with the highest expression in the hepatopancreas. To explore the functional characteristics of this structurally novel gene, tests of binding specificity, agglutinating activity, and phagocytic promoting activity were included in this study. Bacterial stimulation up-regulated ScCTL-1 expression in hemocytes. The binding activity of rScCTL-1 to bacteria was tested in vitro, and bacterial agglutination was observed under the same conditions. Ca2+ was essential for carbohydrate binding. Additionally, rScCTL-1 promoted the phagocytic activity of hemocytes to varying degrees against different bacteria, unlike the classical opsonin. These results suggest ScCTL-1 is a classical immune-related C-type lectin possessing unique immune-related properties.","['Agglutination', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Bivalvia', 'Carbohydrates', 'Hepatopancreas', 'Lectins, C-Type', 'Phagocytosis', 'Phylogeny', 'Protein Domains', 'Sequence Homology', 'Staphylococcal Infections', 'Staphylococcus aureus', 'Vibrio']",31843359,"[['G02.111.026', 'G12.122.100'], ['G02.111.570.060', 'L01.453.245.667.060'], ['B01.050'], ['B01.050.500.644.080'], ['D09'], ['A13.463'], ['D12.776.503.280'], ['G04.417.350', 'G09.188.665', 'G12.450.564.809', 'G12.688'], ['G05.697', 'G16.075.605', 'L01.100.697'], ['G02.111.570.820.709.275.750', 'G02.111.570.820.709.610.500'], ['G02.111.810', 'G05.810'], ['C01.150.252.410.868'], ['B03.300.390.400.800.750.100', 'B03.353.500.750.750.100', 'B03.510.100.750.750.100', 'B03.510.400.790.750.100'], ['B03.440.450.900.859', 'B03.660.250.830.830']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Diseases [C]']",1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
Evaluation of tRNA gene PCR for identification of mollicutes.,"We evaluated the applicability of tRNA gene PCR in combination with fluorescent capillary electrophoresis with an ABI310 genetic analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Calif.) for the identification of different mollicute species. A total of 103 strains and DNA extracts of 30 different species belonging to the genera Acholeplasma, Mycoplasma, and Ureaplasma were studied. Reproducible peak profiles were generated for all samples, except for one M. genitalium isolate, the three M. gallisepticum isolates, and 8 of the 24 Ureaplasma cultures, where no amplification could be obtained. Clustering revealed numerous discrepancies compared to the identifications that had been previously obtained by means of biochemical and serological tests. Final identification was obtained by 16S rRNA gene amplification followed by sequence analysis and/or restriction digestion. This confirmed the identification obtained by tRNA gene PCR in all cases. Seven samples yielded an unexpected tRNA gene PCR profile. Sequence analysis of the 16S rRNA genes showed that six of these samples were mixed and that one had a unique sequence that did not match any of the published sequences, pointing to the existence of a not-yet-described species. In conclusion, we found tRNA gene PCR to be a rapid and discriminatory method to correctly identify a large collection of different species of the class of Mollicutes and to recognize not-yet-described groups.","['Acholeplasma', 'Animals', 'Animals, Domestic', 'Bacterial Typing Techniques', 'Birds', 'Cattle', 'DNA, Bacterial', 'Genes, rRNA', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mycoplasma', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'RNA, Ribosomal, 16S', 'RNA, Transfer', 'Tenericutes', 'Ureaplasma']",16145107,"[['B03.440.860.074.150'], ['B01.050'], ['B01.050.050.116'], ['E01.370.225.875.150.125', 'E05.200.875.150.125'], ['B01.050.150.900.248'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.500.380.271'], ['D13.444.308.212'], ['G05.360.340.024.340.645.750'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500'], ['L01.453.245.667'], ['B03.440.860.580.553.553'], ['E05.393.620.500'], ['D13.444.735.686.670'], ['D13.444.735.757'], ['B03.440.860'], ['B03.440.860.580.553.900']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Information Science [L]']",0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
"Sequence analysis of the spliced-leader intergenic region (SL-IR) and random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) of Trypanosoma rangeli strains isolated from Rhodnius ecuadoriensis, R. colombiensis, R. pallescens and R. prolixus suggests a degree of co-evolution between parasites and vectors.","Spliced leader intergenic region (SL-IR) sequences from 23 Trypanosoma rangeli strains isolated from the salivary glands of Rhodnius colombiensis, R. ecuadoriensis, R. pallescens and R. prolixus and two human strains revealed the existence of 4 genotypes with CA, GT, TA, ATT and GTAT microsatellite repeats and the presence of insertions/deletions (INDEL) and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) characterizing each genotype. The strains isolated from the same vector species or the same Rhodnius evolutionary line presented the same genotypes, even in cases where strains had been isolated from vectors captured in geographically distant regions. The dendrogram constructed from the SL-IR sequences separated all of them into two main groups, one with the genotypes isolated from R. prolixus and the other group containing three well defined sub-groups with the genotypes isolated from R. pallescens, R. colombiensis and R. ecuadoriensis. Random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis showed the same two main groups and sub-groups supporting strict T. rangeli genotypes' association with Rhodnius species.

A Phase II trial of weekly bortezomib and dexamethasone in veterans with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma not eligible for or who deferred autologous stem cell transplantation.,"Once-weekly administration of bortezomib has reduced bortezomib-induced peripheral neuropathy without affecting response rates, but this has only been demonstrated prospectively in three- and four- drug combinations. We report a phase II trial of alternate dosing and schedule of bortezomib and dexamethasone in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients who are not eligible for or refused autologous stem cell transplantation. Bortezomib 1·6 mg/m(2) intravenously was given once-weekly for six cycles, together with dexamethasone 40 mg on the day of and day after bortezomib. Fifty patients were enrolled; 58% did not require any dose modification. The majority of patients had multiple co-morbidities, including cardiovascular (76%) and renal insufficiency (54%), and the median number of medications prior to enrollment was 13. Of all evaluable patients, the overall response rate was 79% and at least 45% had at least a very good partial response. The median time to first response was 1·3 months (range, 0·25-2·4 months). The progression-free and overall survivals were 8 months and 46·5 months, respectively. Twenty-four percent developed worsening neuropathy. We conclude that alternate dosing and scheduling of bortezomib and dexamethasone is both safe and effective for management of newly diagnosed multiple myeloma in frail patients.

Evolutionary relationships among genes for antibiotic resistance.,The genes that determine resistance to antibiotics are commonly found encoded by extrachromosomal elements in bacteria. These were described first in Enterobacteriaceae and subsequently in a variety of other genera; their spread is associated with the increased use of antibiotics in human and animal medicine. Antibiotic-resistance genes that determine the production of enzymes which modify (detoxify) the antibiotics have been detected in antibiotic-producing organisms. It has been suggested that the producing strains provided the source of antibiotic-resistance genes that were then 'picked-up' by recombination. Recent studies of the nucleotide sequence of certain antibiotic-resistance genes indicate regions of strong homology in the encoded proteins. The implications of these similarities are discussed.,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Aminoglycosides', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Bacteria', 'Biological Evolution', 'Drug Resistance, Microbial', 'Genes, Bacterial', 'Plasmids']",6559117,"[['G02.111.570.060', 'L01.453.245.667.060'], ['D09.408.051'], ['D27.505.954.122.085'], ['B03'], ['G05.045', 'G16.075'], ['G06.225', 'G07.690.773.984.269'], ['G05.360.340.024.340.364.249', 'G05.360.340.358.024.249', 'G05.360.340.358.207.249'], ['G05.360.600']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]']",0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
Evidence that functional glutamate receptors are not expressed on rat or human cerebromicrovascular endothelial cells.,"Excitatory amino acids can modify the tone of cerebral vessels and permeability of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) by acting directly on endothelial cells of cerebral vessels or indirectly by activating receptors expressed on other brain cells. In this study we examined whether rat or human cerebromicrovascular endothelial cells (CEC) express ionotropic and metabotropic glutamate receptors. Glutamate and the glutamate receptor agonists N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA), alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-isoxazole-4-propionic acid (AMPA), and kainate failed to increase [Ca2+]i in either rat or human microvascular and capillary CEC but elicited robust responses in primary rat cortical neurons, as measured by fura-2 fluorescence. The absence of NMDA and AMPA receptors in rat and human CEC was further confirmed by the lack of immunocytochemical staining of cells by antibodies specific for the AMPA receptor subunits GluR1, GluR2/3, and GluR4 and the NMDA receptor subunits NR1, NR2A, and NR2B. We failed to detect mRNA expression of the AMPA receptor subunits GluR1 to GluR4 or the NMDA receptor subunits NR1(1XX); NR1(0XX), and NR2A to NR2C in both freshly isolated rat and human microvessels and cultured CEC using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Cultured rat CEC expressed mRNA for KA1 or KA2 and GluR5 subunits. Primary rat cortical neurons were found to express GluR1 to GluR3 and NR1, NR2A, and NR2B by both immunocytochemistry and RT-PCR and KA1, KA2, GluR5, GluR6, and GluR7 by RT-PCR. Moreover, the metabotropic glutamate receptor agonist 1-amino-cyclopentyl-1S, 3R-dicorboxylate (1S,3R-trans-ACPD), while eliciting both inositol trisphosphate and [Ca2+]i increases and inhibiting forskolin-stimulated cyclic AMP in cortical neurons, was unable to induce either of these responses in rat or human CEC. These results strongly suggest that both rat and human CEC do not express functional glutamate receptors. Therefore, excitatory amino acid-induced changes in the cerebral microvascular tone and BBB permeability must be affected indirectly, most likely by mediators released from the adjacent glutamate-responsive cells.","['Animals', 'Brain Ischemia', 'Calcium', 'Capillaries', 'Cattle', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cerebrovascular Circulation', 'Colforsin', 'Cyclic AMP', 'Cycloleucine', 'Endothelin-1', 'Endothelium, Vascular', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate', 'Kainic Acid', 'Mice', 'N-Methylaspartate', 'Neurons', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'RNA, Messenger', 'Rats', 'Receptors, AMPA', 'Receptors, Glutamate', 'Receptors, Kainic Acid', 'Receptors, Metabotropic Glutamate', 'Receptors, N-Methyl-D-Aspartate', 'Second Messenger Systems', 'alpha-Amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic Acid']",9538905,"[['B01.050'], ['C10.228.140.300.150', 'C14.907.253.092'], ['D01.268.552.100', 'D01.552.539.288', 'D23.119.100'], ['A07.015.461.165'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.500.380.271'], ['A11.251'], ['G09.330.100.159'], ['D02.455.849.291.300'], ['D03.633.100.759.646.138.395', 'D13.695.462.200', 'D13.695.667.138.395', 'D13.695.827.068.395'], ['D02.455.426.392.368.450.350', 'D12.125.072.170'], ['D12.644.276.400.225', 'D12.776.467.400.225', 'D23.529.400.225'], ['A07.015.700.500', 'A10.272.491.355'], ['G05.297'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D02.033.800.519.400.350', 'D09.853.519.400.350', 'D09.894.480.350'], ['D03.383.773.400'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500'], ['D12.125.067.500.400', 'D12.125.119.170.400'], ['A08.675', 'A11.671'], ['E05.393.620.500'], ['D13.444.735.544'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700'], ['D12.776.157.530.400.400.500.100', 'D12.776.543.550.450.500.200.100', 'D12.776.543.585.400.500.200.100', 'D12.776.543.750.720.200.450.400.100'], ['D12.776.543.750.720.200.450'], ['D12.776.157.530.400.400.500.200', 'D12.776.543.550.450.500.200.200', 'D12.776.543.585.400.500.200.200', 'D12.776.543.750.720.200.450.400.200'], ['D12.776.543.750.695.450', 'D12.776.543.750.720.200.450.500'], ['D12.776.157.530.400.400.500.500', 'D12.776.543.550.450.500.200.500', 'D12.776.543.585.400.500.200.500', 'D12.776.543.750.720.200.450.400.500'], ['G02.111.820.800', 'G04.835.800'], ['D03.383.129.385.025']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
[Changes in nurse-midwifery practices in Taiwan].,"Nurse-midwifery professionals play an important role for pregnant women in the healthcare system, providing assistance to both expectant women and their newborn children. In Taiwan, midwifery professionals have contributed significantly to women and infant health. Before 1960s, nurse-midwives were the main nursing caregivers for women and babies. However, this changed for a variety of reasons. In the past, the education of much of the population was limited to vocational high schools and five-year junior colleges. In 1999, midwifery education was extended to the college and graduate school levels. Nurse-midwives hold that pregnancy, childbirth, and breastfeeding represent natural processes. Traditionally speaking, women have been in control of pregnancy and childbirth. Healthcare offered includes the following items: proper medical consultation, collaboration with obstetricians on case management, referral of cases to other institutions, participation in women's health promotion and illness prevention. In Taiwan, in an attempt to realize the great potential of the nurse-midwifery profession, we hope to emphasize the three stages of teaching, examination, and employment. In the future, we hope that nurse-midwifery policies will be directed to promote the image of nurse-midwives and confirm their status as healthcare professionals.","['Education, Nursing', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Midwifery', 'Taiwan']",19319807,"[['I02.358.462'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['H02.478.676.416'], ['Z01.252.474.872', 'Z01.639.850']]","['Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]', 'Geographicals [Z]']",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1
High autophagy in the naked mole rat may play a significant role in maintaining good health.,"BACKGROUND/AIMS: The maximum lifespan of the naked mole rat is over 28.3 years, which exceeds that of any other rodent species, suggesting that age-related changes in its body composition and functionality are either attenuated or delayed in this extraordinarily long-lived species. However, the mechanisms underlying the aging process in this species are poorly understood. In this study, we investigated whether long-lived naked mole rats display more autophagic activity than short-lived mice.METHODS: Hepatic stellate cells isolated from naked mole rats were treated with 50 nM rapamycin or 20 mM 3-methyladenine (3-MA) for 12 or 24 h. Expression of the autophagy marker proteins LC3-II and beclin 1 was measured with western blotting and immunohistochemistry. The induction of apoptosis was analyzed by flow cytometry.RESULTS: Our results demonstrate that one-day-old naked mole rats have higher levels of autophagy than one-day-old short-lived C57BL/6 mice, and that both adult naked mole rats (eight months old) and adult C57BL/6 mice (eight weeks old) have high basal levels of autophagy, which may be an important mechanism inhibiting aging and reducing the risk of age-related diseases.CONCLUSION: Here, we report that autophagy facilitated the survival of hepatic stellate cells from the naked mole rat, and that treatment with 3-MA or rapamycin increased the ratio of apoptotic cells to normal hepatic stellate cells.","['Adenine', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins', 'Autophagy', 'Hepatic Stellate Cells', 'Immunosuppressive Agents', 'Longevity', 'Mice', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins', 'Mole Rats', 'Sirolimus']",24525846,"[['D03.633.100.759.138'], ['B01.050'], ['D12.644.360.075', 'D12.776.476.075'], ['G04.011'], ['A11.561'], ['D27.505.696.477.656'], ['G07.345.124.519', 'G07.540'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500'], ['D12.776.220.600.450', 'D12.776.631.560'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.600'], ['D02.540.505.760']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Dietary changes reported by a random sample of elderly people.,"A random sub-sample of 153 elderly people was followed up 18 months after a large-scale random dietary survey of adults aged 65 years and over residing in Adelaide, South Australia. The follow-up questionnaire examined self-reported dietary and weight change over the 18 month period since the original study. The same semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire as used in the initial survey was also repeated. Challenging the common stereotype of rigidity and resistance to change in elderly people, a high degree of dietary change was reported since the original study (67% of men and 68% of women reported a change in diet), particularly among the 65-69 year age group (78%). The most commonly reported changes were largely in accord with dietary guidelines. Commonly reported changes included less frequent intake of red meat, eggs, fried and fatty foods and more frequent intake of vegetables, chicken and fish, as well as changes towards use of polyunsaturated margarine, no longer eating the fat on meat and no longer presoaking vegetables in water before cooking. Of concern was a change in some subjects to a less frequent consumption of milk or other dairy products.","['Aged', 'Diet Surveys', 'Feeding Behavior', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'South Australia']",1296986,"[['M01.060.116.100'], ['E05.318.308.980.485.350', 'N05.715.360.300.800.469.300', 'N06.850.505.616.300', 'N06.850.520.308.980.469.350'], ['F01.145.113.547', 'F01.145.407', 'G07.203.650.353'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['Z01.639.100.968', 'Z01.678.100.373.968']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Geographicals [Z]']",0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1
Long non-coding RNA MEG3 inhibits chondrogenic differentiation of synovium-derived mesenchymal stem cells by epigenetically inhibiting TRIB2 via methyltransferase EZH2.,"Osteoarthritis (OA) is a highly prevalent skeletal disease. Mesenchymal stem cell-derived cartilage tissue engineering is a clinical method used for OA treatment. Investigations on the molecular regulatory mechanisms of the chondrogenic differentiation of synovium-derived mesenchymal stem cells(SMSCs) will help promote its clinical applications. In this study, bioinformatics analysis from three different databases indicated that the long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) MEG3 may regulate the chondrogenic differentiation of SMSCs by targeting TRIB2. We then performed assays and found that both knockdown of MEG3 or overexpression of TRIB2 can stimulate the chondrogenic differentiation of SMSCs and increase Col2A1 and aggrecan expression. Knockdown of MEG3 can induce the expression of TRIB2; conversely, overexpression of MEG3 can inhibit the expression of TRIB2. Futhermore, knockdown of the TRIB2 can rescue the MEG3 silencing-mediated promotion of chondrogenic differentiation. Moreover, RNA immunoprecipitation(RIP) and RNA pull-down assays demonstrated that MEG3 can interact with EZH2, thus recruiting it to induce H3K27me3, which promotes the methylation of TRIB2 by binding with the promoter of TRIB2 in SMSCs. Additionally, EZH2 silencing significantly rescued the MEG3 overexpression-mediated inhibition of TRIB2 expression and chondrogenic differentiation of SMSCs. Taken together, these data indicated that MEG3 regulates chondrogenic differentiation by inhibiting TRIB2 expression through EZH2-mediated H3K27me3.","['Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chondrogenesis', 'Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 Protein', 'Humans', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells', 'RNA, Long Noncoding', 'Synovial Membrane']",31376524,"[['D08.811.913.696.620.682.700.125', 'D12.644.360.100', 'D12.776.476.100'], ['G04.152'], ['A11.251'], ['G07.345.500.325.377.625.180', 'G11.427.578.180'], ['D05.500.781.750.250', 'D08.811.913.555.500.800.200.500.500.500', 'D12.776.660.235.600.200.250', 'D12.776.664.235.800.200.250', 'D12.776.930.780.890.200.250'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['A11.329.830.500', 'A11.872.590.500'], ['D13.444.735.790.375'], ['A02.835.583.443.800']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Organisms [B]']",1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Schizophrenic disorder and social functioning.,Social functioning is assessed according to 84 questioned subjects with schizophrenic disorder and their 84 key figures. Schizophrenic subjects showed significant dysfunction in all reviewed areas of behaviour and social roles. Key figures of all schizophrenic subjects most often showed a positive attitude in regard to the future of the schizophrenic members of their family. In relation to social functioning of the schizophrenic subject and the attitude of family key figures there is a statistically significant difference as well as a relationship. Results of assessment confirmed the impact of family life on social functioning of the schizophrenic patient and stresses the importance of active family support in rehabilitation programs.,"['Adult', 'Caregivers', 'Cost of Illness', 'Family Relations', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Personality Assessment', 'Psychiatric Status Rating Scales', 'Schizophrenia', 'Schizophrenic Psychology', 'Social Adjustment', 'Social Behavior Disorders', 'Social Support']",9682929,"[['M01.060.116'], ['M01.085', 'M01.526.485.200', 'N02.360.200'], ['N03.219.151.165', 'N05.715.360.300.800.438.375.182', 'N06.850.520.308.980.438.475.046'], ['F01.829.263.370', 'I01.880.853.150.439'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['F04.513'], ['F04.711.513.653'], ['F03.700.750'], ['F04.824'], ['F01.145.813.621'], ['I01.880.735.784'], ['I01.880.853.500.600']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Organisms [B]']",0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0
Outcomes and prognostic factors for aggressive posterior retinopathy of prematurity following initial treatment with intravitreal ranibizumab.,"BACKGROUND: This study sought to identify factors associated with retinal detachment and retreatment of aggressive posterior retinopathy of prematurity (APROP) initially treated with intravitreal ranibizumab (IVR) injection as well as the efficacy of IVR treatment.METHODS: This was a retrospective study. A total of 83 preterm infants (160 eyes) diagnosed with APROP who were primarily treated with IVR were included. The 160 eyes were divided into two groups based on the anatomic outcomes. Group A included 35 eyes that developed retinal detachment, and Group B included 125 eyes without retinal detachment. The following patient factors were retrospectively reviewed: gender, gestational age (GA), birth weight (BW), postmenstrual age (PMA) at first treatment, iris neovascularizations, retinal hemorrhage, neutrophil and lymphocyte counts before the first intravitreal injection, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), anatomical outcomes, additional treatment and follow-up time. Three dummy variables were created as dependent variables based on the methods of retreatment. The possible risk factors for APROP were evaluated, and statistical analyses included univariate and multivariate logistic regression.RESULTS: A total of 160 eyes from 83 preterm infants (56 males and 27 females) underwent initial IVR treatment with a follow-up time of 17.17 ± 10.54 months. Thirty-five of the 160 (21.9%) eyes progressed to retinal detachment, and 82 of the 125 (65.6%) non-retinal detachment eyes needed retreatment, with favorable anatomical outcomes. The disease improved approximately 1.5 ± 1.2 weeks after the first IVR treatment. The mean recurrence period of APROP was approximately 7.5 ± 6.9 weeks after the first IVR treatment. Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed postmenstrual age (P < 0.001) and neutrophil count (P = 0.009) as the most significant factors for retinal detachment in APROP. Retinal hemorrhage (P = 0.007) and BW (P = 0.04) were most significantly associated with APROP recurrence and retreatment.CONCLUSIONS: IVR injection is an effective treatment for APROP. In this study, older postmenstrual age and low neutrophil count were identified as risk factors for retinal detachment in APROP. In addition, retinal hemorrhage and low BW were significantly associated with recurrence and retreatment in non-retinal detachment APROP. Thus, patients with a lower BW, older postmenstrual age, low neutrophil count and retinal hemorrhage should be reexamined in a timely and more frequent manner.","['Angiogenesis Inhibitors', 'China', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Infant, Premature', 'Intravitreal Injections', 'Male', 'Prognosis', 'Ranibizumab', 'Retina', 'Retinal Detachment', 'Retinopathy of Prematurity', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A', 'Visual Acuity']",29940900,"[['D27.505.696.377.077.099', 'D27.505.696.377.450.100', 'D27.505.954.248.025'], ['Z01.252.474.164'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.249', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.350', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.350'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E05.318.308.985.525.375', 'N01.224.935.597.500', 'N06.850.505.400.975.525.375', 'N06.850.520.308.985.525.375'], ['M01.060.703.520'], ['M01.060.703.520.520'], ['E02.319.267.530.475.500'], ['E01.789'], ['D12.776.124.486.485.114.224.060.868', 'D12.776.124.790.651.114.224.060.868', 'D12.776.377.715.548.114.224.200.868'], ['A09.371.729'], ['C11.768.648'], ['C11.768.836', 'C16.614.521.731'], ['E05.318.372.500.500.500', 'E05.318.372.500.750.750', 'N05.715.360.330.500.500.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.825', 'N06.850.520.450.500.500.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.825'], ['E05.318.740.600.800.725', 'N05.715.350.200.700', 'N05.715.360.750.625.700.700', 'N06.850.490.625.750', 'N06.850.520.830.600.800.725'], ['E05.318.308.980.438.475.456.500', 'N05.715.360.300.800.438.375.364.500', 'N06.850.520.308.980.438.475.364.500'], ['G01.910.857'], ['E01.789.800', 'N04.761.559.590.800', 'N05.715.360.575.575.800'], ['D12.644.276.100.800.200', 'D12.776.467.100.800.200', 'D23.529.100.800.200'], ['E01.370.380.850.950', 'F02.463.593.932.901', 'G14.940']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]']",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1
Skeletal uptake of diphosphonate. Method for prediction of post-menopausal osteoporosis.,"24-h whole-body retention (WBR) of diphosphonate (a sensitive indicator of skeletal metabolism) was measured in 37 oophorectomised women. 14 women had been prescribed oestrogen supplements and 3 of these had defaulted from therapy. For the study group there was a significant correlation between WBR and both the rate of bone loss as measured by photonabsorptiometry (r = 0.7, p ? 0.001) and urinary hydroxyproline (r = 0.53, p < 0.001). The oestrogen-treated group had significantly lower values for WBR and rate of bone loss than the untreated group (p < 0.01, p < 0.01 respectively) indicating suppressed skeletal metabolism. However, the highest values were found in those who had defaulted from oestrogen therapy suggesting a rebound period of accelerated skeletal metabolism and bone loss. There was a significant negative correlation between WBR and oestrogen dosage (r = 0.75, p < 0.02) suggesting that it may be possible to adjust the dosage for optimal skeletal metabolic activity. WBR of diphosphonate provides a simple and sensitive measure of skeletal metabolism which correlates well with conventional measurements of bone loss. WBR may be useful in the screening and identification of women who have increased bone turnover just after the menopause and who may subsequently be at risk of osteoporosis developing.","['Aged', 'Bone and Bones', 'Castration', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Diphosphonates', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Estrogens', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Menopause', 'Middle Aged', 'Osteoporosis']",6106785,"[['M01.060.116.100'], ['A02.835.232', 'A10.165.265'], ['E04.270.282', 'E04.950.165'], ['E05.318.372.250.250', 'N05.715.360.330.250.250', 'N06.850.520.450.250.250'], ['D02.705.429.500'], ['E05.318.370.300', 'E05.581.500.300', 'N05.715.360.325.320', 'N06.850.520.445.300'], ['D27.505.696.399.472.277'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['G08.686.157.500', 'G08.686.841.249.500'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['C05.116.198.579', 'C18.452.104.579']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Diseases [C]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0

Comprehensive mapping of human body skin hydration: A pilot study.,"BACKGROUND: Previous studies analyzed a series of representative anatomical regions in the human body; however, there is a wide structural and cellular variability in the constitution of the skin. Our objective was to perform a comprehensive assessment of human skin hydration throughout the largest possible area.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Hydration was registered by Corneometer® CM825 probe in 23 anatomical regions of five healthy men. Each zone was analyzed by 2-cm segments in the supine, prone, and lateral positions. A total of 7863 measurements were registered.RESULTS: Differences in the degree of hydration among the prone, supine, and lateral regions were observed. The chest and back showed a pattern of increased hydration toward the neck area. Higher levels of hydration were evidenced in the proximal areas and in the regions near the elbow and knee. The regions of greater mechanical wear and with greater exposure to the sun exhibited a lower degree of hydration.CONCLUSION: The human skin exhibited hydration patterns influenced by anatomical function and the degree of sun exposure. Detailed information of the hydration patterns could serve as reference for the design of topical products, as an indicator of their effectiveness, and for the monitoring of skin pathologies.","['Adult', 'Body Surface Potential Mapping', 'Body Water', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Human Body', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Organism Hydration Status', 'Pilot Projects', 'Skin', 'Skin Diseases', 'Skin Physiological Phenomena']",30302824,"[['M01.060.116'], ['E01.370.370.380.240.850.100', 'E01.370.405.240.850.100'], ['A12.207.200'], ['E05.318.372.500.875', 'N05.715.360.330.500.875', 'N06.850.520.450.500.875'], ['I01.076.201.450.560', 'K01.093.378'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['G07.670'], ['E05.318.372.750', 'E05.337.737', 'N05.715.360.330.720', 'N06.850.520.450.720'], ['A17.815'], ['C17.800'], ['G13.750']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Humanities [K]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Diseases [C]']",1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0

Thus, it is concluded that the nuclear crease is a fairly constant and characteristic feature of PTC in FNA biopsies and can be used as a valuable diagnostic criterion.","['Biopsy, Needle', 'Carcinoma, Papillary', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cytodiagnosis', 'Humans', 'Thyroid Neoplasms']",3428064,"[['E01.370.225.500.384.100.119', 'E01.370.225.998.054.119', 'E01.370.388.100.100', 'E04.074.119', 'E04.665.100', 'E05.200.500.384.100.119', 'E05.200.998.054.119', 'E05.242.384.100.119'], ['C04.557.470.200.360', 'C04.557.470.700.360'], ['A11.284.430.106', 'A11.284.430.214.190.875.117'], ['E01.370.225.500.384', 'E05.200.500.384', 'E05.242.384'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C04.588.322.894', 'C04.588.443.915', 'C19.344.894', 'C19.874.788']]","['Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Organisms [B]']",1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Hemorrhagic preconditioning improves vascular reactivity after hemorrhagic shock by activation of PKCá and PKCå via the adenosine A1 receptor in rats.,"BACKGROUND: Our previous study demonstrated that protein kinase C (PKC) has an important protective role on vascular reactivity and calcium sensitivity after shock. Here, we investigated if hemorrhagic preconditioning could lessen shock-induced vascular hyporeactivity by activating PKC.METHODS: Using hemorrhagic-shocked rats, the protective effects of different extents of hemorrhagic preconditioning on vascular reactivity and calcium sensitivity; the roles of PKCá, PKCå, and adenosine in this process; as well as hemorrhagic preconditioning-induced systemic effects were observed.RESULTS: Hemorrhage preconditioning (particularly hemorrhage involving 5% of the total estimated blood volume implemented 30 minutes before shock) significantly improved vascular reactivity and calcium sensitivity after shock. Hemorrhage preconditioning enhanced the translocation of PKCá and PKCå from the cytoplasm to the membrane and increased the blood concentration of adenosine after shock. Antagonists of PKCá, PKCå, and the adenosine A1 receptor abolished the hemorrhagic preconditioning-induced protective effects on vascular reactivity and calcium sensitivity. The adenosine A1 receptor antagonist eliminated hemorrhagic preconditioning-induced translocation of PKCá and PKCå. Hemorrhagic preconditioning could significantly increase survival, improve hemodynamic parameters, and increase the blood flow and mitochondrial respiratory function of the liver and kidney in hemorrhagic-shock rats.CONCLUSION: Hemorrhagic preconditioning could induce the protection of vascular reactivity and calcium sensitivity after hemorrhagic shock through the adenosine-adenosine A1 receptor-PKCá and PKCå signaling pathway and could bring further beneficial systemic effects in hemorrhagic-shock rats.","['Adenosine', 'Adenosine A1 Receptor Antagonists', 'Animals', 'Blood Vessels', 'Calcium', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Female', 'Ischemic Preconditioning', 'Male', 'Protein Kinase C-alpha', 'Protein Kinase C-epsilon', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar', 'Receptor, Adenosine A1', 'Shock, Hemorrhagic']",23609277,"[['D03.633.100.759.590.138', 'D13.570.583.138', 'D13.570.800.096'], ['D27.505.519.625.725.400.100.100', 'D27.505.696.577.725.400.100.100'], ['B01.050'], ['A07.015'], ['D01.268.552.100', 'D01.552.539.288', 'D23.119.100'], ['G02.111.263', 'G03.328'], ['E02.592', 'E05.516'], ['D08.811.913.696.620.682.700.725.100'], ['D08.811.913.696.620.682.700.725.750'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700.900'], ['D12.776.543.750.695.700.700.100', 'D12.776.543.750.720.700.700.100'], ['C23.550.414.980', 'C23.550.835.650']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Diseases [C]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Adhesive capsulitis of the hip: three case reports.,"PURPOSE: To describe the diagnosis and treatment of adhesive capsulitis of the hip (ACH).METHOD: A literature review and consideration of three case reports.DISCUSSION: Adhesive capsulitis of the hip is a supposedly rare but probably underestimated condition which predominantly affects middle-aged women. Clinical assessment reveals a painful limitation of joint mobility. The diagnosis is confirmed by arthrography, where the crucial factor is a joint capacity below 12ml. Osteoarthritis and complex regional pain syndrome type 1 are the two main differential diagnoses. Whether the treatment is pharmacological, physical or surgical depends on the aetiology of the condition. Physiotherapy is essential for limiting residual deficits and functional impairments.CONCLUSION: Adhesive capsulitis of the hip is probably more common than suggested by the limited medical literature. The condition is frequently idiopathic but can be secondary to another joint pathology. The first-line treatment consists of sustained-release corticosteroid intra-articular injections and physical therapy. Arthroscopy and manipulation under anaesthesia may be useful in cases of ACH which are refractory to treatment.","['Adult', 'Aged', 'Bursitis', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Hip Joint', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Radiography']",18502531,"[['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['C05.550.251'], ['E01.171'], ['A02.835.583.411'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E01.370.350.700']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Organisms [B]']",1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
Evidence for the early prenatal development of cortical cholinergic afferents from the nucleus of Meynert in the human foetus.,"A combined histochemical and biochemical approach has shown that the cholinergic system in the nucleus of Meynert region of the substantia innominata is well defined both histochemically and neurochemically within the first 3 months of gestation in the human foetus. Thus, at between 12 and 22 weeks of development the most intense acetylcholinesterase (AChE) histochemical reactivity was observed in the neuropil, cell bodies and processes in the nucleus of Meynert. AChE-stained fibres were observed which coursed from the nucleus of Meynert towards the cortical mantle and within the mantle AChE-stained fibres were also present. Micropunch samples from within the nucleus of Meynert contained higher levels of choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) activity than any other area examined including the striatum, while in the cortical mantle the level of ChAT activity was comparable to that found in the adult cerebral cortex. These observations suggest that the cholinergic innervation from the nucleus of Meynert--considered to be the major source of cholinergic afferents in the adult cerebral cortex--may play a key role in the early development of the human neocortex.","['Acetylcholinesterase', 'Afferent Pathways', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Cerebral Cortex', 'Choline O-Acetyltransferase', 'Cholinergic Fibers', 'Histocytochemistry', 'Humans', 'Substantia Innominata']",4080261,"[['D08.811.277.352.100.170.176'], ['A08.612.220'], ['A08.186.211.200.885.287.249'], ['A08.186.211.200.885.287.500'], ['D08.811.913.050.134.180'], ['A08.675.127.500', 'A08.675.542.234', 'A11.671.188.500', 'A11.671.501.234'], ['E01.370.225.500.607', 'E01.370.225.750.551', 'E05.200.500.607', 'E05.200.750.551', 'H01.158.100.656.234', 'H01.158.201.344', 'H01.181.122.573'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['A08.186.211.180.820', 'A08.186.211.200.885.287.249.880']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]', 'Organisms [B]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
Short double-stranded ribonucleic acid as inhibitor of gene expression by the interference mechanism.,"The rapid development of the small interfering ribonucleic acid (siRNA)-induced inhibition of the gene expression at the RNA level offers to research groups a new strategy for the understanding of gene functions. The siRNA approach is close to antisense oligonucleotide technology and takes advantage of the progress of chemically synthesized oligoribonucleotides. This approach for the mammalian cells was described by Elbashir et al. at the beginning of 2001, and in this chapter we describe methods for the design of siRNA molecules, solutions for efficiently transfecting cells, and methods for analyzing the inhibition of targeted genes. Methods for in vivo approach are also proposed.","['Base Sequence', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'RNA, Double-Stranded', 'RNA, Small Interfering']",15333918,"[['G02.111.570.080', 'G05.360.080', 'L01.453.245.667.080'], ['G05.308'], ['D13.444.735.490', 'G02.111.570.820.486.775', 'G05.360.580.775'], ['D13.150.650.700', 'D13.444.735.150.700', 'D13.444.735.790.552.875']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]']",0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
"Cadmium, lead and zinc concentrations in water, sediment and oyster (Crassostrea virginica) of San Andres Lagoon, Mexico.","The spatial distribution of cadmium, lead and zinc concentrations in water, sediment and oysters from San Andres Lagoon was evaluated. Significantly higher cadmium (0.33 mg L(-1)) and lead (0.70 mg L(-1)) concentrations in water were observed in front of the mouth of Tigre river, whereas, zinc concentration (5.0 mg L(-1)) was significantly higher in the south part of the lagoon. Similarly, lead and zinc values in sediment (1.01 and 9.29 ìg g(-1), respectively) and oyster tissue (0.86 and 3.19 ìg g(-1), respectively) were significantly higher in the south part of the lagoon. Levels of cadmium and lead in oyster tissue were positively related to those found in sediment. However, concerning zinc no evident relationship was found. Such differences in regression analyses may be explained by differential bioaccumulation of xenobiotic (cadmium, lead) and essential (zinc) metals.","['Animals', 'Cadmium', 'Crassostrea', 'Environmental Monitoring', 'Geologic Sediments', 'Lead', 'Mexico', 'Seawater', 'Water Pollutants, Chemical', 'Zinc']",21336861,"[['B01.050'], ['D01.268.556.137', 'D01.268.956.061', 'D01.552.544.137'], ['B01.050.500.644.080.643.150'], ['N06.850.460.350.080', 'N06.850.780.375'], ['G01.311.330', 'G16.500.320'], ['D01.268.556.435', 'D01.552.544.435'], ['Z01.107.567.589'], ['G16.500.275.725.500'], ['D27.888.284.903.655'], ['D01.268.556.940', 'D01.268.956.906', 'D01.552.544.940']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Geographicals [Z]']",0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1
The genetic polymorphisms of cathepsin S were associated with metabolic disorders in a Chinese Han population.,"Cathepsin S (CTSS) played an important role in the etiology of cardiovascular disease and metabolic syndrome. Few studies had been reported on the association between the polymorphisms of CTSS and metabolic disorders in Asian population. Therefore we explored the association between the polymorphisms of CTSS and metabolic disorders in a Chinese Han population. The subjects were a Chinese Han cohort with 1160 participants, and the genotyping was performed with PCR-RFLP. Polymorphism rs16827671 was associated with BMI and serum total cholesterol (P=0.001; P=0.02, respectively). Subjects with CT genotype of rs16827671 had a higher risk of hypercholesterolemia (OR=1.64, 95% CI: 1.15-2.33, P=0.006) compared with TT genotype. Subjects with AG genotype of rs11576175 had lower risks of hypertriglyceridemia and borderline hypercholesterolemia (OR=0.52, 95% CI: 0.36-0.73, P=0.0001; OR=0.52, 95% CI: 0.35-0.77, P=0.001, respectively) compared with GG genotype. Compared with the haplotype TG, haplotype TA had a lower risk of hypertriglyceridemia and a higher risk of borderline hypercholesterolemia (OR=0.62, 95% CI: 0.44-0.88, P=0.002; OR=1.59, 95% CI: 1.10-2.31, P=0.008, respectively), and haplotype CA had a lower risk of hypercholesterolemia (OR=0.35, 95% CI: 0.18-0.68, P=0.002). In conclusion, we found that the genetic polymorphisms of CTSS were associated with metabolic disorders in a Chinese Han population, which would enrich the knowledge on genetic mechanisms of the pathogenesis of metabolic disorders.","['Adult', 'Aged', 'Asian Continental Ancestry Group', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cathepsins', 'China', 'Female', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genetic Association Studies', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Middle Aged', 'Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Risk Factors', 'Young Adult']",23747398,"[['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['M01.686.508.200'], ['E05.318.372.500.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.500'], ['D08.811.277.656.224'], ['Z01.252.474.164'], ['G05.330'], ['E05.393.385'], ['G05.380'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C18.452'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['G05.365.795'], ['G05.365.795.598'], ['E05.318.740.600.800.725', 'N05.715.350.200.700', 'N05.715.360.750.625.700.700', 'N06.850.490.625.750', 'N06.850.520.830.600.800.725'], ['M01.060.116.815']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1
"Infant feeding, HIV transmission and mortality at 18 months: the need for appropriate choices by mothers and prioritization within programmes.","OBJECTIVES: To determine the late HIV transmission and survival risks associated with early infant feeding practices.DESIGN: A nonrandomized intervention cohort.METHODS: HIV-infected pregnant women were supported in their infant feeding choices. Infant feeding data were obtained weekly; blood samples from infants were taken monthly to diagnose HIV infection. Eighteen-month mortality and HIV transmission risk were assessed according to infant feeding practices at 6 months.RESULTS: One thousand one hundred and ninety-three live-born infants were included. Overall 18-month probabilities of death (95% confidence interval) were 0.04 (0.03-0.06) and 0.53 (0.46-0.60) for HIV-uninfected and HIV-infected children, respectively. The eighteen-month probability of survival was not statistically significantly different for HIV-uninfected infants breastfed or replacement fed from birth. In univariate analysis of infant feeding practices, the probability of HIV-free survival beyond the first 6 months of life in children alive at 6 months was 0.98 (0.89-1.00) amongst infants replacement fed from birth, 0.96 (0.90-0.98; P = 0.25) and 0.91 (0.87-0.94; P = 0.03) in those breastfed for less or more than 6 months, respectively. In multivariable analyses, maternal unemployment and low antenatal CD4 cell count were independently associated with more than three-fold increased risk of infant HIV infection or death.CONCLUSION: Breastfeeding and replacement feeding of HIV-uninfected infants were associated with similar mortality rates at 18 months. However, these findings were amongst mothers and infants who received excellent support to first make, and then practice, appropriate infant feeding choices. For programmes to achieve similar results, the quality of counselling and identification of mothers with low CD4 cell count need to be the targets of improvement strategies.","['AIDS Serodiagnosis', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Anti-HIV Agents', 'Breast Feeding', 'CD4 Lymphocyte Count', 'Choice Behavior', 'Developing Countries', 'Female', 'HIV Infections', 'HIV-1', 'Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice', 'Health Priorities', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant Mortality', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Nevirapine', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Complications, Infectious', 'Survival Analysis', 'Young Adult']",18981775,"[['E01.370.225.812.735.060', 'E01.370.225.875.408.500', 'E05.200.812.735.060', 'E05.200.875.408.500', 'E05.478.594.760.060'], ['M01.060.057'], ['M01.060.116'], ['D27.505.954.122.388.077.088'], ['F01.145.407.199', 'G07.203.650.195', 'G07.203.650.220.500.500', 'G07.203.650.353.199'], ['E01.370.225.500.195.107.595.500.150', 'E01.370.225.625.107.595.500.150', 'E05.200.500.195.107.595.500.150', 'E05.200.625.107.595.500.150', 'E05.242.195.107.595.500.150', 'G04.140.107.595.500.150', 'G09.188.105.595.500.150'], ['F02.463.785.373.346'], ['I01.615.500.300'], ['C01.221.250.875', 'C01.221.812.640.400', 'C01.778.640.400', 'C01.925.782.815.616.400', 'C01.925.813.400', 'C20.673.480'], ['B04.820.650.589.650.350.400'], ['F01.100.150.500', 'N05.300.150.410'], ['N03.349.330', 'N05.300.400'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.703'], ['E05.318.308.985.550.475', 'N01.224.935.698.489', 'N06.850.505.400.975.550.475', 'N06.850.520.308.985.550.475'], ['M01.060.703.520'], ['D03.383.725.506'], ['G08.686.784.769'], ['C01.674', 'C13.703.700'], ['E05.318.740.998', 'N05.715.360.750.795', 'N06.850.520.830.998'], ['M01.060.116.815']]","['Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Health Care [N]']",0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0
Gonadal hormone regulation of glial fibrillary acidic protein immunoreactivity and glial ultrastructure in the rat neuroendocrine hypothalamus.,"The influence of gonadal steroids on the ultrastructure of glial cells and on the immunoreactivity for the specific astrocytic marker glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) has been assessed in the neuroendocrine hypothalamus. The following parameters were analyzed in the arcuate nucleus of adult female rats: the number and the surface density of cells immunoreactive for GFAP, the number of glial profiles showing bundles of glial filaments, the size of the bundles of glial filaments, and the proportion of neuronal perikaryal membrane apposed by glial processes. These parameters were studied during the different phases of the estrous cycle, after ovariectomy, and after the administration of estradiol or progesterone to ovariectomized rats. No significant differences were detected in the number of GFAP-immunoreactive cells among the different experimental groups. The surface density of GFAP-immunoreactive material, the number of glial profiles in the neuropil, and the proportion of neuronal perikaryal membrane covered by glia were increased in the afternoon of proestrus and in the morning of estrus compared with other phases of the estrous cycle or to ovariectomized rats and showed a rapid (5 h) and reversible increase in ovariectomized rats injected with 17 beta estradiol, with a maximal effect by 24 h after the administration of the hormone. In contrast, the size of the bundles of glial filaments was decreased in the afternoon of proestrus, in the morning of estrus, and by the administration of estradiol to ovariectomized rats. The parameters studied were not affected by the administration of progesterone. However, progesterone (300 micrograms/rat) blocked the effects of 17 beta estradiol (1, 10, and 300 micrograms). The results suggest that glial cells may be actively involved in the modulation of neuroendocrine events by the hypothalamus.","['Animals', 'Arcuate Nucleus of Hypothalamus', 'Estradiol', 'Estrus', 'Female', 'Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein', 'Gonadotropins, Pituitary', 'Hypothalamus', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Neuroglia', 'Neurosecretory Systems', 'Ovariectomy', 'Progesterone', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar', 'Tissue Fixation']",8300192,"[['B01.050'], ['A08.186.211.180.497.352.081', 'A08.186.211.200.317.357.352.081'], ['D04.210.500.365.415.248', 'D06.472.334.851.437.500'], ['G08.686.195.500'], ['D05.750.078.593.400', 'D12.776.220.475.400'], ['D06.472.699.322.576', 'D06.472.699.631.525.343', 'D12.644.548.691.525.343'], ['A08.186.211.180.497', 'A08.186.211.200.317.357'], ['E01.370.225.500.607.512', 'E01.370.225.750.551.512', 'E05.200.500.607.512', 'E05.200.750.551.512', 'E05.478.583', 'H01.158.100.656.234.512', 'H01.158.201.344.512', 'H01.158.201.486.512', 'H01.181.122.573.512', 'H01.181.122.605.512'], ['E01.370.350.515.402', 'E05.595.402'], ['A08.637', 'A11.650'], ['A06.688', 'A08.713'], ['E04.270.282.685', 'E04.950.165.685', 'E04.950.300.680'], ['D04.210.500.745.745.654.829', 'D06.472.334.734.623', 'D06.472.334.851.687.750'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700.900'], ['E01.370.225.500.620.760.720', 'E01.370.225.750.600.760.720', 'E05.200.500.620.760.720', 'E05.200.750.600.760.720']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
First FDA approval of dual anti-HER2 regimen: pertuzumab in combination with trastuzumab and docetaxel for HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer.,"On June 8, 2012, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved pertuzumab (Perjeta, Genentech) for use in combination with trastuzumab (Herceptin, Genentech) and docetaxel for the treatment of patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC) who have not received prior anti-HER2 therapy or chemotherapy for metastatic disease. Approval was based on the results of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted in 808 patients with HER2-positive MBC. Patients were randomized (1:1) to receive pertuzumab (n = 402) or placebo (n = 406) in combination with trastuzumab and docetaxel. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) and a key secondary endpoint was overall survival (OS). A statistically significant improvement in PFS (difference in medians of 6.1 months) was observed in patients receiving pertuzumab [HR, 0.62; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.51-0.75; P < 0.0001]. A planned interim analysis suggested an improvement in OS (HR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.47-0.88; P = 0.0053) but the HR and P value did not cross the stopping boundary. Common adverse reactions (>30%) observed in patients on the pertuzumab arm included diarrhea, alopecia, neutropenia, nausea, fatigue, rash, and peripheral neuropathy. No additive cardiac toxicity was observed. Significant manufacturing issues were identified during the review. On the basis of substantial evidence of efficacy for pertuzumab in MBC and the compelling public health need, FDA did not delay availability to patients pending final resolution of all manufacturing concerns. Therefore, FDA approved pertuzumab but limited its approval to lots not affected by manufacturing problems. The applicant agreed to multiple manufacturing and testing postmarketing commitments under third-party oversight to resolve manufacturing issues.","['Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols', 'Docetaxel', 'Drug Approval', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Receptor, ErbB-2', 'Taxoids', 'Trastuzumab', 'Treatment Outcome', 'United States', 'United States Food and Drug Administration']",23801166,"[['D12.776.124.486.485.114.224.060', 'D12.776.124.790.651.114.224.060', 'D12.776.377.715.548.114.224.200'], ['E02.183.750.500', 'E02.319.077.500', 'E02.319.310.037'], ['D02.455.426.392.368.242.888.389', 'D02.455.849.291.850.389'], ['E05.290.250', 'E05.337.300', 'I01.880.604.605.250.250'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C04.697.650', 'C23.550.727.650'], ['E05.318.372.250.250.365.500', 'N05.715.360.330.250.250.365.500', 'N06.850.520.450.250.250.365.500'], ['D08.811.913.696.620.682.725.400.009.400', 'D12.776.543.750.630.009.400', 'D12.776.543.750.750.400.074.400', 'D12.776.624.664.700.642', 'D23.050.301.500.600.700', 'D23.050.705.552.600.550', 'D23.101.140.642'], ['D02.455.426.392.368.242.888', 'D02.455.849.291.850'], ['D12.776.124.486.485.114.224.060.875', 'D12.776.124.790.651.114.224.060.875', 'D12.776.377.715.548.114.224.200.875'], ['E01.789.800', 'N04.761.559.590.800', 'N05.715.360.575.575.800'], ['Z01.107.567.875'], ['I01.409.418.750.600.650.760', 'N03.540.348.500.500.600.650.760']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Geographicals [Z]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1
Can Abdominal Computed Tomography Imaging Help Accurately Identify a Dedifferentiated Component in a Well-Differentiated Liposarcoma?,"PURPOSE: To assess the ability of computed tomography (CT) to differentiate an atypical lipomatous tumor/well-differentiated liposarcoma (WDLPS) from a WDLPS with a dedifferentiated component (DDLPS) within it.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-nine untreated patients with abdominal atypical lipomatous tumors/well-differentiated liposarcomas who had undergone contrast-enhanced CT were identified using an institutional database. Three radiologists who were blinded to the pathology findings evaluated all the images independently to determine whether a dedifferentiated component was present within the WDLPS. The CT images were evaluated for fat content (?25% or >25%); presence of ground-glass density, enhancing and/or necrotic nodules; presence of a capsule surrounding the mass; septations; and presence and pattern of calcifications. A multivariate logistic regression model with generalized estimating equations was used to correlate imaging features with pathology findings. Kappa statistics were calculated to assess agreement between the three radiologists.RESULTS: On the basis of pathological findings, 12 patients had been diagnosed with DDLPS within a WDLPS and 37 had been diagnosed with WDLPS. The presence of an enhancing or a centrally necrotic nodule within the atypical lipomatous tumor was associated with dedifferentiated liposarcoma (P = 0.02 and P = 0.0003, respectively). The three readers showed almost perfect agreement in overall diagnosis (ê r = 0.83; 95% confidence interval, 0.67-0.99).CONCLUSIONS: An enhancing or centrally necrotic nodule may be indicative of a dedifferentiated component in well-differentiated liposarcoma. Ground-glass density nodules may not be indicative of dedifferentiation.","['Abdominal Neoplasms', 'Adult', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Liposarcoma', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Observer Variation', 'Radiography, Abdominal', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed']",27454788,"[['C04.588.033'], ['M01.060.116'], ['E01.171'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C04.557.450.550.420', 'C04.557.450.795.465'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['E01.354.753', 'N02.421.450.600', 'N05.715.350.150.675', 'N06.850.490.500.250'], ['E01.370.350.700.715'], ['E05.318.370.725', 'E05.337.851', 'N05.715.360.325.685', 'N06.850.520.445.725'], ['E05.318.370.800', 'E05.318.740.872', 'G17.800', 'N05.715.360.325.700', 'N05.715.360.750.725', 'N06.850.520.445.800', 'N06.850.520.830.872'], ['E01.370.350.350.810', 'E01.370.350.600.350.700.810', 'E01.370.350.700.700.810', 'E01.370.350.700.810.810', 'E01.370.350.825.810.810']]","['Diseases [C]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
Temporally distinct phosphorylations differentiate Tau-dependent learning deficits and premature mortality in Drosophila.,"Abnormally phosphorylated Tau protein, the major component of neurofibrillary tangles, is critical in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease and related Tauopathies. We used Drosophila to examine the role of key disease-associated phosphorylation sites on Tau-mediated neurotoxicity. We present evidence that the late-appearing phosphorylation on Ser(238) rather than hyperphosphorylation per se is essential for Tau toxicity underlying premature mortality in adult flies. This site is also occupied at the time of neurodegeneration onset in a mouse Tauopathy model and in damaged brain areas of confirmed Tauopathy patients, suggesting a similar critical role on Tau toxicity in humans. In contrast, occupation of Ser(262) is necessary for Tau-dependent learning deficits in adult Drosophila. Significantly, occupation of Ser(262) precedes and is required for Ser(238) phosphorylation, and these temporally distinct phosphorylations likely reflect conformational changes. Because sequential occupation of Ser(262) and Ser(238) is required for the progression from Tau-mediated learning deficits to premature mortality in Drosophila, they may also play similar roles in the escalating symptom severity in Tauopathy patients, congruent with their presence in damaged regions of their brains.","['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Alzheimer Disease', 'Amino Acid Motifs', 'Animals', 'Brain', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Learning', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Middle Aged', 'Mortality, Premature', 'Neurofibrillary Tangles', 'Phosphorylation', 'tau Proteins']",25524708,"[['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['M01.060.116.100.080'], ['C10.228.140.380.100', 'C10.574.945.249', 'F03.615.400.100'], ['G02.111.570.820.709.275.500', 'G02.111.570.820.709.600.500'], ['B01.050'], ['A08.186.211'], ['C22.232', 'E05.598.500', 'E05.599.395.080'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['F02.463.425', 'F02.784.629.529'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['E05.318.308.985.550.550', 'N01.224.935.698.700', 'N06.850.505.400.975.550.550', 'N06.850.520.308.985.550.550'], ['A08.675.609.520', 'A11.284.430.214.190.750.640.520', 'A11.671.573.520'], ['G02.111.665', 'G02.607.780', 'G03.796'], ['D12.776.220.600.450.510', 'D12.776.631.560.510']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]']",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
Infarct fogging on immediate postinterventional CT-a not infrequent occurrence.,"PURPOSE: A pseudo-normalization of infarcted brain parenchyma, similar to the ""fogging effect"" which usually occurs after 2-3 weeks, can be observed on CT performed immediately after endovascular stroke treatment (EST). Goal of this study was to analyze the incidence of this phenomenon and its evolution on follow-up imaging.METHODS: One hundred fifty-two patients in our database of 949 patients, who were treated for acute stroke between January 2010 and January 2015, fulfilled the inclusion criteria of (a) EST for an acute stroke in the anterior circulation, (b) an ASPECT-score < 10 on pre-interventional CT, and (c) postinterventional CT imaging within 4.5 h after the procedure. Two independent reviewers analyzed imaging data of these patients.RESULTS: Transformation of brain areas from hypoattenuated on pre-interventional CT to isodense on postinterventional CT was seen in 37 patients in a total of 49 ASPECTS areas (Cohen's kappa 0.819; p < 0.001). In 17 patients, the previously hypoattenuated brain areas became isodense, but appeared swollen. In 20 patients (13%), the previously hypodense brain area could not be distinguished from normal brain parenchyma. On follow-up imaging, all isodense brain areas showed signs of infarction.CONCLUSION: Pseudo-normalization of infarct hypoattenuation on postinterventional CT is not infrequent. It is most likely caused by contrast leakage in infarcted parenchyma and does not represent salvage of ischemic brain parenchyma.","['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Brain Infarction', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Contrast Media', 'Endovascular Procedures', 'Extravasation of Diagnostic and Therapeutic Materials', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Registries', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed', 'Treatment Outcome']",28776270,"[['M01.060.057'], ['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['M01.060.116.100.080'], ['C10.228.140.300.150.477', 'C10.228.140.300.775.200', 'C14.907.253.092.477', 'C14.907.253.855.200', 'C23.550.513.355.250', 'C23.550.717.489.250'], ['M01.060.406'], ['M01.060.406.448'], ['D27.505.259.500', 'D27.720.259'], ['E04.100.814.529', 'E04.502.382'], ['C23.550.340', 'C26.371'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['E05.318.308.970', 'N04.452.859.819', 'N05.715.360.300.715.700', 'N06.850.520.308.970'], ['E05.318.372.500.500.500', 'E05.318.372.500.750.750', 'N05.715.360.330.500.500.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.825', 'N06.850.520.450.500.500.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.825'], ['E01.370.350.350.810', 'E01.370.350.600.350.700.810', 'E01.370.350.700.700.810', 'E01.370.350.700.810.810', 'E01.370.350.825.810.810'], ['E01.789.800', 'N04.761.559.590.800', 'N05.715.360.575.575.800']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Health Care [N]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
"Long-term efficacy of a 0.07% cetylpyridinium chloride mouth rinse in relation to plaque and gingivitis: a 6-month randomized, vehicle-controlled clinical trial.","OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness of 0.07% cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC) mouth rinse for reduction of gingival inflammation and inhibition of plaque compared to a vehicle control (VC) mouth rinse over a 6-month period.MATERIALS & METHODS: Participants (n = 62) used their randomly assigned product as adjunct to toothbrushing. Bleeding, plaque and staining scores were assessed at baseline, 3 and 6 months. Plaque and saliva samples were taken at each assessment monitoring possible shifts in the composition of the microbiota.RESULTS: A significant difference (P = 0.002) in favour of the CPC mouth rinse, with respect to plaque scores, was found. Bleeding scores at 6 months were not significantly different (P = 0.089). However, when correcting for baseline values, a tendency towards a significant difference in bleeding scores at end trail was observed in favour of the CPC mouth rinse (P = 0.061). Regarding staining at 3 and 6 months, a small but significant difference (8.6% and 10.4%, respectively) (P < 0.0001) was observed with lower scores for the VC group. There was a significant reduction in total anaerobic count in the CPC group at 6 months (P < 0.05). The ratio of aerobes/anaerobes was markedly increased at 3 months, especially in the CPC group. No further differences were observed between groups at 6 months.CONCLUSIONS: The use of 0.07% CPC mouth rinse was significantly more effective in reducing plaque scores than the vehicle control. Bleeding scores were not different at 6 months. The test product was well accepted and did not cause any serious clinical side effects or negatively affected the microbiota.","['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Anti-Infective Agents, Local', 'Bacteria, Aerobic', 'Bacteria, Anaerobic', 'Bacterial Load', 'Cetylpyridinium', 'Dental Plaque', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Gingival Hemorrhage', 'Gingivitis', 'Humans', 'Lactobacillus', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Male', 'Mouthwashes', 'Pharmaceutical Vehicles', 'Placebos', 'Saliva', 'Streptococcus', 'Tooth Discoloration', 'Toothbrushing', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",25040299,"[['M01.060.057'], ['M01.060.116'], ['D27.505.954.122.187'], ['B03.120'], ['B03.130'], ['E01.370.225.875.150.115', 'E01.370.225.875.220.115', 'E05.200.875.150.115', 'E05.200.875.220.115', 'G06.099.100'], ['D03.383.725.762.232'], ['C07.793.208.377'], ['E05.318.370.300', 'E05.581.500.300', 'N05.715.360.325.320', 'N06.850.520.445.300'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.249', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.350', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.350'], ['C07.465.625.446', 'C07.465.714.258.250', 'C23.550.414.922.500'], ['C01.408', 'C07.465.714.258.480'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['B03.353.750.450.475', 'B03.510.460.400.410.475.475', 'B03.510.550.450.475'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.500'], ['D25.583', 'D27.720.102.583', 'D27.720.269.583', 'J01.637.051.583'], ['D26.650.700', 'D27.720.744.770', 'E02.319.300.754'], ['D26.660', 'E02.785'], ['A12.200.666'], ['B03.353.750.737.872', 'B03.510.400.800.872', 'B03.510.550.737.872'], ['C07.793.735'], ['E06.761.726.794'], ['E01.789.800', 'N04.761.559.590.800', 'N05.715.360.575.575.800'], ['M01.060.116.815']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0
[Regulation of the biomass and activity of soil microorganisms by microfauna].,"Microcosm experiments showed that the microbial biomass and the respiration activity in soil were regulated by nematodes. Depending on nematode number and plant residue composition, the trophic activity of nematodes can either stimulate or inhibit microbial growth and respiration as compared to soil containing no nematodes. The stimulating effect was observed when nitrogen-free (starch) or low-nitrogen (wheat straw, C:N = 87) organic substrates were applied. Inhibition occurred when a substrate rich in nitrogen (alfalfa meal, C:N = 28) was decomposed and the nematode population exceeded the naturally occurring level. A conceptual model was developed to describe trophic regulation by microfauna (nematodes) of the microbial productivity and respiration activity and decomposition of not readily decomposable organic matter in soil. The stimulating and inhibiting influence of microfauna on soil microorganisms was not a linear function of the rate of microbial consumption by nematodes. These effects are largely associated with the induced change in the physiological state of microorganisms rather than with the mobilization of biogenic elements from the decomposed microbial biomass.","['Animals', 'Bacteria', 'Ecosystem', 'Models, Biological', 'Nematoda', 'Soil Microbiology']",11315679,"[['B01.050'], ['B03'], ['G16.500.275.157', 'N06.230.124'], ['E05.599.395'], ['B01.050.500.500.294'], ['H01.158.273.540.274.555', 'N06.850.425.300']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]']",0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0
Detecting early glaucomatous field defects with the size I stimulus and Statpac.,"The influence of stimulus size and normal database on the detection of visual field defects in automated static threshold perimetry (Humphrey Field Analyzer) was investigated in 82 eyes having a diagnosis of normal, glaucoma suspect, or early glaucoma. Using a mathematically derived 'normal' database, which assumes constantly decreasing threshold sensitivities with increasing eccentricity, the size I stimulus showed significantly greater sensitivity than the size III stimulus for detecting small, shallow scotomata in the central visual field. The use of Statpac, which contains an empirically derived, age-related normal database, increased the sensitivity significantly over that of the size III stimulus (with its mathematical model), and to a degree similar to that of the size I stimulus. The results obtained with the size I stimulus were reproducible and independent of the patient's age. This study suggests a potential role for the size I stimulus in evaluating eyes having or at risk of developing early glaucomatous field loss.","['Adult', 'Glaucoma', 'Humans', 'Mathematics', 'Middle Aged', 'Models, Biological', 'Sensory Thresholds', 'Visual Field Tests', 'Visual Fields']",2354137,"[['M01.060.116'], ['C11.525.381'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['H01.548'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['E05.599.395'], ['F02.463.593.710'], ['E01.370.380.850.962'], ['F02.463.593.932.934', 'G14.950']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0
Lactic acid production in mouse calvaria in vitro with and without parathyroid hormone stimulation: lack of acetazolamide effects.,"The effect of acetazolamide on lactic acid production in mouse calvaria explants was examined in an attempt to explain in vivo inhibition of Ca mobilization from bone by sulfonamide inhibitors of carbonic anhydrase. Lactic acid production was evaluated in 8-10-week-old CD-1 mouse calvaria over a time period consistent with acetazolamide inhibition of both PTH-stimulated and nonstimulated Ca mobilization from bone in vivo. Labeled lactate, derived from [3,4-14C]glucose, and total lactate production were determined at 2-h intervals for up to 8 h. Simultaneous assessment of 14CO2 production and [14C]pyruvate levels established that acetazolamide produced no other related metabolic effects and that the drug did not block PTH stimulation of CO2 production. Acetazolamide (4.5 X 10(-4) M) was found to have no effect on labeled or total lactate production in mouse calvaria for up to 8 h of treatment. In addition, acetazolamide did not block PTH (10(-7) M) stimulation of lactate production. However, Cl 13,850 (10(-4) M), a structural analog of acetazolamide devoid of inhibitory activity on carbonic anhydrase or Ca mobilization from bone, was shown to significantly reduce lactate production from mouse calvaria. These results, therefore, suggest that acetazolamide does not inhibit Ca mobilization from bone through inhibition of lactic acid production and fail to support a mechanistic relationship between lactic acid production and Ca mobilization from bone.","['Acetazolamide', 'Animals', 'Bone and Bones', 'Calcium', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Lactates', 'Lactic Acid', 'Mice', 'Parathyroid Hormone', 'Sulfonamides']",3593606,"[['D02.886.675.867.060', 'D03.383.129.708.867.060'], ['B01.050'], ['A02.835.232', 'A10.165.265'], ['D01.268.552.100', 'D01.552.539.288', 'D23.119.100'], ['E05.481'], ['D02.241.511.459'], ['D02.241.511.459.450'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500'], ['D06.472.699.590', 'D12.644.548.587'], ['D02.065.884', 'D02.886.590.700']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

RNA interference screen identifies Usp18 as a regulator of epidermal growth factor receptor synthesis.,"Elevated expression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) contributes to the progression of many types of cancer. Therefore, we developed a high-throughput screen to identify proteins that regulate the levels of EGFR in squamous cell carcinoma. Knocking down various ubiquitination-related genes with small interfering RNAs led to the identification of several novel genes involved in this process. One of these genes, Usp18, is a member of the ubiquitin-specific protease family. We found that knockdown of Usp18 in several cell lines reduced expression levels of EGFR by 50-80%, whereas the levels of other receptor tyrosine kinases remained unchanged. Overexpression of Usp18 elevated EGFR levels in a manner requiring the catalytic cysteine of Usp18. Analysis of metabolically radiolabeled cells showed that the rate of EGFR protein synthesis was reduced up to fourfold in the absence of Usp18. Interestingly, this dramatic reduction occurred despite no change in the levels of EGFR mRNA. This suggests that depletion of Usp18 inhibited EGFR mRNA translation. In fact, this inhibition required the presence of native 5' and 3' untranslated region sequences on EGFR mRNA. Together, our data provide evidence for the novel mechanism of EGFR regulation at the translational step of receptor synthesis.","['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'Down-Regulation', 'Endopeptidases', 'ErbB Receptors', 'Gene Deletion', 'Genes, Reporter', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Messenger', 'Up-Regulation']",19158387,"[['B01.050'], ['A11.251.210'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.199.120.126.110'], ['G02.111.240', 'G05.308.200', 'G07.690.773.937'], ['D08.811.277.656.300'], ['D08.811.913.696.620.682.725.400.009', 'D12.776.543.750.630.009', 'D12.776.543.750.750.400.074'], ['G05.365.590.762.320', 'G05.558.800.320'], ['G05.360.340.024.340.435'], ['G05.308.203.374.790'], ['D13.444.735.544'], ['G02.111.905', 'G05.308.850', 'G07.690.773.998']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]']",1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Neuropsychological features in post-stroke cognitive impairment with no dementia patients with different Traditional Chinese Medicine syndromes.,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate neuropsychological features of post-stroke cognitive impairment with no dementia (PSCIND) patients with different Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) syndromes.METHODS: We recruited 50 patients with PSCIND between April 2012 and March 2013. Patients were divided into different groups according to TCM classifications. Patients were assessed using neuropsychological tests, including cognitive screening (mini-mental state examination), memory testing (auditory verbal learning test), executive/attention [shape trails test, stroop color-word test (SCWT), reading the mind in the eyes test, the digit ordering test-A (DOT-A), and symbol digit modalities test], language (action naming test, Boston naming test, famous face test, similarity test, and verbal fluency test), and visuospatial functioning [complex figure test (CFT)].RESULTS: We found no significant differences between patients with and without a diagnosis of turbid phlegm blocking the upper orifices on neuropsychological test performance. Patients diagnosed with upper hyperactivity of liver Yang syndrome scored significantly lower on the SCWT-C executive test and the CFT-delayed recall memory test. Patients with excess syndrome scored significantly lower on the SCWT-C executive test, and significantly higher on the DOT-A executive test.CONCLUSION: Neuropsychological characteristics differ between PSCIND patients with different TCM classifications.","['Aged', 'Cognitive Dysfunction', 'Drugs, Chinese Herbal', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Medicine, Chinese Traditional', 'Middle Aged', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'Prospective Studies', 'Stroke']",32186029,"[['M01.060.116.100'], ['F03.615.250.700'], ['D20.215.784.500.350', 'D26.335'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E02.190.488.585.520', 'I01.076.201.450.654.558.520'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['F04.711.513'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.625', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.650', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.650'], ['C10.228.140.300.775', 'C14.907.253.855']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Diseases [C]']",0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0
Sexual differentiation of mammalian frontal cortex.,"The pattern of distribution of the progesterone binding sites was examined in selected nuclei of the brain of male and female rat. In female rats the frontal cortex resulted to be the region with the highest concentration of 3H R5020 binding sites. However, in male rats the same region showed very little progestin binding activity. When female rats were androgenized via neonatal exposure to testosterone, the progestin binding activity of the frontal cortex became similar to that we observed in male rats. The present investigation indicates that sexual differentiation of the rat brain may include also brain regions not clearly involved in sex related functions like the frontal cortex.","['Animals', 'Brain', 'Castration', 'Female', 'Frontal Lobe', 'Male', 'Promegestone', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred Strains', 'Receptors, Progesterone', 'Sex Characteristics', 'Tissue Distribution', 'Tritium']",3561146,"[['B01.050'], ['A08.186.211'], ['E04.270.282', 'E04.950.165'], ['A08.186.211.200.885.287.500.270'], ['D04.210.500.668.651.443.680'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700'], ['B01.050.050.199.520.760', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700.400'], ['D12.776.826.750.765'], ['G08.686.815'], ['G03.787.917', 'G07.690.725.949'], ['D01.268.406.875', 'D01.362.340.875', 'D01.496.749.925']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Isoproterenol exacerbates hyperglycemia and modulates chromium distribution in mice fed with a high fat diet.,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Isoproterenol (ISO), a nonselective â-adrenoceptor agonist for treating bradycardia and asthma, has been proposed to raise blood glucose level. Little is known regarding the relationship between ISO treatment, the induced chromium (Cr) redistribution, and changes in glucose metabolism. We aimed to characterize the effects of a single dose of ISO on glucose homeostasis and Cr level changes in an obesity mouse model.METHODS: Mice (C57BL6/j strain) were first fed for a continuous period of 12 weeks with either a high fat diet (HFD), to develop an obesity animal model, or a standard diet (SD), to develop a lean animal model as controls. These groups were each separated into two subgroups to receive either a single dose of ISO or saline (control). We measured in vivo their metabolic parameters, fasting glucose level, area under the curve (AUC) for glucose level time profile, insulin level time profile, insulin sensitivity index, and chromium distribution.RESULTS: After a single dose of ISO, the SD-fed mice had slightly higher blood glucose levels compared with the SD controls, when the level was measured 30 and 60min after injection. By contrast, the ISO-treated HFD-fed mice had significantly higher blood glucose levels and AUC during the entire 120min following one administration compared with the HFD control group. Additionally, they had a substantially lower HOMA-IR index, whereas insulin levels remained unchanged. The Cr level in their bones and liver was decreased, and loss of Cr through urinary excretion was elevated.CONCLUSION: The results demonstrated that ISO exacerbated hyperglycemic syndrome in the obesity animal model. ISO induced a net negative Cr balance as a result of increased urinary excretion, leading to Cr mobilization that was not desirable to overcome the hyperglycemia.","['Animals', 'Blood Glucose', 'Body Weight', 'Chromium', 'Creatinine', 'Diet, High-Fat', 'Disease Progression', 'Energy Intake', 'Feeding Behavior', 'Hyperglycemia', 'Insulin', 'Insulin Resistance', 'Isoproterenol', 'Kidney', 'Male', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Obese']",28965593,"[['B01.050'], ['D09.947.875.359.448.500'], ['C23.888.144', 'E01.370.600.115.100.160.120', 'E05.041.124.160.750', 'G07.100.100.160.120', 'G07.345.249.314.120'], ['D01.268.556.175', 'D01.268.956.124', 'D01.552.544.175'], ['D03.383.129.308.207'], ['G07.203.650.240.267'], ['C23.550.291.656'], ['G07.203.650.240.340'], ['F01.145.113.547', 'F01.145.407', 'G07.203.650.353'], ['C18.452.394.952'], ['D06.472.699.587.200.500.625', 'D12.644.548.586.200.500.625'], ['C18.452.394.968.500', 'G07.690.773.984.617'], ['D02.033.100.291.439', 'D02.092.063.291.439', 'D02.092.311.649', 'D02.455.426.559.389.657.166.175.649'], ['A05.810.453'], ['B01.050.050.199.520.520.420', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500.400.420'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500.550.530']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Phosphorylation of ribavirin and viramidine by adenosine kinase and cytosolic 5'-nucleotidase II: Implications for ribavirin metabolism in erythrocytes.,"Many nucleoside analog drugs, such as ribavirin and viramidine, are activated or metabolized in vivo through 5'-phosphorylation. In this report, we determined the steady-state kinetic parameters for 5'-monophosphorylation of ribavirin and viramidine by adenosine kinase. The apparent Km for ribavirin is 540 microM, and k(cat) is 1.8 min-1. Its catalytic efficiency of 3.3 x 10(-3) min-1 . microM-1 is 1,200-fold lower than that of adenosine. In contrast to the common belief that ribavirin is exclusively phosphorylated by adenosine kinase, cytosolic 5'-nucleotidase II was found to catalyze ribavirin phosphorylation in vitro. The reaction is optimally stimulated by the physiological concentration of ATP or 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate. In phosphate-buffered saline plus ATP and 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate, the apparent Km for ribavirin is 88 microM, and k(cat) is 4.0 min-1. These findings suggest that cytosolic 5'-nucleotidase II may be involved in ribavirin phosphorylation in vivo. Like ribavirin, viramidine was found to be phosphorylated by either adenosine kinase or cytosolic 5'-nucleotidase II, albeit with a much lower activity. The catalytic efficiency for viramidine phosphorylation is 10- to 330-fold lower than that of ribavirin, suggesting that other nucleoside kinase(s) may be involved in viramidine phosphorylation in vivo. Both ribavirin and viramidine are not phosphorylated by deoxycytidine kinase and uridine-cytidine kinase. The coincidence of presence of high concentrated 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate in erythrocytes suggests that cytosolic 5'-nucleotidase II could play an important role in phosphorylating ribavirin and contribute to anabolism of ribavirin triphosphate in erythrocytes. Elucidation of ribavirin and viramidine phosphorylation mechanism should shed light on their in vivo metabolism, especially the ribavirin-induced hemolytic anemia in erythrocytes.","[""5'-Nucleotidase"", 'Adenosine Kinase', 'Animals', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Cricetinae', 'Cytosol', 'Erythrocytes', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Phosphorylation', 'Ribavirin']",15917509,"[['D08.811.277.352.650.600.600'], ['D08.811.913.696.620.010'], ['B01.050'], ['D27.505.954.122.388'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.075.250'], ['A11.284.430.214.200', 'A11.284.430.429.200', 'A11.284.835.450.200'], ['A11.118.290', 'A11.443.240', 'A15.145.229.334'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['G01.374.661', 'G02.111.490'], ['G02.111.665', 'G02.607.780', 'G03.796'], ['D13.570.800.790']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Trial-to-trial variability and state-dependent modulation of auditory-evoked responses in cortex.,"Recent experimental work has provided evidence that trial-to-trial variability of sensory-evoked responses in cortex can be explained as a linear superposition of random ongoing background activity and a stationary response. While studying single trial variability and state-dependent modulation of evoked responses in auditory cortex of ketamine/xylazine-anesthetized rats, we have observed an apparent violation of this model. Local field potential and unit spike trains were recorded and analyzed during different anesthesia depths-deep, medium, and light-which were defined by the pattern of ongoing cortical activity. Estimation of single trial evoked response was achieved by considering whole waveforms, rather than just one or two peak values from each wave. Principal components analysis was used to quantitatively classify waveforms on the basis of their time courses (i.e., shapes). We found that not only average response but also response variability is modulated by depth of anesthesia. Trial-to-trial variability is highest under medium levels of anesthesia, during which ongoing cortical activity exhibits rhythmic population bursting activity. By triggering the occurrence of stimuli from the spontaneously occurring burst events, we show that the observed variability can be accounted for by the background activity. In particular, the ongoing activity was found to modulate both amplitude and shape (including latency) of evoked local field potentials and evoked unit activity in a manner not predicted by linear superposition of background activity and a stereotyped evoked response. This breakdown of the linear model is likely attributable to rapid transitions between different levels of thalamocortical excitability (e.g., spike-wave discharges), although brain ""state"" is relatively fixed.","['Acoustic Stimulation', 'Anesthesia', 'Anesthetics, Dissociative', 'Animals', 'Auditory Cortex', 'Evoked Potentials, Auditory', 'Female', 'Ketamine', 'Rats', 'Reaction Time', 'Xylazine']",10575042,"[['E02.037', 'E02.190.888.030', 'E05.723.136'], ['E03.155'], ['D27.505.696.277.100.035.075.035', 'D27.505.954.427.210.100.035.075.035'], ['B01.050'], ['A08.186.211.200.885.287.500.814.249', 'A08.186.211.200.885.287.500.863.297'], ['G07.265.216.500.370', 'G07.888.250', 'G11.561.200.500.370'], ['D02.455.426.392.368.367.652'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700'], ['E05.796.817', 'F02.830.650', 'F04.669.817', 'G11.561.677'], ['D02.886.665.985', 'D03.383.855.985']]","['Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]']",1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Neurological complications of celiac disease and autoimmune mechanisms: preliminary data of a prospective study in adult patients.,"Antibodies to gangliosides and Purkinje cells have been reported in patients with celiac disease (CD) with neuropathy and ataxia, respectively. Whether these antibodies are pathogenic is not clear. The response of neurological symptoms and antibody titers to a gluten-free diet is still controversial. The objective of our study was to assess whether neurological manifestations in CD patients correlate with antibody titers and a gluten-free diet.Thirty-five CD patients (9 males, 26 females, mean age 37.1 +/- 12.6 yrs) were followed prospectively. At initial evaluation, 23 were on a gluten-free diet, 12 were not. At recruitment and during follow-up, patients underwent neurological and electrophysiological evaluation. IgG, IgM, and IgA anti-ganglioside antibodies were assayed by ELISA; anti-neuronal antibodies were assessed by immunohistochemistry and Western blot. Four patients, all males, had electrophysiological evidence of neuropathy; three had been on a gluten-free diet for several months, and one was newly diagnosed. One had reduced tendon reflexes; another complained of distal paresthesias. With regard to anti-ganglioside antibodies, three patients had a moderate increase in antibodies without symptoms or signs of neuropathy. No patients had ataxia or cerebellar dysfunction, although in four patients reactivity to neuronal antigens was found. In 17 patients, an electrophysiological follow-up (mean duration of follow-up, 9 months) showed no changes. In conclusion, the preliminary results of this prospective study indicate that neuropathy, usually subclinical, may accompany CD. Antibody titers do not seem to correlate with neurological symptoms/signs or diet. Ongoing follow-up will help confirm these data and clarify the role, if any, of antibodies in neurological involvement in CD.","['Adult', 'Autoimmunity', 'Celiac Disease', 'Female', 'Gangliosides', 'Glutens', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nervous System Diseases', 'Neurons', 'Prospective Studies']",16126954,"[['M01.060.116'], ['G12.450.192'], ['C06.405.469.637.250', 'C18.452.603.250'], ['D09.400.410.420.025.475', 'D10.390.470.025.475', 'D10.570.877.360.025.475'], ['D12.776.765.433.500.500', 'D12.776.765.725.500.500'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['C10'], ['A08.675', 'A11.671'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.625', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.650', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.650']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
"Factors influencing adoption of facility-assisted delivery - a qualitative study of women and other stakeholders in a Maasai community in Ngorongoro District, Tanzania.","BACKGROUND: Tanzania's One Plan II health sector program aims to increase facility deliveries from 50 to 80% from 2015 to 2020. Success is uneven among certain Maasai pastoralist women in Northern Tanzania who robustly prefer home births to facility births even after completing 4+ ANC visits. Ebiotishu Oondomonok Ongera (EbOO) is a program in Nainokanoka ward to promote facility births through a care-group model using trained traditional birth attendants (TBAs) as facilitators. Results to date are promising but show a consistent gap between women completing ANC and those going to a facility for delivery. A qualitative study was conducted to understand psychosocial preferences, agency for decision-making, and access barriers that influence where a woman in the ward will deliver.METHODS: In-depth interviews, focus group discussions and key-informant interviews were conducted with 24 pregnant and/or parous women, 24 TBAs, 3 nurse midwives at 3 health facilities, and 24 married men, living in Nainokanoka ward. Interviews and discussions were transcribed, translated, and analyzed thematically using a grounded theory approach.RESULTS: Most women interviewed expressed preference for a home birth with a TBA and even those who expressed agency and preference for a facility birth usually had their last delivery at home attributed to unexpected labor. TBAs are engaged by husbands and play a significant influential role in deciding place of delivery. TBAs report support for facility deliveries but in practice use them as a last resort, and a significant trust gap was documented based on a bad experience at a facility where women in labor were turned away.CONCLUSIONS: EbOO project data and study results show a slow but steady change in norms around delivery preference in Nainokanoka ward. Gaps between expressed intention and practice, especially around 'unexpected labor' present opportunities to accelerate this process by promoting birth plans and perhaps constructing a maternity waiting house in the ward. Rebuilding trust between facility midwives, TBAs, and the community on the availability of health facility services, and increased sensitivity to women's cultural preferences, could also close the gap between the number of women who are currently using facilities for ANC and those returning for delivery.","['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Decision Making', 'Female', 'Focus Groups', 'Health Facilities', 'Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice', 'Home Childbirth', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Midwifery', 'Patient Preference', 'Pregnancy', 'Prenatal Care', 'Qualitative Research', 'Rural Population', 'Spouses', 'Tanzania', 'Young Adult']",32050919,"[['M01.060.057'], ['M01.060.116'], ['F02.463.785.373'], ['E05.318.308.112', 'N05.715.360.300.269', 'N06.850.520.308.112'], ['N02.278'], ['F01.100.150.500', 'N05.300.150.410'], ['G08.686.784.769.490.062.500'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['H02.478.676.416'], ['F01.100.150.750.625.500', 'F01.145.488.887.625.500', 'N04.452.822.700.500', 'N05.300.150.800.625.500'], ['G08.686.784.769'], ['E02.760.786', 'N02.421.143.620.704', 'N02.421.585.786'], ['H01.770.644.241.850'], ['N01.600.725'], ['F01.829.263.500.660', 'I01.880.853.150.500.670', 'M01.816'], ['Z01.058.290.120.840'], ['M01.060.116.815']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Geographicals [Z]']",0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1
Anaerobic degradation of the benzene nucleus by a facultatively anaerobic microorganism.,"A bacterium was isolated by elective culture with p-hydroxybenzoate as substrate and nitrate as electron acceptor. It grew either aerobically or anaerobically, by nitrate respiration, on a range of aromatic compounds. The organism was identified as a pseudomonad and was given the trivial name Pseudomonas PN-1. Benzoate and p-hydroxybenzoate were metabolized aerobically via protocatechuate, followed by meta cleavage catalyzed by protocatechuic acid-4,5-oxygenase, to yield alpha-hydroxy-gamma-carboxymuconic semialdehyde. Pseudomonas PN-1 grew rapidly on p-hydroxybenzoate under strictly anaerobic conditions, provided nitrate was present, even though protocatechuic acid-4,5-oxygenase was repressed. Suspensions of cells grown anaerobically on p-hydroxybenzoate oxidized benzoate with nitrate and produced 4 to 5 mumoles of CO(2) per mumole of benzoate added; these cells did not oxidize benzoate aerobically. The patterns of the oxidation of aromatic substrates with oxygen or nitrate by cells grown aerobically or anaerobically on different aromatic compounds indicated that benzoate rather than protocatechuate was a key intermediate in the early stages of anaerobic metabolism. It was concluded that the pathway for the anaerobic breakdown of the aromatic ring is different and quite distinct from the aerobic pathway. Mechanisms for the anaerobic degradation of the benzene nucleus by Pseudomonas PN-1 are discussed.","['Benzene', 'Benzoates', 'Cell-Free System', 'Centrifugation', 'Chemical Phenomena', 'Chemistry', 'Culture Media', 'Manometry', 'Nitrates', 'Oxygen', 'Oxygenases', 'Pseudomonas', 'Spectrophotometry', 'Vibration']",5419260,"[['D02.455.426.559.389.023'], ['D02.241.223.100', 'D02.455.426.559.389.127'], ['A11.284.835.168'], ['E05.181'], ['G02'], ['H01.181'], ['D27.720.470.305', 'E07.206'], ['E05.559'], ['D01.248.497.158.606', 'D01.625.525.550', 'D02.583'], ['D01.268.185.550', 'D01.362.670'], ['D08.811.682.690'], ['B03.440.400.425.625.625', 'B03.660.250.580.590'], ['E05.196.712.726', 'E05.196.867.826'], ['G01.374.930']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]', 'Organisms [B]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

[Abdominal polyarteritis nodosa: angiographic features].,"PURPOSE: Polyarteritis nodosa (PAN) is a systemic vasculitis of small and medium size arteries. The purpose of this study is to evaluate imaging findings, especially angiographic features, of 17 patients with abdominal involvement from polyarteritis nodosa.PATIENTS AND METHODS: We reviewed the medical records and imaging findings of 17 patients with PAN involving the abdomen. All patients underwent digital subtraction angiography of the renal or visceral arteries completed by a post-angiographic KUB. Abdominal CT scan was available in three patients. All patients underwent muscle biopsy. A surgical biopsy of the gallbladder was obtained in one patient.RESULTS: Multiple small aneurysms involving small and medium sized arteries were detected at angiography in 12 patients. CT showed a renal subcapsular hematoma in two patients and acute pancreatitis in one patient.CONCLUSION: Involvement of gastrointestinal and renal arteries is frequent in polyarteritis nodosa. The diagnosis of PAN should be considered when multiple small-sized aneurysms are present at angiography even if biopsy is negative.","['Abdomen', 'Abdominal Pain', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Aneurysm', 'Angiography, Digital Subtraction', 'Biopsy', 'Female', 'Fever', 'Humans', 'Hypertension', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Male', 'Mesenteric Artery, Superior', 'Middle Aged', 'Patient Selection', 'Polyarteritis Nodosa', 'Renal Artery', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed', 'Urography', 'Weight Loss']",15205655,"[['A01.923.047'], ['C23.888.592.612.054', 'C23.888.821.030'], ['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['M01.060.116.100.080'], ['C14.907.055'], ['E01.370.350.600.350.700.060', 'E01.370.350.700.060.060', 'E01.370.350.700.700.060', 'E01.370.350.760.060', 'E01.370.370.050.060'], ['E01.370.225.500.384.100', 'E01.370.225.998.054', 'E01.370.388.100', 'E04.074', 'E05.200.500.384.100', 'E05.200.998.054', 'E05.242.384.100'], ['C23.888.119.344'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C14.907.489'], ['C12.777.419', 'C13.351.968.419'], ['A07.015.114.565.755'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['E05.581.500.653', 'N04.590.731'], ['C14.907.940.090.720', 'C14.907.940.897.500', 'C17.800.862.625'], ['A07.015.114.745'], ['E05.318.372.500.500.500', 'E05.318.372.500.750.750', 'N05.715.360.330.500.500.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.825', 'N06.850.520.450.500.500.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.825'], ['E01.370.350.350.810', 'E01.370.350.600.350.700.810', 'E01.370.350.700.700.810', 'E01.370.350.700.810.810', 'E01.370.350.825.810.810'], ['E01.370.350.700.830', 'E01.370.390.830'], ['C23.888.144.243.963', 'G07.345.249.314.120.200.963']]","['Anatomy [A]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
Effect of trabecular bone loss on cortical strain rate during impact in an in vitro model of avian femur.,"BACKGROUND: Osteoporotic hip fractures occur due to loss of cortical and trabecular bone mass and consequent degradation in whole bone strength. The direct cause of most fractures is a fall, and hence, characterizing the mechanical behavior of a whole osteopenic bone under impact is important. However, very little is known about the mechanical interactions between cortical and trabecular bone during impact, and it is specifically unclear to what extent epiphyseal trabecular bone contributes to impact resistance of whole bones. We hypothesized that trabecular bone serves as a structural support to the cortex during impact, and hence, loss of a critical mass of trabecular bone reduces internal constraining of the cortex, and, thereby, decreases the impact tolerance of the whole bone.METHODS: To test this hypothesis, we conducted cortical strain rate measurements in adult chicken's proximal femora subjected to a Charpy impact test, after removing different trabecular bone core masses to simulate different osteopenic severities.RESULTS: We found that removal of core trabecular bone decreased by ~10-fold the cortical strain rate at the side opposite to impact (p < 0.01), i.e. from 359,815 +/- 1799 microm/m per second (mean +/- standard error) for an intact (control) specimen down to 35,997 +/- 180 microm/m per second where 67% of the total trabecular bone mass (approximately 0.7 grams in adult chicken) were removed. After normalizing the strain rate by the initial weight of bone specimens, a sigmoid relation emerged between normalized strain rate and removed mass of trabecular bone, showing very little effect on the cortex strain rate if below 10% of the trabecular mass is removed, but most of the effect was already apparent for less than 30% trabecular bone loss. An analytical model of the experiments supported this behavior.CONCLUSION: We conclude that in our in vitro avian model, loss of over 10% of core trabecular bone substantially altered the deformation response of whole bone to impact, which supports the above hypothesis and indicates that integrity of trabecular bone is critical for resisting impact loads.","['Animals', 'Biomechanical Phenomena', 'Bone and Bones', 'Chickens', 'Femoral Fractures', 'Femur', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Models, Theoretical', 'Osteoporosis', 'Stress, Mechanical', 'Tensile Strength', 'Weight-Bearing']",16854237,"[['B01.050'], ['G01.154.090', 'G01.374.089'], ['A02.835.232', 'A10.165.265'], ['B01.050.150.900.248.350.150', 'B01.050.150.900.248.690.192'], ['C26.404.061', 'C26.558.276'], ['A02.835.232.043.150'], ['E05.481'], ['E05.599'], ['C05.116.198.579', 'C18.452.104.579'], ['G01.374.835'], ['G01.374.850'], ['G01.374.965']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Adaptation of the Body Image Self-Consciousness Scale (BISC-PL) in Polish females.,"OBJECTIVES: This paper presents the Polish version of the Body Image Self-Consciousness Scale (BISC-PL) originally developed by M.W. Wiederman.METHODS: Psychometric properties of the BISC-PLwere examined in a sample of 169 young women aged 18-35 (M = 22.24; SD = 3.61) who self-identified as heterosexual. Measures of sexual self-esteem, heterosexual experience, body satisfaction, self-monitoring and other variables were administered along with the BISC-PL for validity testing.RESULTS: Confirmatory factor analysis (with the use of WLSMV) proved the one-factor structure of the BISC-PL. Goodness of fit indices were: CFI =0.91; TLI =0.90; RMSEA=0.06; SRMR = 0.05. In most cases the tool confirmed its construct and discriminant validity with regard to the aforementioned variables. BISC-PLscores were predictive of sexual self-esteem and self-evaluation of oneself as a sexual partner, beyond effects due to body satisfaction and self-evaluated body attractiveness. The instrument was found to be a reliable (. = 0.96) and valid measure of body image self-consciousness during physical intimacy with a partner in studied women.CONCLUSIONS: Polish version of the BISC can be considered comparable to the original measure. The BISC-PLmay be recommended as a useful tool to complement Polish research and practise. Results are discussed with regard to limitations of the current research and implications for future studies.","['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Body Image', 'Consciousness', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Poland', 'Psychometrics', 'Self Concept', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Young Adult']",31955187,"[['M01.060.057'], ['M01.060.116'], ['F01.752.747.792.110', 'F02.463.593.112'], ['F02.463.188.409', 'F02.830.233'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['F01.145.677'], ['Z01.542.248.679'], ['F04.711.780'], ['F01.752.747.792'], ['E05.318.308.980', 'N05.715.360.300.800', 'N06.850.520.308.980'], ['M01.060.116.815']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]']",0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1
Topography of horizontal cells in the retina of the domestic cat.,Neurofibrillar methods stain a class of horizontal cells in the cat retina which are shown to be identical with the A-type horizontal cell of Golgi-staining. Thus all of the A-type cells of a single retina can be observed. On this basis the changes in density and dendritic field size of A-type horizontal cells with respect to retinal eccentricity were measured. The decrease in density from centre to periphery is balanced by a corresponding increase in size of the dendritic field. Consequently each retinal point--independent of retinal position--is covered by the dendritic fields of three of four A-type horizontal cells. The nuclei and nucleoli of B-type horizontal cells could also be recognized in neurofibrillar-stained material and thus their distribution was determined. The density ratio B-type: A-type is 2.8 +/- 0.4 and does not vary much from the centre to the periphery of the retina. Each retinal point is also covered by four B-type horizontal cells. Thus a single cone can contact a maximum of eight horizontal cells. The rate of density decrease from centre to periphery is closely similar in cones and horizontal cells but greater in ganglion cells.,"['Animals', 'Cats', 'Dendrites', 'Neurofibrils', 'Photoreceptor Cells', 'Retina', 'Staining and Labeling', 'Visual Pathways']",84389,"[['B01.050'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.750.377.750.250.125'], ['A08.675.256', 'A11.284.180.225', 'A11.671.240'], ['A08.675.609', 'A11.284.430.214.190.750.640', 'A11.671.573'], ['A08.675.650.850.625', 'A08.675.650.915.937', 'A08.800.950.937', 'A09.371.729.831.625', 'A11.671.650.850.625', 'A11.671.650.915.937'], ['A09.371.729'], ['E01.370.225.500.620.670', 'E01.370.225.750.600.670', 'E05.200.500.620.670', 'E05.200.750.600.670'], ['A08.612.220.860']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
The effect of montelukast in a model of gouty arthritis induced by sodium monourate crystals.,"Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) are the first line of therapy in acute gouty arthritis. NSAIDs inhibit the cyclooxygenase pathway, but not the lipooxygenase activity and can have many adverse effects and thus have a limited effect on the control of inflammation in this disease. In this work we studied the effect of montelukast on the cellular inflammatory infiltrate in a model of murine arthritis induced by sodium monourate crystals (SMU), using a subcutaneous air cavity (air pouch) in BALB/c mice. Seven groups of BALB/c mice (n = 4) were distributed into five experimental groups and two inflammatory control groups, a positive and a negative one. Previous to SMU exposure, the experimental groups received montelukast (1 and 0.01 mg/Kg/w) and/or indomethacine (2.5 mg/Kg/w), followed by administration of SMU in the air pouch. The total and differential counts of inflammatory cells were analyzed after 2, 6, 12 and 24 hours. Montelukast, significantly reduced the total number of cells (p < 0.05), with a predominant impact on polymorphonuclear over mononuclear cells, especially after 12 hours of the medication. The montelukast/indometacine combination showed an additive effect. Our data show that montelukast has an anti-inflammatory effect in the model of gouty arthritis. Consequently, anti-leukotrienes could represent a new and effective therapy, either isolated or combined with conventional therapy of gouty arthritis.","['Acetates', 'Animals', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal', 'Arthritis, Gouty', 'Cell Migration Assays, Leukocyte', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'Drug Synergism', 'Indomethacin', 'Inflammation', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear', 'Leukotriene Antagonists', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Neutrophils', 'Premedication', 'Quinolines', 'Uric Acid']",21612136,"[['D02.241.081.018', 'D10.251.400.045'], ['B01.050'], ['D27.505.696.663.850.014.040.500', 'D27.505.954.158.030', 'D27.505.954.329.030'], ['C05.550.114.423.410', 'C05.550.354.500.500', 'C05.799.414.410', 'C16.320.565.798.368.410', 'C18.452.648.798.368.410'], ['E01.370.225.500.335.500', 'E01.370.225.812.125.500', 'E05.200.500.335.500', 'E05.200.812.125.500', 'E05.242.335.500', 'E05.478.594.122.500'], ['C22.232', 'E05.598.500', 'E05.599.395.080'], ['G07.690.773.875', 'G07.690.936.500'], ['E05.290.750', 'E05.337.550'], ['G07.690.773.968.477'], ['D03.633.100.473.420'], ['C23.550.470'], ['A11.118.637.555', 'A15.145.229.637.555', 'A15.382.490.555'], ['D06.347.565', 'D27.505.696.399.450.565'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500'], ['B01.050.050.199.520.520.338', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500.400.338'], ['A11.118.637.415.583', 'A11.627.340.583', 'A11.733.689', 'A15.145.229.637.415.583', 'A15.382.490.315.583', 'A15.382.680.689'], ['E02.319.703'], ['D03.633.100.810'], ['D03.132.960.877', 'D03.633.100.759.758.824.877']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Beta-cell function improvement after biliopancreatic diversion in subjects with type 2 diabetes and morbid obesity.,"In subjects with obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), biliopancreatic diversion (BPD) improves glucose stimulated insulin secretion, whereas the effects on other secretion mechanisms are still unknown. Our objective was to evaluate the early effects of BPD on nonglucose-stimulated insulin secretion. In 16 morbid obese subjects (9 with T2DM and 7 with normal fasting glucose (NFG)), we measured insulin secretion after glucose-dependent arginine stimulation test and after intravenous glucose tolerance test (IVGTT) before and 1 month after BPD. After surgery the mean weight lost was 13% in both groups. The acute insulin response during IVGTT was improved in T2DM after BDP (from 55 +/- 10 to 277 +/- 91 pmol/l, P = 0.03). A reduction of insulin response to arginine was observed in NFG, whereas opposite was found in T2DM. In particular, acute insulin response to arginine at basal glucose concentrations (AIR(basal)) was reduced but insulin response at 14 mmol/l of plasma glucose (AIR(14)) was increased. Therefore, after BPD any statistical difference in AIR(14) between NFG and T2DM disappeared (1,032 +/- 123 for NFG and 665 +/- 236 pmol/l for T2DM, P = ns). The same was observed for Slope(AIR), a measure of glucose potentiation, reduced in T2DM before BPD but increased after surgery, when no statistically significant difference resulted compared with NFG (Slope(AIR) after BPD: 78 +/- 11 in NFG and 56 +/- 18 pmol/l in T2DM, P = ns). In conclusion, in obese T2DM subjects 1 month after BPD we observed a great improvement of both glucose- and nonglucose-stimulated insulin secretions. The mechanisms by which BDP improve insulin secretion are still unknown.","['Adult', 'Area Under Curve', 'Biliopancreatic Diversion', 'Blood Glucose', 'Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2', 'Female', 'Glucose Tolerance Test', 'Humans', 'Insulin', 'Insulin Resistance', 'Insulin Secretion', 'Insulin-Secreting Cells', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Obesity, Morbid', 'Statistics, Nonparametric', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']",20186136,"[['M01.060.116'], ['E05.318.740.200', 'G03.787.101', 'G07.690.725.064', 'N06.850.520.830.200'], ['E04.210.120.086', 'E04.210.169'], ['D09.947.875.359.448.500'], ['C18.452.394.750.149', 'C19.246.300'], ['E01.370.225.124.100.355', 'E01.370.374.355', 'E05.200.124.100.355'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D06.472.699.587.200.500.625', 'D12.644.548.586.200.500.625'], ['C18.452.394.968.500', 'G07.690.773.984.617'], ['G03.442', 'G07.475'], ['A03.734.414.131', 'A06.300.414.087', 'A06.390.131', 'A11.382.625.092', 'A11.436.294.092'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['C18.654.726.500.700', 'C23.888.144.699.500.500', 'E01.370.600.115.100.160.120.699.500.500', 'G07.100.100.160.120.699.500.500'], ['E05.318.740.995', 'N05.715.360.750.760', 'N06.850.520.830.995'], ['G01.910.857'], ['E01.789.800', 'N04.761.559.590.800', 'N05.715.360.575.575.800']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
Physical functionality and self-rated health status of adult patients with knee osteoarthritis presenting in a primary care clinic.,"BACKGROUND: Knee osteoarthritis is a chronic medical condition of public health importance in Nigeria which causes disability and impacts daily activities in the sufferers. This study aimed to describe the physical functionality and self-rated health status of adult patients with clinical knee osteoarthritis presenting at the Family Medicine Department, University College Hospital, Ibadan, Nigeria.METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study of 400 respondents. Knee osteoarthritis was diagnosed clinically using the criteria of the American College of Rheumatology. Morbidities, self-rated health status and physical functionality of the respondents were also assessed.RESULTS: Knee osteoarthritis was diagnosed in 46(11.5%) respondents. Respondents with knee osteoarthritis significantly rated their health worse than those without knee osteoarthritis (p <0.0001). Experience of pain, stiffness and performance of daily activities were significantly worse among respondents with knee osteoarthritis. Those who had knee osteoarthritis had significantly higher waist (p <0.0001), hip (p <0.0001) and knee circumferences (p <0.0001) respectively. Logistic regression analysis showed increasing age (OR=1.103; 95% CI=1.022 - 1.191), self-rated health worse than six months ago (OR=12.562; 95% CI=1.178-125.243), experience of stiffness after waking up in the morning (OR=12.758; 95% CI=3.572-45.569), stiffness after sitting/lying down/resting (OR=21.517; 95% CI=2.213-209.220) and waist circumference (OR=1.225;95% CI=1.017-1.477) to be the most significantly associated with knee osteoarthritis.CONCLUSION: Knee osteoarthritis significantly impairs the health and daily activities of adult patients in Ibadan, Nigeria. Healthcare workers need to screen adult patients routinely at first-contact to detect knee osteoarthritis clinically early and manage appropriately.","['Activities of Daily Living', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Ambulatory Care Facilities', 'Body Size', 'Chronic Disease', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Disability Evaluation', 'Female', 'Health Status', 'Humans', 'Knee', 'Knee Joint', 'Logistic Models', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nigeria', 'Odds Ratio', 'Osteoarthritis, Knee', 'Pain', 'Primary Health Care', 'Quality of Life', 'Severity of Illness Index']",25489196,"[['E02.760.169.063.500.067', 'E02.831.067', 'I03.050', 'N02.421.784.110'], ['M01.060.116'], ['N05.715.350.075', 'N06.850.490.250'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['N02.278.035'], ['E01.370.600.115.100.160', 'E05.041.124.160', 'G07.100.100.160', 'G07.345.249.314'], ['C23.550.291.500'], ['E05.318.372.500.875', 'N05.715.360.330.500.875', 'N06.850.520.450.500.875'], ['E01.370.400'], ['I01.240.425', 'N01.224.425', 'N06.850.505.400.425'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['A01.378.610.450'], ['A02.835.583.475'], ['E05.318.740.500.525', 'E05.318.740.600.800.450', 'E05.318.740.750.450', 'E05.599.835.875', 'N05.715.360.750.530.480', 'N05.715.360.750.625.700.450', 'N05.715.360.750.695.470', 'N06.850.520.830.500.525', 'N06.850.520.830.600.800.450', 'N06.850.520.830.750.450'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['Z01.058.290.190.565'], ['E05.318.740.600.600', 'G17.680.500', 'N05.715.360.750.625.590', 'N06.850.520.830.600.600'], ['C05.550.114.606.500', 'C05.799.613.500'], ['C23.888.592.612', 'F02.830.816.444', 'G11.561.790.444'], ['N04.590.233.727'], ['I01.800', 'K01.752.400.750', 'N06.850.505.400.425.837'], ['E05.318.308.980.438.475.456.500', 'N05.715.360.300.800.438.375.364.500', 'N06.850.520.308.980.438.475.364.500']]","['Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Humanities [K]']",1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1
Efferent retinal projections visualized by immunohistochemical detection of the estrogen-related receptor beta in the postnatal and adult mouse brain.,"Recently, a new nuclear receptor subfamily has been identified and referred to as estrogen-related receptors. This new group shares sequence similarity, target genes, co-regulatory proteins, and action sites with the estrogen receptors; however, natural estrogens are not estrogen-related receptors ligands. One of the receptors belonging to this group, estrogen-related receptor beta (ERRbeta), is essential for embryo development and is believed to be involved in estrogen-regulated pathways. In this study, we analyzed the presence of the ERRbeta protein in the mouse brain by means of immunohistochemistry, using a commercial polyclonal antibody against ERRbeta (Sigma, E0156). This study represents the first description dealing with the immunolocalization of ERRbeta in a mammalian brain. Our results revealed numerous ERRbeta immunoreactive fibers in the retinal efferent projections in the brain, which was in agreement with the presence of intense ERRbeta immunoreactivity in the cell bodies and axonal processes of the retinal ganglion cells. In both postnatal and adult brains, ERRbeta immunoreactive fibers were distributed in a pattern which perfectly matched the retinal efferent projections: optic tract, supraoptic commissure, hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus, ventral and dorsal geniculate nuclei, pretectal nuclei, and superior colliculus. Due to reliable, fine, and complete staining of the retinal axons obtained with the anti-ERRbeta antibody (E0156), we suggest that this antibody could be used as a valuable tool for labeling the full retinofugal projections in postnatal or adult brains.","['Aging', 'Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'Antibody Specificity', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Diencephalon', 'Efferent Pathways', 'Estrogen Receptor beta', 'Estrogens', 'Female', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Male', 'Mesencephalon', 'Mice', 'Presynaptic Terminals', 'Retinal Ganglion Cells', 'Visual Pathways']",18472334,"[['G07.345.124'], ['B01.050'], ['B01.050.050.282'], ['G12.100'], ['A08.186.211'], ['E01.370.350.578.875.500', 'E01.370.376.537.625.500', 'E05.629.875.500'], ['A08.186.211.200.317'], ['A08.612.380'], ['D12.776.826.750.350.262'], ['D27.505.696.399.472.277'], ['E01.370.225.500.607.512', 'E01.370.225.750.551.512', 'E05.200.500.607.512', 'E05.200.750.551.512', 'E05.478.583', 'H01.158.100.656.234.512', 'H01.158.201.344.512', 'H01.158.201.486.512', 'H01.181.122.573.512', 'H01.181.122.605.512'], ['A08.186.211.132.659'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500'], ['A08.675.542.145.750', 'A08.850.700', 'A11.284.149.165.420.780.700', 'A11.671.137.750', 'A11.671.501.145.750'], ['A08.675.650.850.875', 'A09.371.729.831.875', 'A11.671.650.850.875'], ['A08.612.220.860']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
Cholinergic compounds. II - Synthesis and biological activity of epi- and allo-desethermuscarines.,"To obtain further clarification of structure-activity relationships of cholinergic substances, which would give better understanding of cholinergic receptors, the carbocyclic analogs of epi-muscarine (I) and allo-muscarine (II) were prepared starting from 6-methyl-3-oxo-2-oxabicyclo[2.2.1]heptane (IV). Pharmacological tests show that these two compounds possess lower muscarinic activity than the carbocyclic analog of muscarine (desethermuscarine), the allo isomer being from 5 to 500 times more active than the epi isomer. Therefore, the activity in the carbocyclic series follows, for these receptors, the same pattern as the oxygenated one. As far as nicotinic activity is concerned. (I) is 2.5 times more active than (II), the effective doses being from 40 to 100 times higher than that of Ach. These results suggest a steric rather than an electronic influence for the ether oxygen, whose principal role seems to be that of contributing to the rigidity of the molecule. For most receptors assayed, an inverse relationship between the potency ratio of the isomers and the sensitivity towards Ach has been observed.","['Animals', 'Anura', 'Carboxylic Acids', 'Cyclization', 'Cycloheptanes', 'Cyclopentanes', 'Female', 'Heart', 'Hydrolysis', 'Ileum', 'Jejunum', 'Lactones', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Male', 'Parasympathomimetics', 'Rats', 'Spectrophotometry, Infrared', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Trachea']",1116599,"[['B01.050'], ['B01.050.150.900.090.180'], ['D02.241'], ['G02.111.180', 'G02.607.133', 'G03.208'], ['D02.455.426.392.368.284'], ['D02.455.426.392.368.450'], ['A07.541'], ['G02.380'], ['A03.556.124.684.249', 'A03.556.249.124'], ['A03.556.124.684.500', 'A03.556.249.750'], ['D02.540'], ['E05.196.867.519'], ['D27.505.696.663.050.675'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700'], ['E05.196.712.726.676', 'E05.196.867.826.676'], ['G02.111.830', 'G07.690.773.997'], ['A04.889']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Aortic root replacement for ascending aortic disease: a 10 year review.,"BACKGROUND: Bentall's procedure and its modifications have been used for over 40 years for the treatment of ascending aortic disease. This study reviewed 10 years of experience with Aortic Root Replacement (ARR) in a major cardiac surgical centre.METHODS: Eighty-nine patients underwent ARR between 1999 and 2009. The records were scrutinised by retrospective chart review.RESULTS: The mean age was 54 years. Seventy-nine percent of patients were male and 21% female. The indications for the procedure were Aortic Root Aneurysm (ARA) (65%), type A dissection (28%), infective endocarditis (4.4%) and prosthetic valve regurgitation (2.2%). Fifty-seven percent of these were performed electively and 43% as an emergency. A bicuspid aortic valve was present in 37%. Arch surgery was required in 15.7%, bypass grafting in 12.3% and mitral valve surgery in 5.6%. The descending aorta was involved in 16.8%. Operative mortality was 3.3% and in-hospital mortality 12.3%. Mean follow-up was 67.05 months (range 2-143). No patients required re-operation.CONCLUSIONS: The factors associated with increased in-hospital mortality were pre-operative haemodynamic instability, concommitant coronary artery disease and acute renal failure. The presence of a bicuspid valve may be associated with lower rates of complications, but no difference in mortality.","['Acute Kidney Injury', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aneurysm, Dissecting', 'Aorta, Thoracic', 'Aortic Aneurysm', 'Aortic Valve', 'Aortic Valve Insufficiency', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Coronary Artery Bypass', 'Coronary Disease', 'Elective Surgical Procedures', 'Emergencies', 'Endocarditis', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Heart Valve Prosthesis', 'Hemodynamics', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Humans', 'Intraoperative Complications', 'Length of Stay', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitral Valve', 'Postoperative Hemorrhage', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate', 'Young Adult']",23123058,"[['C12.777.419.780.050', 'C13.351.968.419.780.050'], ['M01.060.057'], ['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['C14.907.055.050'], ['A07.015.114.056.372'], ['C14.907.055.239', 'C14.907.109.139'], ['A07.541.510.110'], ['C14.280.484.048.500'], ['C14.280.067.198', 'C23.550.073.198'], ['E04.100.376.719.332', 'E04.100.814.868.750', 'E04.928.220.520.220'], ['C14.280.647.250', 'C14.907.585.250'], ['E04.249'], ['C23.550.291.781', 'N06.230.100.083', 'N06.850.376'], ['C14.280.282'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.249', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.350', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.350'], ['E07.695.310'], ['G09.330.380'], ['E05.318.308.985.550.400', 'N01.224.935.698.400', 'N06.850.505.400.975.550.400', 'N06.850.520.308.985.550.400'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C23.550.505'], ['E02.760.400.480', 'N02.421.585.400.480'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['A07.541.510.507'], ['C23.550.414.941', 'C23.550.767.850'], ['E05.318.372.500.500.500', 'E05.318.372.500.750.750', 'N05.715.360.330.500.500.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.825', 'N06.850.520.450.500.500.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.825'], ['E05.318.308.985.550.900', 'N01.224.935.698.826', 'N06.850.505.400.975.550.900', 'N06.850.520.308.985.550.900'], ['M01.060.116.815']]","['Diseases [C]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]']",1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
Influence of thyroid hormones on myelin proteins in the developing rat brain.,"This communication describes developmental changes in myelin proteins prepared from control, hypothyroid, and hyperthyroid rat brain. In the 10- to 37-day postnatal period studied, total myelin protein was found to double, and this change mainly reflected the increase in proteolipid and basic protein constituents. Thyroid states affect differentially the various myelin proteins. Hypothyroidism decreases the proteolipid and slow-moving basic protein, but has no effect on the fast basic or minor proteins. In hyperthyroidism, an increase was observed in proteolipid as well as both slow- and fast-moving proteins. The protein alterations were correlated to the changes previously found in lipid composition of myelin consequent upon hypo- and hyperthyroidism, and the role of thyroid hormones in brain development.","['Age Factors', 'Animals', 'Brain', 'Brain Chemistry', 'Depression, Chemical', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Female', 'Lipid Metabolism', 'Mice', 'Myelin Sheath', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins', 'Rabbits', 'Rats', 'Stimulation, Chemical', 'Thyroid Hormones', 'Thyroidectomy', 'Thyroxine']",1141955,"[['N05.715.350.075', 'N06.850.490.250'], ['B01.050'], ['A08.186.211'], ['G02.111.150', 'G03.185'], ['G07.690.773.750'], ['E05.196.401.402', 'E05.301.300.319'], ['G03.458'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500'], ['A08.637.600.500', 'A08.637.800.500', 'A08.675.542.512.560', 'A08.800.800.690.500', 'A10.755.503', 'A11.284.149.165.600', 'A11.650.600.500', 'A11.650.800.500', 'A11.671.501.512.560', 'A11.671.514.553'], ['D12.776.631'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.968.700'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700'], ['G07.690.773.996'], ['D06.472.931'], ['E04.270.856'], ['D06.472.931.812', 'D12.125.072.050.767']]","['Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
"Establishing and testing the ""reuse potential"" indicator for managing wastes as resources.","This study advances contemporary ideas promoting the importance of managing wastes as resources such as closed-loop or circular material economies, and sustainable materials management by reinforcing the notion of a resource-based paradigm rather than a waste-based one. It features the creation of a quantitative tool, the ""reuse potential indicator"" to specify how ""resource-like"" versus how ""waste-like"" specific materials are on a continuum. Even with increasing attention to waste reuse and resource conservation, constant changes in product composition and complexity have left material managers without adequate guidance to make decisions about what is technically feasible to recover from the discard stream even before markets can be considered. The reuse potential indicator is developed to aid management decision-making about waste based not on perception but more objectively on the technical ability of the materials to be reused in commerce. This new indicator is based on the extent of technological innovation and commercial application of actual reuse approaches identified and cataloged. Coal combustion by-products (CCBs) provide the test case for calculating the reuse potential indicator. While CCBs are often perceived as wastes and then isolated in landfills or surface impoundments, there is also a century-long history in the industry of developing technologies to reuse CCBs. The recent statistics show that most CCBs generated in Europe and Japan are reused (90-95%), but only 40-45% of CCBs are used in the United States. According to the reuse potential calculation, however, CCBs in the United States have high technical reusability. Of the four CCBs examined under three different regulatory schemes, reuse potential for boiler slag and flue-gas desulfurization gypsum maintains a value greater than 0.8 on a 0-1 scale, indicating they are at least 80% resource-like. Under current regulation in the United States, both fly ash and bottom ash are 80-90% resource-like. Very strict regulation would remove many reuse options decreasing potential for these two CCBs to 30% resource-like. A more holistic view of waste and broad application of the new indicator would make clear what technologies are available and assist public and private decision makers in setting quantitative material reuse targets from a new knowledge base that reinforces a resource-based paradigm.","['Coal Ash', 'Conservation of Natural Resources', 'Industrial Waste', 'Recycling', 'United States', 'Waste Management']",24594758,"[['D20.633.110'], ['J01.256', 'N06.230.080'], ['D20.944.420', 'N06.850.460.710.420'], ['N06.850.780.200.800.800.525', 'N06.850.860.510.244'], ['Z01.107.567.875'], ['N06.850.780.200.800.800.900', 'N06.850.860.510.900']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Geographicals [Z]']",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1
"Suicide Attempters, Suicide Ideators, and Non-Ideators.","Background: Suicide ideation is a prerequisite for suicide attempts. However, the majority of ideators will never act on their thoughts. It is therefore crucial to understand factors that differentiate those who consider suicide from those who make suicide attempts. Aim: Our aim was to investigate the role of protective factors in differentiating non-ideators, suicide ideators, and suicide attempters. Method: Inpatients without suicide ideation (n = 32) were compared with inpatients with current suicide ideation (n = 37) and with inpatients with current suicide ideation and a lifetime history of suicide attempts (n = 26) regarding positive mental health, self-esteem, trust in higher guidance, social support, and reasons for living. Results: Non-ideators reported more positive mental health, social support, reasons for living, and self-esteem than suicide ideators and suicide attempters did. No group differences were found regarding trust in higher guidance. Suicide ideators and suicide attempters did not differ regarding any of the study variables. Limitations: Results stem from a cross-sectional study of suicide attempts; thus, neither directionality nor generalizability to fatal suicide attempts can be determined. Conclusion: Various protective factors are best characterized to distinguish ideators from nonsuicidal inpatients. However, the same variables seem to offer no information about the difference between ideators and attempters.","['Adult', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Inpatients', 'Male', 'Mental Health', 'Middle Aged', 'Mood Disorders', 'Psychiatric Department, Hospital', 'Self Concept', 'Social Support', 'Somatoform Disorders', 'Spirituality', 'Suicidal Ideation', 'Suicide, Attempted']",30375243,"[['M01.060.116'], ['F03.080'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.643.470'], ['F02.418', 'N01.400.500'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['F03.600'], ['N02.278.216.500.968.641', 'N04.452.442.452.422.641'], ['F01.752.747.792'], ['I01.880.853.500.600'], ['F03.875'], ['F02.880.705', 'K01.844.664.500'], ['F01.145.126.980.875.149', 'I01.880.735.856.149'], ['F01.145.126.980.875.600', 'I01.880.735.856.600']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Humanities [K]']",0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0
Correlations between stochastic epidemics in two interacting populations.,"It is increasingly apparent that heterogeneity in the interaction between individuals plays an important role in the dynamics, persistence, evolution and control of infectious diseases. In epidemic modelling two main forms of heterogeneity are commonly considered: spatial heterogeneity due to the segregation of populations and heterogeneity in risk at the same location. The transition from random-mixing to heterogeneous-mixing models is made by incorporating the interaction, or coupling, within and between subpopulations. However, such couplings are difficult to measure explicitly; instead, their action through the correlations between subpopulations is often all that can be observed. Here, using moment-closure methodology supported by stochastic simulation, we investigate how the coupling and resulting correlation are related. We focus on the simplest case of interactions, two identical coupled populations, and show that for a wide range of parameters the correlation between the prevalence of infection takes a relatively simple form. In particular, the correlation can be approximated by a logistic function of the between population coupling, with the free parameter determined analytically from the epidemiological parameters. These results suggest that detailed case-reporting data alone may be sufficient to infer the strength of between population interaction and hence lead to more accurate mathematical descriptions of infectious disease behaviour.","['Communicable Diseases', 'Epidemics', 'Humans', 'Markov Chains', 'Models, Biological', 'Stochastic Processes']",30213654,"[['C01.221', 'C23.550.291.531'], ['N06.850.290.200'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E05.318.740.600.500', 'E05.318.740.996.500', 'G17.830.500', 'N05.715.360.750.625.500', 'N05.715.360.750.770.500', 'N06.850.520.830.600.500', 'N06.850.520.830.996.500'], ['E05.599.395'], ['E05.318.740.996', 'G17.830', 'N05.715.360.750.770', 'N06.850.520.830.996']]","['Diseases [C]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
Voxel-based analysis of PET amyloid ligand [11C]PIB uptake in Alzheimer disease.,"BACKGROUND: PET studies with N-methyl-[(11)C]2-(4':-methylaminophenyl)-6-hydroxybenzothiazole ([(11)C]PIB) have revealed an increased tracer uptake in several brain regions in Alzheimer disease (AD).OBJECTIVE: To employ voxel-based analysis method to identify brain regions with significant increases in [(11)C]PIB uptake in AD vs healthy control subjects, indicative of increased amyloid accumulation in these regions.METHODS: We studied 17 patients with AD and 11 control subjects with PET using [(11)C]PIB as tracer. Parametric images were computed by calculating a region-to-cerebellum ratio over 60 to 90 minutes in each voxel. Group differences in [(11)C]PIB uptake were analyzed with statistical parametric mapping (SPM) and automated region-of-interest (ROI) analysis.RESULTS: SPM showed increased uptake (p < 0.001) in the frontal, parietal, and lateral temporal cortices as well as in the posterior cingulate and the striatum. No significant differences in uptake were found in the primary sensory and motor cortices, primary visual cortex, thalamus, and medial temporal lobe. These results were supported by automated ROI analysis, with most prominent increases in AD subjects in the frontal cortex ([(11)C]PIB uptake 163% of the control mean) and posterior cingulate (146%) followed by the parietal (146%) and temporal (145%) cortices and striatum (133%), as well as small increases in the occipital cortex (117%) and thalamus (115%).CONCLUSIONS: Voxel-based analysis revealed widespread distribution of increased [(11)C]PIB uptake in Alzheimer disease (AD). These findings are in accordance with the distribution and phases of amyloid pathology in AD, previously documented in postmortem studies.","['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Alzheimer Disease', 'Amyloid beta-Peptides', 'Aniline Compounds', 'Benzothiazoles', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Carbon Radioisotopes', 'Cerebral Cortex', 'Corpus Striatum', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Image Processing, Computer-Assisted', 'Ligands', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Thiazoles', 'Up-Regulation']",16971697,"[['M01.060.116.100'], ['M01.060.116.100.080'], ['C10.228.140.380.100', 'C10.574.945.249', 'F03.615.400.100'], ['D12.644.024', 'D12.776.049.407.249.500', 'D12.776.543.039.500'], ['D02.092.146'], ['D03.383.129.708.089', 'D03.633.100.185'], ['A08.186.211'], ['E01.370.350.578.875.500', 'E01.370.376.537.625.500', 'E05.629.875.500'], ['D01.268.150.075.328', 'D01.496.123.328', 'D01.496.749.154'], ['A08.186.211.200.885.287.500'], ['A08.186.211.200.885.287.249.487'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['L01.224.308'], ['D27.720.470.480'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['E01.370.350.350.800.700', 'E01.370.350.600.350.800.399', 'E01.370.350.710.800.399', 'E01.370.350.825.800.399', 'E01.370.384.730.800.399'], ['E05.318.370.800.650', 'N05.715.360.325.700.640', 'N06.850.520.445.800.650'], ['D02.886.675', 'D03.383.129.708'], ['G02.111.905', 'G05.308.850', 'G07.690.773.998']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0
Drug-eluting stent treatment of a radiation-induced left internal mammary arterial graft stenosis.,"A 62-year-old man underwent radiotherapy to the left upper chest for treatment of Pancoast syndrome on a background of previous coronary artery bypass grafting 12 years earlier. Within 1 year, he developed significant stenoses of both the left internal mammary artery (LIMA) graft and ostial left vertebral artery, presumably related to therapeutic radiation exposure. Initially diagnosed using computed tomography coronary angiography, the patient underwent percutaneous coronary intervention and insertion of a drug-eluting stent (DES) to the ostium of the LIMA graft via a left radial approach. He remains clinically well at 6-month follow-up. This is the first reported case in the literature of DES treatment of a radiation-induced vascular stenosis; however, the incidence of cardiovascular disease is elevated in such cases. In patients with a prior history of mantle radiation, consideration should be given to the routine assessment of internal mammary conduits prior to coronary artery bypass surgery.","['Angioplasty, Balloon, Coronary', 'Coronary Angiography', 'Coronary Artery Bypass', 'Drug-Eluting Stents', 'Graft Occlusion, Vascular', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pancoast Syndrome', 'Radiation Injuries']",18787292,"[['E02.148.050.060.100', 'E04.100.376.719.100', 'E04.100.814.529.124.060.100', 'E04.100.814.529.968.050', 'E04.502.382.124.060.100', 'E04.502.382.968.050', 'E04.928.220.520.100', 'E05.157.016.060.100'], ['E01.370.350.130.625', 'E01.370.350.700.060.200', 'E01.370.370.050.200', 'E01.370.370.380.200'], ['E04.100.376.719.332', 'E04.100.814.868.750', 'E04.928.220.520.220'], ['E07.695.750.500'], ['C23.550.767.400'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['C04.588.894.797.520.734', 'C08.381.540.734', 'C08.785.520.734'], ['C26.733', 'G01.750.748.500', 'N06.850.460.350.850.500', 'N06.850.810.300.360']]","['Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Health Care [N]']",0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
Sites of clonidine action to inhibit gut propulsion in mice: demonstration of a central component.,"The role of central (supraspinal and spinal) and peripheral alpha-adrenoceptors in the regulation of gastrointestinal propulsion in the mouse was studied using clonidine, an alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonist. Clonidine produced a dose-dependent inhibition of propulsion when given intracerebroventricularly, intrathecally, or subcutaneously, but was most potent when given intracerebroventricularly. The antitransit effects of centrally given clonidine were antagonized by intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) yohimbine, but higher doses were required when this antagonist was given peripherally. Whereas i.c.v. and s.c. administration of clonidine were effective in inhibiting gut transit in spinally transected mice, intrathecal (i.th.) administration of this agonist was not. A supraspinal site of clonidine action is suggested based upon (a) the higher central to peripheral potency of clonidine; (b) the greater potency of i.c.v., compared with s.c., administration of yohimbine in blocking i.c.v. clonidine; (c) the lack of effect of i.th. administration of clonidine in spinally transected mice; and (d) the reduced potency of i.c.v., but not s.c., administration of clonidine in spinally transected mice. Additionally, a peripheral site of clonidine action is suggested by (a) the lower potency of i.c.v. yohimbine in blocking s.c., compared with i.c.v., clonidine; (b) the lower potency of i.c.v. yohimbine in blocking i.c.v. clonidine in transected mice (compared with normal mice); (c) the equal potency of s.c. clonidine in slowing propulsion in normal and spinally transected mice; and (d) the equal potency of i.c.v. yohimbine in blocking s.c. clonidine in normal and spinally transected mice. These data in mice would thus support the concept that normal (peripheral) therapeutic administration of clonidine would affect gut motor function by interactions within the brain and directly at the level of the gut.","['Animals', 'Clonidine', 'Gastrointestinal Transit', 'Injections, Intravenous', 'Injections, Intraventricular', 'Injections, Spinal', 'Injections, Subcutaneous', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred ICR', 'Prazosin', 'Receptors, Adrenergic, alpha', 'Spinal Cord', 'Yohimbine']",2844620,"[['B01.050'], ['D03.383.129.308.436.500'], ['E01.370.372.310', 'G10.261.360.525'], ['E02.319.267.082.750', 'E02.319.267.530.540'], ['E02.319.267.530.550'], ['E02.319.267.530.580'], ['E02.319.267.530.620'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500'], ['B01.050.050.199.520.520.510', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500.400.510'], ['D03.633.100.786.750'], ['D12.776.543.750.670.300.300.300', 'D12.776.543.750.695.150.300.300', 'D12.776.543.750.720.330.300.300'], ['A08.186.854'], ['D03.132.436.681.933', 'D03.633.100.473.402.681.933', 'D03.633.100.496.500.500.681.933']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Atropine with dipyridamole might theoretically combine to become a synergistic ischaemic stress test, by increasing myocardial oxygen demand through chronotropic stress and by reducing flow supply through a shortening of the diastolic interval under maximal coronary vasodilation. The aim of this study was to assess the effects of the addition of atropine to DET. Three hundred and twenty-one patients (age = 58 +/- 9 years), referred for testing in the echo lab, were initially studied by DET. Of these, 151 were stopped during or within the 2 min following dipyridamole infusion because of achievement of a predetermined end-point: obvious echocardiographic positivity (n = 137), severe chest pain (n = 3), diagnostic ST segment changes (n = 7) or limited side effects (n = 4). In another three cases, atropine was not given due to a history of glaucoma or severe prostatic hypertrophy. In the remaining 167 patients with a negative DET test, atropine (0.25 mg intravenously, repeated every min up to a maximum of 1 mg, if necessary) was added, starting 3 min after the end of the dipyridamole infusion. The dipyridamole-atropine echo test (DETA) was positive in 32 and negative in 135 patients, and no major side effects occurred in any patient.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Adult', 'Aged', 'Atropine', 'Blood Pressure', 'Coronary Angiography', 'Coronary Disease', 'Dipyridamole', 'Echocardiography', 'Female', 'Heart Rate', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",8223736,"[['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['D02.145.074.722.229.199', 'D03.132.760.180.572.199', 'D03.132.889.180.648.199', 'D03.605.084.500.722.229.199', 'D03.605.869.229.199'], ['E01.370.600.875.249', 'G09.330.380.076'], ['E01.370.350.130.625', 'E01.370.350.700.060.200', 'E01.370.370.050.200', 'E01.370.370.380.200'], ['C14.280.647.250', 'C14.907.585.250'], ['D03.383.742.175'], ['E01.370.350.130.750', 'E01.370.350.850.220', 'E01.370.370.380.220'], ['E01.370.600.875.500', 'G09.330.380.500'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['E05.318.370.800', 'E05.318.740.872', 'G17.800', 'N05.715.360.325.700', 'N05.715.360.750.725', 'N06.850.520.445.800', 'N06.850.520.830.872']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Health Care [N]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
The role of complement in cryoglobulin-induced immune complex glomerulonephritis.,"Many forms of glomerulonephritis are triggered by Ab localization in the glomerulus, but the mechanisms by which this induces glomerular inflammation are not fully understood. In this study we investigated the role of complement in a mouse model of cryoglobulin-induced immune complex glomerulonephritis. Several complement-deficient mice on a C57BL/6 and BALB/c genetic background were used and compared with strain-matched, wild-type controls. Cryoglobulinemia was induced by i.p. injection of 6-19 hybridoma cells producing an IgG3 cryoglobulin with rheumatoid factor activity against IgG2a of allotype a present in BALB/c, but not C57BL/6, mice. Thus, the cryoprecipitate in C57BL/6 mice consisted of the IgG3 cryoglobulin only (type I cryoglobulinemia) compared with IgG3-IgG2a complexes in BALB/c (type II cryoglobulinemia). The survival of mice was not affected by complement deficiency. Glomerular influx of neutrophils was significantly less in C3-, factor B-, and C5-deficient mice compared with wild-type and C1q-deficient mice. It did not correlate with C3 deposition, but did correlate with the amount of C6 deposited. Deficiency of CD59a, the membrane inhibitor of the membrane attack complex, did not induce an increase in neutrophil infiltration, suggesting that the generation of C5a accounts for the effects observed. There was no apparent difference between cryoglobulinemia types I and II regarding the role of complement. Our results suggest that in this model of cryoglobulin-induced glomerulonephritis the neutrophil influx was mediated by C5 activation with the alternative pathway playing a prominent role in its cleavage. Thus, blocking C5 is a potential therapeutic strategy for preventing renal injury in cryoglobulinemia.","['Animals', 'Complement System Proteins', 'Cryoglobulinemia', 'Female', 'Glomerulonephritis', 'Hybridomas', 'Immune Complex Diseases', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Neutrophils']",16272350,"[['B01.050'], ['D12.776.124.486.274'], ['C14.907.454.140', 'C15.378.147.780.243', 'C15.378.463.515.140', 'C20.683.780.250'], ['C12.777.419.570.363', 'C13.351.968.419.570.363'], ['A11.251.353.485', 'A11.251.600.485'], ['C20.543.520'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500'], ['B01.050.050.199.520.520.338', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500.400.338'], ['B01.050.050.199.520.520.420', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500.400.420'], ['B01.050.050.136.500.500', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500.550.455', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500.800.500'], ['A11.118.637.415.583', 'A11.627.340.583', 'A11.733.689', 'A15.145.229.637.415.583', 'A15.382.490.315.583', 'A15.382.680.689']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Motivation, effort and life circumstances as predictors of foot ulcers and amputations in people with Type 2 diabetes mellitus.","AIM: To investigate the predictive value of both patients' motivation and effort in their management of Type 2 diabetes and their life circumstances for the development of foot ulcers and amputations.METHODS: This study was based on the Diabetes Care in General Practice study and Danish population and health registers. The associations between patient motivation, effort and life circumstances and foot ulcer prevalence 6 years after diabetes diagnosis and the incidence of amputation in the following 13 years were analysed using odds ratios from logistic regression and hazard ratios from Cox regression models, respectively.RESULTS: Foot ulcer prevalence 6 years after diabetes diagnosis was 2.93% (95% CI 1.86-4.00) among 956 patients. General practitioners' indication of 'poor' vs 'very good' patient motivation for diabetes management was associated with higher foot ulcer prevalence (odds ratio 6.11, 95% CI 1.22-30.61). The same trend was seen for 'poor' vs 'good' influence of the patient's own effort in diabetes treatment (odds ratio 7.06, 95% CI 2.65-18.84). Of 1058 patients examined at 6-year follow-up, 45 experienced amputation during the following 13 years. 'Poor' vs 'good' influence of the patients' own effort was associated with amputation (hazard ratio 7.12, 95% CI 3.40-14.92). When general practitioners assessed the influence of patients' life circumstances as 'poor' vs 'good', the amputation incidence increased (hazard ratio 2.97, 95% CI 1.22-7.24). 'Poor' vs 'very good' patient motivation was also associated with a higher amputation incidence (hazard ratio 7.57, 95% CI 2.43-23.57), although not in fully adjusted models.CONCLUSIONS: General practitioners' existing knowledge of patients' life circumstances, motivation and effort in diabetes management should be included in treatment strategies to prevent foot complications.","['Amputation', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Denmark', 'Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2', 'Diabetic Foot', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Life Change Events', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Motivation', 'Patient Compliance', 'Prevalence', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Prospective Studies', 'Registries', 'Risk Factors', 'Self Care', 'Sex Factors']",25047765,"[['E04.555.080'], ['E02.186'], ['E05.318.372.500.875', 'N05.715.360.330.500.875', 'N06.850.520.450.500.875'], ['Z01.542.816.124'], ['C18.452.394.750.149', 'C19.246.300'], ['C14.907.320.191', 'C17.800.893.592.450.200', 'C19.246.099.500.191', 'C19.246.099.937.250'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.249', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.350', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.350'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E05.318.308.985.525.375', 'N01.224.935.597.500', 'N06.850.505.400.975.525.375', 'N06.850.520.308.985.525.375'], ['F01.829.458.410'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['F01.658', 'F01.752.543.500.750'], ['F01.100.150.750.500.600', 'F01.145.488.887.500.600', 'N05.300.150.800.500.600'], ['E05.318.308.985.525.750', 'N01.224.935.597.750', 'N06.850.505.400.975.525.750', 'N06.850.520.308.985.525.750'], ['E05.318.740.500.700', 'E05.318.740.600.700', 'E05.318.740.750.725', 'E05.318.740.998.825', 'E05.599.835.900', 'N05.715.360.750.530.650', 'N05.715.360.750.625.650', 'N05.715.360.750.695.650', 'N05.715.360.750.795.825', 'N06.850.520.830.500.700', 'N06.850.520.830.600.700', 'N06.850.520.830.750.725', 'N06.850.520.830.998.912'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.625', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.650', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.650'], ['E05.318.308.970', 'N04.452.859.819', 'N05.715.360.300.715.700', 'N06.850.520.308.970'], ['E05.318.740.600.800.725', 'N05.715.350.200.700', 'N05.715.360.750.625.700.700', 'N06.850.490.625.750', 'N06.850.520.830.600.800.725'], ['E02.900', 'I03.050.563', 'N02.421.784.680'], ['N05.715.350.675', 'N06.850.490.875']]","['Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]']",0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1
[The effect of performance of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures on successful treatment of hemopneumothorax in isolated thoracic trauma].,"Influence of performed diagnostic and therapeutic procedures on the outcome of the treatment of traumatic hemopneumothorax during isolated chest trauma. The aim of this study is the assessment of the influence of performed diagnostic and therapeutic procedures on the outcome of hemopneumothorax as a part of isolated chest trauma. The main group consists of 51 patients with hemopneumothorax. Patients with pneumothorax without effusion represent the first control group; the second control group consist of patients treated because of iatrogenic pneumothorax. In the main and control groups the analysis of clinical, roentgenographic and functional parameters was made, together with the analysis of particular therapeutic procedures, the estimation of the success of the treatment was based on roentgenographic and functional parameters. The higher incidence of hemopneumothorax compared with control groups during chest trauma in the analyzed material is statistically significant. The occurrence of bilateral hemopneumothorax in 10% of cases emphasizes the need of adequate roentgenographic assessment of injured patients. Regardless of the intensity of the trauma, symptoms do not always indicate the existence of hemopneumothorax. The number of fractured ribs is not of significant importance in terms of the occurrence of hemopneumothorax or pneumothorax. Severe dyspnea can be accompanied even with a smaller collapse of the lung independently of the amount of blood in the pleural cavity. Oxygenation in the arterial blood is impaired with the great and small pulmonary collapse. Hemodynamic disorders existed in 14% all cases. The higher frequency of operative treatment in the main group is statistically significant. The majority of cases of traumatic hemopneumothorax can be successfully treated by the conservative treatment. Accompanying complications do not have greater influence on the outcome.","['Adult', 'Hemopneumothorax', 'Humans', 'Iatrogenic Disease', 'Middle Aged', 'Thoracic Injuries']",8975526,"[['M01.060.116'], ['C08.528.338', 'C23.550.414.904.500'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C23.550.291.875'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['C26.891']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]']",0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
Involvement of anion channels in mediating elicitor-induced ATP efflux in Salvia miltiorrhiza hairy roots.,"This study examines the roles of anion channels and ATP binding cassette (ABC) protein transporters in mediating elicitor-induced ATP release in Salvia miltiorrhiza hairy root cultures. The elicitor-induced ATP release was effectively blocked by two putative membrane anion channel blockers, niflumic acid and Zn(2+), but not by a specific Cl(-) channel blocker, phenylanthranilic acid. The elicitor-induced ATP release was also significantly suppressed by two ABC inhibitors, glibenclamide and ethacrynic acid. Notable ATP release from the hairy roots was also induced by verapamil (2mM), an ABC activator in animal cells. The verapamil-induced ATP release was effectively blocked by niflumic acid, but only slightly inhibited by the ABC inhibitors. Another notable effect of verapamil was the induction of exocytosis, the secretion of vesicle-like particles to the root surface. The verapamil-induced exocytosis was not inhibited by nifulumic acid and YE did not induce the exocytosis. Overall, the results suggest a significant role of anion channels, a possible involvement of ABC proteins and no significant involvement of exocytosis in mediating the ATP efflux in hairy root cells.","['ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters', 'Adenosine Triphosphate', 'Exocytosis', 'Ion Channels', 'Plant Roots', 'Salvia miltiorrhiza']",20813428,"[['D12.776.157.530.100', 'D12.776.395.550.020', 'D12.776.543.550.192', 'D12.776.543.585.100'], ['D03.633.100.759.646.138.236', 'D13.695.667.138.236', 'D13.695.827.068.236'], ['G04.468'], ['D12.776.157.530.400', 'D12.776.543.550.450', 'D12.776.543.585.400'], ['A18.400'], ['B01.650.940.800.575.912.250.583.520.922.750']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Organisms [B]']",1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Doppler color flow imaging surveillance of deep vein thrombosis in high-risk trauma patients.,"To determine the prevalence of upper and lower extremity deep vein thrombosis in high-risk trauma patients, 136 consecutive high-risk trauma patients were prospectively evaluated with weekly Doppler color flow imaging. Incomplete compressibility and visualized intraluminal thrombus were considered diagnostic of deep vein thrombosis. Pulmonary embolus was documented by pulmonary arteriography. Deep vein thrombosis occurred at 27 non-contiguous sites in 19 patients (14%). Eight of 27 cases of deep vein thrombosis (30%) involved the upper extremity and 19 (70%) occurred in the lower extremity. Twenty-one of 27 deep vein thromboses (78%) were partially occlusive, whereas six (22%) were occlusive. Pulmonary embolus was documented in three patients (2.2%).

Splenic norepinephrine and serum corticosterone level fluctuations associated with bacteria-induced stress.,"Corticosterone (CORT) and norepinephrine (NE), two effector molecules of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) and the sympathetic-lymphoid (SL) axes, respectively, differentially influence murine host resistance to Listeria monocytogenes (LM). Serum CORT and splenic NE levels early (< or =24 h) after infection correlated positively with host resistance, as long as the LM burden did not exceed approximately 10(6) cfu LM per spleen. As previously reported, mice with right-circling preference (R-mice) have significantly greater host resistance to LM than those with left-circling preference (L-mice) and early after infection, R-mice had significantly higher serum CORT levels than L-mice. However, rapid pathogenesis with a high bacterial burden induced high activation of the HPA and SL axes, which prevented observable differences in the defense against LM, especially later in infection. With the high bacterial inoculum (10(5) LM), the splenic NE levels significantly increased, but no differences among R- and L-mice were discernible. We suggest that endogenous asymmetry of neuroimmune circuits contributes to differential host resistance, but the level of stress (bacterial inoculum) is critical. With regard to the neuroendocrine factors assessed, CORT, but not NE, levels significantly correlated with the enhanced defenses of R-mice in comparison to L-mice. The differential host resistance based on brain laterality seems to be more a function of the HPA axis and possibly other CNS effects on peripheral immunity than neurotransmitter release by the sympathetic innervation of the spleen.","['Animals', 'Behavior, Animal', 'Corticosterone', 'Listeriosis', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Neuroimmunomodulation', 'Norepinephrine', 'Organ Size', 'Spleen', 'Stress, Physiological']",15316243,"[['B01.050'], ['F01.145.113'], ['D04.210.500.745.745.654.237', 'D06.472.040.585.353.237'], ['C01.150.252.410.514'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500'], ['B01.050.050.199.520.520.338', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500.400.338'], ['G07.265.758', 'G11.561.630', 'G12.535.575'], ['D02.033.100.291.502', 'D02.092.063.480', 'D02.092.211.215.746', 'D02.092.311.830', 'D02.455.426.559.389.657.166.175.830'], ['E01.370.600.115.100.660', 'E05.041.124.715', 'G07.100.100.660', 'G07.345.249.690'], ['A10.549.700', 'A15.382.520.604.700'], ['G07.775']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
A density functional investigation of the extradiol cleavage mechanism in non-heme iron catechol dioxygenases.,"The mechanism for extradiol cleavage in non-heme iron catechol dioxygenase was modelled theoretically via density functional theory. Based on the Fe(II)-His,His,Glu motif observed in enzymes, an active site model complex, [Fe(acetate)(imidazole)(2)(catecholate)(O(2))](-), was optimized for states with six, four and two unpaired electrons (U6, U4 and U2, respectively). The transfer of the terminal atom of the coordinated dioxygen leading to ""ferryl"" Fe=O intermediates spontaneously generates an extradiol epoxide. The computed barriers range from 19 kcal mol(-1) on the U6 surface to approximately 25 kcal mol(-1) on the U4 surface, with overall reaction energies of +11.6, 6.3 and 7.1 kcal mol(-1) for U6, U4 and U2, respectively. The calculations for a protonated process reveal the terminal oxygen of O(2) to be the thermodynamically favoured site but subsequent oxygen transfer to the catechol has a barrier of approximately 30-40 kcal mol(-1), depending on the spin state. Instead, protonating the acetate group gives a slightly higher energy species but a subsequent barrier on the U4 surface of only 7 kcal mol(-1) relative to the hydroperoxide complex. The overall exoergicity increases to 13 kcal mol(-1). The favoured proton-assisted pathway does not involve significant radical character and has features reminiscent of a Criegee rearrangement which involves the participation of the aromatic ring pi-orbitals in the formation of the new carbon-oxygen bond. The subsequent collapse of the epoxide, attack by the coordinated hydroxide and final product formation proceeds with an overall exoergicity of approximately 75 kcal mol(-1) on the U4 surface.","['Catechols', 'Estradiol', 'Heme', 'Nonheme Iron Proteins', 'Oxygenases']",12761662,"[['D02.455.426.559.389.657.166'], ['D04.210.500.365.415.248', 'D06.472.334.851.437.500'], ['D03.383.129.578.840.500.640.587', 'D03.633.400.909.500.640.587', 'D04.345.783.500.640.587', 'D23.767.727.640.587'], ['D12.776.157.427.374', 'D12.776.556.579.374'], ['D08.811.682.690']]",['Chemicals and Drugs [D]'],0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Value of computed axial tomography in severe laryngeal injury.,"Two cases of severe laryngeal injuries were evaluated by computed axial tomography (CT). Results of these studies correlated well with surgical findings and were helpful in planning structural repair.

In addition, the method proved more advantageous than contrast laryngography, which is often impossible to perform in the presence of massive swelling.","['Adult', 'Humans', 'Larynx', 'Male', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed']",7092690,"[['M01.060.116'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['A04.329'], ['E01.370.350.350.810', 'E01.370.350.600.350.700.810', 'E01.370.350.700.700.810', 'E01.370.350.700.810.810', 'E01.370.350.825.810.810']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
Effect of intravenous glucagon on the biliary secretion of a cholangiographic agent in man.,"This study was undertaken in an attempt to define the mechanism whereby intravenous glucagon enhanced bile duct and gallbladder opacification at the time of infusion cholangiography. Seven post-operative gallstone patients with indwelling t-tubes were given a 1 h infusion of intravenous iotroxamide at a rate of 4.1 mg/kg body weight/min. Bile samples were collected by gravity drainage and assayed for iotroxamide and hence biliary iodine concentration. At the end of the 1 h infusion the mean biliary excretion rate (+/- s.e.m.) of iotroxamide was 26.1 +/- 3.4 mg/min and the iodine concentration in bile 9.7 +/- 1.2 mg/ml. 1 mg of intravenous glucagon given over 30 s at the end of the iotroxamide infusion produced a significant increase in bile flow (P less than 0.01). The excretion rate of iotroxamide rose rapidly following glucagon to reach a peak value of 43.8 +/- 8.1 mg/min 5 min after the glucagon (P less than 0.05). The enhanced biliary excretion of iotroxamide resulting from the glucagon injection was significant (P less than 0.05) 1, 3 and 5 but not 10 min after the hormone. The intravenous glucagon also caused a small but significant (P less than 0.05) elevation of the biliary iodine concentration to 10.9 +/- 1.2 mg/ml, 3 min after its injection, but by 5 min post-glucagon the iodine concentration in bile had reversed to pre-injection levels. The possible clinical implications of these results are discussed.","['Adult', 'Aged', 'Bile', 'Cholangiography', 'Contrast Media', 'Drug Interactions', 'Female', 'Glucagon', 'Humans', 'Iodine', 'Iodipamide', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Time Factors']",7214805,"[['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['A12.200.087'], ['E01.370.350.700.715.200', 'E01.370.372.200'], ['D27.505.259.500', 'D27.720.259'], ['G07.690.773.968'], ['D06.472.699.587.730.500', 'D12.644.548.586.730.500'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D01.268.380.400'], ['D02.241.223.100.400.880.380', 'D02.455.426.559.389.127.375.880.380'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['G01.910.857']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
[Intraoperative measurement of stapes mobility using a hand-guided electromagnetic probe].,"BACKGROUND: The hearing results of otosurgery are still unsatisfactory. Even after successful implantation of middle ear prostheses there often remains an air bone gap of 30 dB or more. As possible reasons dislocation of the prostheses due to scar growth, changes in prostheses' attachment or ventilation disorders are being discussed. Decreased stapes mobility, which has been judged only manually up to now, is supposed to be a further reason.METHOD: We are introducing a new electromagnetic probe. The output signal of this device is proportional to the impedance of the stapes-annular ligament cochlear fluid system at the sensor's resonance frequency (2.4 kHz). The advantage of this system is characterised by its hand-guidance. Injury of the sensitive stapes-annular ligament due to tremor movements of the surgeon can be excluded using a special construction of the sensor head. The maximum force of the sensor's tip onto the stapes during measurement is limited to below 5 mN.RESULTS: Preliminary measurement results of 20 patients are presented with normal and abnormal stapes mobility. These results are compared to the subjective impression of the surgeon, who usually tested the stapes mobility by hand. As a result of our investigations probe measurements can detect more exactly decreased mobility of the stapes than the surgeon.CONCLUSIONS: Our device may help to detect latent stapes fixation caused by chronic inflammation of the middle ear. The intraoperative measurement of stapes mobility may influence the strategy of the surgeon. Furthermore it would be helpful in patient consulting prior to a revision-tympanoplasty with predicting the potential hearing improvement.","['Cholesteatoma, Middle Ear', 'Electromagnetic Phenomena', 'Humans', 'Movement', 'Otitis Media', 'Otosclerosis', 'Stapes', 'Tympanoplasty']",11253568,"[['C09.218.200', 'C17.800.428.260.300'], ['G01.358.500'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['G07.568', 'G11.427.410'], ['C09.218.705.663'], ['C09.218.768'], ['A09.246.397.247.806'], ['E04.580.450.873']]","['Diseases [C]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
A single (99m)Tc-MIBI study to predict response to neoadjuvant treatment in sarcoma patiens.,"Technetium-99m methoxy isobutyl isonitrile ((99m)Tc-MIBI) was used as a tumour imaging agent to predict the response of neoadjuvant treatment in patients with bone and soft tissue sarcoma. Our study included 31 patients (M:F = 23:8), 17 having osteosarcomas and 14 with soft-tissues sarcomas. Scintigraphy with (99m)Tc-MIBI was performed before the initiation of the neoadjuvant treatment. Static images were acquired at 10 and 60min post-injection and lesion to normal (L/N) ratios and washout rates (WR%) were calculated. Tumour response was assessed by detecting percent necrosis in a surgically resected specimen. Responses were correlated and compared with WR%. Percentage of tumour necrosis was 71.35±20.20% (mean±SD) with eight good and 23 poor responses. On visual analysis, 16 showed homogeneous, 11 heterogeneous and 4 doughnut shaped pattern of uptake. Seventy five percent of good responders had homogeneous uptake. Early and delayed L/N ratios were significantly different in both good and poor responders (P=0.006 and P<0.001, respectively) but correlated poorly with the tumour necrosis values in the specimen (R=0.23 and 0.06 respectively). Mean washout rate was 26.13±11.25% (median = 29%) and there was weak correlation between tumour necrosis and WR% (r=-0.32, P=0.029). The mean WR% of good responders was 15.0±10.0% and that of poor responders was significantly higher (30.1±8.8%, P=0.003). Good responders by 88% were below the median cut-of value. In conclusion WR% of (99m)Tc-MIBI may be used before surgery to identify poor responders to neoadjuvant treatment in patients with bone and soft tissue sarcomas.","['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Bone Neoplasms', 'Child', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Necrosis', 'Neoadjuvant Therapy', 'Osteosarcoma', 'Prognosis', 'Radionuclide Imaging', 'Radiopharmaceuticals', 'Sarcoma', 'Soft Tissue Neoplasms', 'Technetium Tc 99m Sestamibi', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",21761016,"[['M01.060.057'], ['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['C04.588.149', 'C05.116.231'], ['M01.060.406'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['C23.550.717'], ['E02.186.450'], ['C04.557.450.565.575.650', 'C04.557.450.795.620'], ['E01.789'], ['E01.370.350.710', 'E01.370.384.730'], ['D27.505.259.843', 'D27.505.519.871', 'D27.720.470.410.650'], ['C04.557.450.795'], ['C04.588.839'], ['D02.626.872', 'D02.691.825.937'], ['E01.789.800', 'N04.761.559.590.800', 'N05.715.360.575.575.800'], ['M01.060.116.815']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Health Care [N]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
Evidence for the occurrence of photorespiration in synurophyte algae.,"The fluxes of CO(2) and oxygen during photosynthesis by cell suspensions of Tessellaria volvocina and Mallomonas papillosa were monitored mass spectrometrically. There was no rapid uptake of CO(2,) only a slow drawdown to compensation concentrations of 26 ìM for T. volvocina and 18 ìM for M. papillosa, when O(2) evolution ceased, indicating a lack of active bicarbonate uptake by the cells. Darkening of the cells after a period of photosynthesis did not cause rapid release of CO(2), indicating the absence of an intracellular inorganic carbon pool. However, upon darkening a brief burst of CO(2) was observed similar to the post-illumination burst characteristic of C(3) higher plants. Treatment of the cells of both species with the membrane-permeable carbonic anhydrase inhibitor ethoxyzolamide had no adverse effect on photosynthetic rate, but stimulated the dark CO(2) burst indicating the dark oxidation of a compound formed in the light. In the absence of any active accumulation of inorganic carbon photosynthesis in these species should be inhibited by O(2). This was investigated in four synurophyte species T. volvocina, M. papillosa, Synura petersenii, and Synura uvella: photosynthetic O(2) evolution rates in all four algae, measured by O(2) electrode, were significantly higher (40-50%) in media at low O(2) (4%) than in air-equilibrated (21% O(2)) media, indicating an O(2) inhibition of photosynthesis (Warburg effect) and thus the occurrence of photorespiration in these species.","['Bicarbonates', 'Carbon', 'Carbon Dioxide', 'Cell Respiration', 'Chrysophyta', 'Ethoxzolamide', 'Kinetics', 'Light', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Oxygen', 'Photosynthesis', 'Ribulose-Bisphosphate Carboxylase', 'Time Factors']",21442299,"[['D01.200.275.150.100', 'D01.248.497.158.165.100'], ['D01.268.150'], ['D01.200.200', 'D01.362.150', 'D01.650.550.200'], ['G03.197', 'G04.270'], ['B01.750.150'], ['D02.065.884.500', 'D02.886.590.700.420', 'D02.886.675.197', 'D03.383.129.708.089.416', 'D03.633.100.185.416'], ['G01.374.661', 'G02.111.490'], ['G01.358.500.505.650', 'G01.590.540', 'G01.750.250.650', 'G01.750.770.578'], ['G02.700', 'G03.295.531'], ['D01.268.185.550', 'D01.362.670'], ['G02.111.158.937', 'G02.111.669.700', 'G02.740.921', 'G03.191.937', 'G03.493.700', 'G03.800.700', 'G15.568'], ['D08.811.520.224.125.800', 'D12.776.765.199.499'], ['G01.910.857']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]']",0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

"Maternal lipids are associated with newborn adiposity, independent of GDM status, obesity and insulin resistance: a prospective observational cohort study.","OBJECTIVE: To determine the association between maternal lipaemia and neonatal anthropometrics in Malaysian mother-offspring pairs.DESIGN: Prospective observational cohort study.SETTING: Single tertiary multidisciplinary antenatal clinic in Malaysia.POPULATION: A total of 507 mothers: 145 with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM); 94 who were obese with normal glucose tolerance (NGT) (pre-gravid body mass index, BMI ? 27.5 kg/m2 ), and 268 who were not obese with NGT.METHODS: Maternal demographic, anthropometric, and clinical data were collected during an interview/examination using a structured questionnaire. Blood was drawn for insulin, C-peptide, triglyceride (Tg), and non-esterified fatty acid (NEFA) during the 75-g 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) screening, and again at 36 weeks of gestation. At birth, neonatal anthropometrics were assessed and data such as gestational weight gain (GWG) were extracted from the records.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Macrosomia, large-for-gestational-age (LGA) status, cohort-specific birthweight (BW), neonatal fat mass (NFM), and sum of skinfold thickness (SSFT) > 90th centile.RESULTS: Fasting Tg > 95th centile (3.6 mmol/L) at screening for OGTT was independently associated with LGA (adjusted odds ratio, aOR 10.82, 95% CI 1.26-93.37) after adjustment for maternal glucose, pre-gravid BMI, and insulin sensitivity. Fasting glucose was independently associated with a birthweight ratio (BWR) of >90th centile (aOR 2.06, 95% CI 1.17-3.64), but not with LGA status, in this well-treated GDM cohort with pre-delivery HbA1c of 5.27%.

Clinical use of indices determined non-invasively from the radial and carotid pressure waveforms.,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the clinical use of radial and carotid artery applanation tonometry as an independent supplement to cuff sphygmomanometry.METHODS: In 44 patients, radial and carotid tonometric pressure recordings were taken at short intervals apart by two persons who had prolonged experience with both. Comparisons were made between directly recorded radial and carotid waveforms and between aortic waves synthesized from both, using SphygmoCor. Focus was on waveform features: time intervals between wavefoot and incisura, denoting ejection duration, between wavefoot and first systolic peak or shoulder T1, and augmentation index - the rise in pressure from this point to systolic peak divided by pulse pressure.RESULTS: No patient had discomfort with radial tonometry, whereas many found carotid tonometry uncomfortable. Beat-to-beat variability was lower for the radial than carotid site. The device's operator ""quality index"" was achieved for 78% of radial waveforms but just 20% of carotid waveforms (P<0.05). Interobserver variability was lower for all indices derived from radial, cf. carotid, waveforms. For the two observers combined, there was no difference between aortic indices determined from carotid and radial sites except for T1 (radial-derived 117+ or -17 ms, cf. carotid-derived 103+ or -17 ms, P<0.05), but this did not influence the value of augmentation index (radial-derived 26+ or -13%, cf. carotid-derived 28+ or -14%, P=NS).CONCLUSION: The present study conforms with most published results, and indicates superiority of radial to carotid tonometry in clinical practice.","['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Aorta', 'Blood Pressure', 'Blood Pressure Determination', 'Carotid Arteries', 'Humans', 'Middle Aged', 'Observer Variation', 'Radial Artery', 'Ventricular Function, Left']",16810032,"[['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['M01.060.116.100.080'], ['A07.015.114.056'], ['E01.370.600.875.249', 'G09.330.380.076'], ['E01.370.370.140', 'E01.370.600.100'], ['A07.015.114.186'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['E01.354.753', 'N02.421.450.600', 'N05.715.350.150.675', 'N06.850.490.500.250'], ['A07.015.114.740'], ['G09.330.955.800']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Health Care [N]']",1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
Effects of HCl-pepsin laryngeal instillations on upper airway patency-maintaining mechanisms.,"Gastroesophageal reflux has been indicated as an etiopathological factor in disorders of the upper airway. Upper airway collapsing pressure stimulates pressure-responsive laryngeal receptors that reflexly increase the activity of upper airway abductor muscles. We studied, in anesthetized dogs, the effects of repeated laryngeal instillations of HCl-pepsin (HCl-P; pH = 2) on the response of laryngeal afferent endings and the posterior cricoarytenoid muscle (PCA) to negative pressure. The effect of negative pressure on receptor discharge or PCA activity was evaluated by comparing their response to upper airway (UAO) and tracheal occlusions (TO). It is only during UAO, but not during TO, that the larynx is subjected to negative transmural pressure. HCl-P instillation decreased the rate of discharge during UAO of the 10 laryngeal receptors studied from 56.4 +/- 10.9 (SE) to 38.2 +/- 9.2 impulses/s (P < 0.05). With UAO, the peak PCA moving time average, normalized by dividing it by the peak values of esophageal pressure, decreased after six HCl-P trials from 4.29 +/- 0.31 to 2.23 +/- 0.18 (n = 6; P < 0.05). The responses to TO of either receptors or PCA remained unaltered. We conclude that exposure of the laryngeal mucosa to HCl-P solutions, as it may occur with gastroesophageal reflux, impairs the patency-maintaining mechanisms provided by laryngeal sensory feedback. Inflammatory and necrotic alterations of the laryngeal mucosa are likely responsible for these effects.","['Animals', 'Catheterization', 'Dogs', 'Gastroesophageal Reflux', 'Hydrochloric Acid', 'Laryngeal Muscles', 'Larynx', 'Mechanoreceptors', 'Pepsin A', 'Reflex', 'Respiratory System']",9516196,"[['B01.050'], ['E02.148', 'E05.157'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.750.250.216.200'], ['C06.405.117.119.500.484'], ['D01.029.260.326', 'D01.210.450'], ['A02.633.567.500', 'A04.329.604'], ['A04.329'], ['A08.675.650.915.750', 'A08.800.950.750', 'A11.671.650.915.750'], ['D08.811.277.656.074.500.700', 'D08.811.277.656.300.048.700'], ['E01.370.376.550.650', 'E01.370.600.550.650', 'F02.830.702', 'G11.561.731'], ['A04']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
A new technique for measuring the cell growth and metabolism of endothelial cells seeded on vascular prostheses.,"For the improvement of vascular graft patency, an endothelial cell (EC) lining is desirable. It is essential that the EC remains viable after being seeded onto the prosthetic graft. The aim of this study was to adapt an Alamar redox assay (ABRA) as a technique to monitor the viability of ECs seeded on prosthetic grafts. To test the graft types, we seeded human umbilical vein ECs on compliant polyurethane (CPU), expanded polytetrafluoroethylene, and Dacron at a density of 2 x 10(5) cell/cm(2). After 24 h of incubation, ABRA was added, and the absorbance was measured at 4, 8, and 24 h. To assess seeded cell concentrations on grafts, we seeded CPU at densities ranging from 1 x 10(5) to 8 x 10(5) cell/cm(2). The validity of the test was assessed with sodium azide and mitomycin C, known physiological perturbators. ABRA reduction demonstrated that ECs were viable and functional postseeding on the prosthetic grafts. A significant correlation was observed with ABRA reduction and cell concentrations (p < 0.001). The acid phosphatase assay demonstrated enzyme activity in the cells, but they were not maintained under normal physiological conditions. The ABRA bioreduced product was soluble, stable, and noncytotoxic over 24 h. The assay is independent of the geometry or physiochemistry of the graft type. The technique allows the continuous assessment of the metabolism and viability of seeded cells, is simple to perform, and does not destroy the cells or graft materials.","['Biocompatible Materials', 'Bioprosthesis', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cell Division', 'Endothelium, Vascular', 'Humans', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Polymers']",11288093,"[['D25.130', 'D27.720.102.130', 'J01.637.051.130'], ['E07.695.100'], ['A07.015'], ['G04.144.220', 'G04.161.750.500', 'G05.113', 'G07.345.249.410.750.500'], ['A07.015.700.500', 'A10.272.491.355'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['G02.700', 'G03.295.531'], ['D05.750', 'D25.720', 'J01.637.051.720']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
Affinity purification of viral protein having heterogeneous quaternary structure: modeling the impact of soluble aggregates on chromatographic performance.,"Prokaryote-expressed polyomavirus structural protein VP1 with an N-terminal glutathione-S-transferase tag (GST-VP1) self-assembles into pentamer structures that further organize into soluble aggregates of variable size (3.4 x 10(2)-1.8 x 10(4)kDa) [D.I. Lipin, L.H.L. Lua, A.P.J. Middelberg, J. Chromatogr. A 1190 (2008) 204]. The adsorption mechanism for the full range of GST-VP1 soluble aggregates was described assuming a dual-component model [T.Y. Gu, G.J. Tsai, G.T. Tsao, AICHE J. 37 (1991) 1333], with components differentiated by size, and hence pore accessibility, rather than by protein identity. GST-VP1 protein was separated into two component groups: aggregates small enough to access resin pores (LMW: 3.4 x 10(2)-1.4 x 10(3)kDa) and aggregates excluded from the resin pores (HMW: 9.0 x 10(2)-1.8 x 10(4)kDa). LMW aggregates bound to resin at a higher saturation concentration (29.7 g L(-1)) than HMW aggregates (13.3 g L(-1)), while the rate of adsorption of HMW aggregates was an order of magnitude higher than for LMW aggregates. The model was used to predict both batch and packed bed adsorption of GST-VP1 protein in solutions with known concentrations of HMW and LMW aggregates to Glutathione Sepharose HP resin. Asymmetrical flow field flow fractionation with UV absorbance was utilized in conjunction with adsorption experimentation to show that binding of HMW aggregates to the resin was strong enough to withstand model-predicted displacement by LMW aggregates. High pore concentrations of LMW aggregates were also found to significantly inhibit the diffusion rate of further protein in the resin pores. Additional downstream processing experimentation showed that enzymatic cleavage of LMW aggregates to remove GST tags yields more un-aggregated VP1 pentamers than enzymatic cleavage of HMW aggregates. This model can be used to enhance the chromatographic capture of GST-VP1, and suggests an approach for modeling chromatographic purification of proteins that have a range of quaternary structures, including soluble aggregates.","['Adsorption', 'Chromatography, Affinity', 'Escherichia coli', 'Models, Theoretical', 'Molecular Weight', 'Particle Size', 'Polyomavirus', 'Porosity', 'Protein Binding', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins', 'Resins, Synthetic', 'Viral Proteins']",19540501,"[['G01.030', 'G02.020'], ['E05.196.181.400.170'], ['B03.440.450.425.325.300', 'B03.660.250.150.180.100'], ['E05.599'], ['G02.494'], ['G02.712'], ['B04.280.210.700.615', 'B04.613.204.670.615'], ['G01.374.710'], ['G02.111.679', 'G03.808'], ['D12.776.828.300'], ['D05.750.716.822', 'D25.339.816', 'D25.720.716.822', 'J01.637.051.339.816', 'J01.637.051.720.716.822'], ['D12.776.964']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]']",0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
Caspase inhibition protects nigral neurons against 6-OHDA-induced retrograde degeneration.,"6-Hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) administered intrastriatally to adult rats in a single injection causes neurodegeneration of the nigrostriatal pathway and loss of > 50% of dopamine neurons in substantia nigra pars compacta 30 days after administration. The death of nigral neurons occurs, at least partially, by a caspase-mediated mechanism. The nigral loss of dopaminergic neurons could be prevented by stereotaxical administration of zVAD.fmk, a caspase inhibitor, into the substantia nigra, indicating that 6-OHDA-induced nigrostriatal degeneration involves caspase activation. These results suggest that caspases are probably involved in neurodegenerative chronic processes such as Parkinson's disease and might be considered as possible targets in the treatment of such neurological disorders.","['Amino Acid Chloromethyl Ketones', 'Animals', 'Caspase Inhibitors', 'Corpus Striatum', 'Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors', 'Male', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurons', 'Neuroprotective Agents', 'Oxidopamine', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley']",10574377,"[['D12.125.065'], ['B01.050'], ['D27.505.519.389.745.325.500'], ['A08.186.211.200.885.287.249.487'], ['D27.505.519.389.745.325'], ['C23.550.737'], ['A08.675', 'A11.671'], ['D27.505.696.706.548', 'D27.505.954.427.575'], ['D02.092.311.342.478.650', 'D02.455.426.559.389.657.166.175.342.478.650'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700.750']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Diseases [C]']",1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Intraobserver and interobserver consistency for grading esophagitis with narrow-band imaging.,"BACKGROUND: Narrow-band imaging (NBI) is a novel, noninvasive optical technique that adjusts reflected light to enhance the contrast between the esophageal mucosa and the gastric mucosa. Whether the use of this optical technique may increase consistency in describing the presence and severity of mucosal breaks remains elusive.OBJECTIVES: We compared the intra- and interobserver variations in the endoscopic scoring of esophagitis by using conventional imaging with and without NBI.DESIGN: Cross-sectional study of consecutive patients with reflux.SETTING: Single center in Taiwan.PATIENTS: Endoscopic photographs of 230 patients with gastroesophageal reflux were obtained with both methods. Images were randomly displayed twice to 7 endoscopists, who independently scored each photograph by using the Los Angeles classification.MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: We calculated intra- and interobserver kappa statistics to measure the consistency in interpretations.RESULTS: With the addition of NBI, intraobserver reproducibility significantly improved with 3 of the 7 endoscopists. Interobserver reproducibility was more consistent with the combined approach than with conventional imaging alone, with an improved overall kappa value of 0.62 versus 0.45 (P < .05). Discordance between these methods was substantial in the grading of class A or B esophagitis.LIMITATIONS: A small sample of class D esophagitis might have produced insufficient statistical power in this category.CONCLUSIONS: Intra- and interobserver reproducibilities in grading esophagitis could be improved when NBI was applied with conventional imaging. The benefit appeared to derive from better depictions of small erosive foci.","['Esophagitis', 'Esophagoscopy', 'Esophagus', 'Gastric Mucosa', 'Humans', 'Mucous Membrane', 'Observer Variation', 'Video Recording']",17643694,"[['C06.405.117.620', 'C06.405.205.663'], ['E01.370.372.250.250.275', 'E01.370.388.250.250.250.260', 'E04.210.240.250.260', 'E04.502.250.250.250.260'], ['A03.556.875.500'], ['A03.556.875.875.440', 'A10.615.550.291'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['A10.615.550'], ['E01.354.753', 'N02.421.450.600', 'N05.715.350.150.675', 'N06.850.490.500.250'], ['L01.280.960']]","['Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Information Science [L]']",1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0
Low CD4+ T cell count is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease events in the HIV outpatient study.,"BACKGROUND: Traditional cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, and antiretroviral (ARV) agents have been associated with CVD events in HIV-infected patients. We investigated the association of low CD4(+) T lymphocyte cell count with incident CVD in a cohort of outpatients treated in 10 HIV specialty clinics in the United States.METHODS: We studied patients who were under observation from 1 January 2002 (baseline), categorized them according to National Cholesterol Education Program guidelines into 10-year cardiovascular risk score (10-y CVR) groups , and observed them until CVD event, death, last HIV Outpatient Study contact, or 30 September 2009. We calculated rates of incident CVD events and identified associated baseline risk factors using Cox proportional hazard models. We also performed a nested case-control study to examine the association of latest CD4(+) cell count with CVD events.RESULTS: Among 2005 patients, 148 experienced incident CVD events. CVD incidence increased steadily from 0.4 to 3.0 events per 100 person-years from lowest to highest 10-y CVR group (P < .001). In multivariable Cox analyses adjusted for 10-y CVR, CD4(+) cell count <350 cells/mm(3) was associated with incident CVD events (hazard ratio, 1.58 [95% confidence interval, 1.09-2.30], compared with >500 cells/mm(3)), suggesting an attributable risk of approximately 20%. In the multivariable case-control analyses, traditional CVD risk factors and latest CD4(+) cell count <500 cells/mm(3), but not cumulative use of ARV class or individual drugs, were associated with higher odds of experiencing CVD events.CONCLUSION: CD4(+) count <500 cells/mm(3) is an independent risk factor for incident CVD, comparable in attributable risk to several traditional CVD risk factors in the HIV Outpatient Study cohort.","['Adult', 'Ambulatory Care', 'CD4 Lymphocyte Count', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Female', 'HIV Infections', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Risk Factors', 'United States']",20597691,"[['M01.060.116'], ['E02.760.106', 'N02.421.585.106'], ['E01.370.225.500.195.107.595.500.150', 'E01.370.225.625.107.595.500.150', 'E05.200.500.195.107.595.500.150', 'E05.200.625.107.595.500.150', 'E05.242.195.107.595.500.150', 'G04.140.107.595.500.150', 'G09.188.105.595.500.150'], ['C14'], ['E05.318.372.500.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.500'], ['C01.221.250.875', 'C01.221.812.640.400', 'C01.778.640.400', 'C01.925.782.815.616.400', 'C01.925.813.400', 'C20.673.480'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E05.318.308.985.525.375', 'N01.224.935.597.500', 'N06.850.505.400.975.525.375', 'N06.850.520.308.985.525.375'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.500'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['E05.318.740.600.800.725', 'N05.715.350.200.700', 'N05.715.360.750.625.700.700', 'N06.850.490.625.750', 'N06.850.520.830.600.800.725'], ['Z01.107.567.875']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Geographicals [Z]']",0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1
Gas6 enhances axonal ensheathment by MBP+ membranous processes in human DRG/OL promyelinating co-cultures.,"The molecular requirements for human myelination are incompletely defined, and further study is needed to fully understand the cellular mechanisms involved during development and in demyelinating diseases. We have established a human co-culture model to study myelination. Our earlier observations showed that addition of human ã-carboxylated growth-arrest-specific protein 6 (Gas6) to human oligodendrocyte progenitor cell (OPC) cultures enhanced their survival and maturation. Therefore, we explored the effect of Gas6 in co-cultures of enriched OPCs plated on axons of human fetal dorsal root ganglia explant. Gas6 significantly enhanced the number of myelin basic protein-positive (MBP+) oligodendrocytes with membranous processes parallel with and ensheathing axons relative to co-cultures maintained in defined medium only for 14 days. Gas6 did not increase the overall number of MBP+ oligodendrocytes/culture; however, it significantly increased the length of MBP+ oligodendrocyte processes in contact with and wrapping axons. Multiple oligodendrocytes were in contact with a single axon, and several processes from one oligodendrocyte made contact with one or multiple axons. Electron microscopy supported confocal Z-series microscopy demonstrating axonal ensheathment by MBP+ oligodendrocyte membranous processes in Gas6-treated co-cultures. Contacts between the axonal and oligodendrocyte membranes were evident and multiple wraps of oligodendrocyte membrane around the axon were visible supporting a model system in which to study events in human myelination and aspects of non-compact myelin formation.","['Axons', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Ganglia, Spinal', 'Humans', 'In Situ Nick-End Labeling', 'Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Myelin Basic Protein', 'Myelin Sheath', 'Oligodendroglia']",24476104,"[['A08.675.542.145', 'A11.284.180.075', 'A11.671.137', 'A11.671.501.145'], ['E05.481.500.374'], ['E05.478.566.350.170', 'E05.478.566.380.360', 'E05.478.583.400.170', 'E05.601.470.350.170', 'E05.601.470.380.360'], ['E01.370.225.500.607.512.240', 'E01.370.225.750.551.512.240', 'E05.200.500.607.512.240', 'E05.200.750.551.512.240', 'E05.478.583.375'], ['A08.340.390.340', 'A08.800.350.340', 'A08.800.800.720.725.350'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E05.393.475'], ['D12.644.276', 'D12.776.467', 'D23.529'], ['E01.370.350.515.395', 'E05.595.395'], ['D12.776.543.620.540', 'D12.776.631.580.510'], ['A08.637.600.500', 'A08.637.800.500', 'A08.675.542.512.560', 'A08.800.800.690.500', 'A10.755.503', 'A11.284.149.165.600', 'A11.650.600.500', 'A11.650.800.500', 'A11.671.501.512.560', 'A11.671.514.553'], ['A08.637.600', 'A11.650.600']]","['Anatomy [A]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Advantages of QBI in TBSS analyses.,"Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWMRI) is used to study white matter (WM) in normal and clinical populations. In DWMRI studies, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) models the WM anisotropy with one dominant direction, detecting possible pathway abnormalities only in large and highly coherent fiber tracts. However, more general anisotropy models like Q-ball imaging (QBI) may provide more sensitive WM descriptors in single patients. The present study aimed to compare DTI and QBI models in a group-level population analysis, using Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) as a pathological case model of WM tract degeneration. DWMRI was performed in 19 ALS patients and 19 age and sex-matched healthy controls. DTI and QBI estimates were compared in whole-brain tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) and volume of interest (VOI) analyses, and correlated with ALS clinical scores of disability. A significant decrease of the QBI-derived generalized fractional anisotropy (GFA) was observed in both motor and extramotor fibers of ALS patients compared to controls. Homologue DTI-derived FA maps were only partially overlapping with GFA maps. Particularly, the left corticospinal tracts resulted more markedly depicted by the QBI than by the DTI model, with GFA predicting ALS disability better than FA. The present findings demonstrate that QBI model is suitable for studying WM tract degeneration in population-level clinical studies. Particularly, group-level studies of fiber integrity may benefit from QBI when DTI is biased towards low values, such as in cases of fiber degeneration, and in regions with more than one dominant fiber direction.","['Adult', 'Aged', 'Algorithms', 'Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis', 'Anisotropy', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Diffusion Tensor Imaging', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Image Processing, Computer-Assisted', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Models, Statistical', 'Nerve Fibers, Myelinated']",24211186,"[['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['G17.035', 'L01.224.050'], ['C10.228.854.139', 'C10.574.562.250', 'C10.574.950.050', 'C10.668.467.250', 'C18.452.845.800.050'], ['G01.590.040', 'G02.050'], ['A08.186.211'], ['E01.370.350.578.875.500', 'E01.370.376.537.625.500', 'E05.629.875.500'], ['E05.318.372.500.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.500'], ['E01.370.350.578.750', 'E01.370.350.825.500.150.500', 'E01.370.376.537.500', 'E05.629.750'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['L01.224.308'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['E05.318.740.500', 'E05.599.835', 'N05.715.360.750.530', 'N06.850.520.830.500'], ['A08.675.542.512', 'A11.671.501.512', 'A11.671.514']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]']",1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0
Thrombocytopenia and leukocytosis induced by single intravenous injections of cadmium-saturated metallothioneins-I and -II in rats.,"To comparably investigate hemotoxic potentials of CdCl2, cadmium-saturated metallothioneins-I (Cd-MT-I) and -II (Cd-MT-II), rats received single intravenous injections of one of those dissolved in saline with equivalent concentrations of Cd (0, 0.1, 0.3 and 1.0 mg Cd/kg body weight), and blood for hematological examinations was sampled at 1 and 5 days (Days 1 and 5) after the administrations. The counts of white blood cells showed dose-dependent increments in the 0.3 and 1.0 mg Cd/kg groups in Cd-MT-I and Cd-MT-II at Day 1, and returned to the normal levels at Day 5. The counts of platelets showed dose-dependent decrements in the three-doses groups of Cd-MT-I and Cd-MT-II at Day 1, and did a returning- and further increasing tendency at Day 5. The counts of red blood cells, values of hematocrit, hemoglobin, mean corpuscular volume, mean corpuscular hemoglobin and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration, showed only slight and sporadic changes at Days 1 and 5. As to that thrombocytopenia and leukocytosis were dose-dependently brought by Cd-MTs and not by CdCl2, and as to that CdCl2 and Cd-MTs hardly affected erythrocytes regarding their counts, sizes, hemoglobin contents etc., etiological mechanism (s) remains to be explored.

Reference data representative of normal findings at two-dimensional and three-dimensional gray-scale ultrasound examination of the cervix from 17 to 41 weeks' gestation.,"OBJECTIVES: To create reference values representative of normal findings on two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) transvaginal ultrasound (TVS) examination of the cervix from 17 to 41 weeks' gestation and to determine the agreement between cervical measurements taken by 2D and 3D TVS.METHODS: Cross-sectional study covering 17 to 41 weeks in 419 nulliparous and 360 parous women who delivered at term and who underwent 2D and 3D TVS examination of the uterine cervix. We examined approximately 25 women in each gestational week. The length, anteroposterior (AP) diameter and width of the cervix (and of any cervical funnel) and AP diameter of the cervical canal were measured. Results were plotted against gestational age. The agreement between 2D and 3D ultrasound results was expressed as the mean (+/- 2 SDs) difference between the results of the two methods and as the interclass correlation coefficient (inter-CC).RESULTS: There was excellent agreement between measurements taken by 2D and 3D ultrasound (inter-CC values, 0.80-0.98) but measurements of cervical length taken using 3D ultrasound were greater than measurements taken by 2D ultrasound (mean difference, -0.04 +/- 0.36 cm). Cervical length did not change substantially between 17 and 32 gestational weeks but decreased progressively thereafter. Cervical length was similar in nulliparous and parous women at 17-32 weeks, but from 33 weeks the cervix tended to be longer in parous women. In nulliparae, cervical length decreased from a median of 3.8 (range, 0.7-6.1) cm at 17-32 weeks to 2.3 (range, 0.4-6.0) cm at 33-40 weeks and to 0.7 (range, 0.2-1.5) cm at 41 weeks. In parous women, the corresponding figures were 3.9 (range, 1.0-6.1) cm, 3.0 (range, 0.4-5.7) cm and 0.8 (range, 0.4-3.4) cm (results obtained by 3D ultrasound). Cervical AP diameter and width did not differ between nulliparous and parous women. Median AP diameter increased from 3.0 (range, 2.0-4.6) cm at 17-30 weeks to 3.5 (range, 1.8-5.5) cm at 31-40 weeks and to 4.0 (range, 2.8-5.9) cm at 41 weeks. Cervical width was 3.7 (range, 2.3-6.0) cm at 17-30 weeks and 4.5 (range, 2.3-6.1) cm at 31-41 weeks. The percentage of women with funneling increased from 4% (3/84) at 17-18 weeks to 63% (12/19) at 41 weeks and the percentage of women with an open cervical canal increased from 19% (15/84) to 72% (13/19). Funneling and opening of the cervical canal were equally common in nulliparous and parous women.CONCLUSIONS: Reference data provide the basis for studies of pathological conditions. Common reference values for nulliparous and parous women can be used for cervical AP diameter and width from 17 to 41 weeks and for cervical length from 17 to 32 weeks. Separate reference values for cervical length for nulliparous and parous women should be used from 33 to 41 weeks.","['Adult', 'Cervix Uteri', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Female', 'Gestational Age', 'Humans', 'Imaging, Three-Dimensional', 'Parity', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Trimester, Second', 'Pregnancy Trimester, Third', 'Reference Values', 'Statistics, Nonparametric', 'Ultrasonography, Prenatal']",16388513,"[['M01.060.116'], ['A05.360.319.679.256'], ['E05.318.372.500.875', 'N05.715.360.330.500.875', 'N06.850.520.450.500.875'], ['G07.345.500.325.235.968', 'G08.686.320'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E01.370.350.400', 'L01.224.308.410'], ['G08.686.677', 'G08.686.784.769.472', 'N06.850.490.812.600'], ['G08.686.784.769'], ['G08.686.707.490'], ['G08.686.707.520'], ['E05.978.810'], ['E05.318.740.995', 'N05.715.360.750.760', 'N06.850.520.830.995'], ['E01.370.350.850.865', 'E01.370.378.630.865']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Information Science [L]']",1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0
Collection and cryopreservation of preimplantation embryos of Cavia porcellus.,"Individual differences and a rather long-lasting reproductive cycle, as well as the relatively small number of oocytes that mature during one reproductive cycle makes it difficult to establish a cryopreserved stock of preimplantation embryos of the guineapig (Cavia porcellus) when compared with other laboratory rodents. Only a few data for superovulation protocols that can be used for routine laboratory use in guineapigs are available. However, a huge number of different strains exist for many purposes and the establishment of a frozen repository makes sense. Here, we describe the successful freezing of preimplatation embryos of the strain 2BS with a two-step freezing protocol in a freezing medium containing 1,2-propanediol as cryoprotectant.

Executive function impairment in early-treated PKU subjects with normal mental development.,"Executive functions were studied in 14 early and continuously treated PKU subjects (age 10.8 years, range 8-13) in comparison with controls matched for IQ, sex, age and socioeconomic status. Brain MRI examination was normal in all PKU patients. Neuropsychological evaluation included Wisconsin Card Sorting Test, Rey-Osterreith Complex Figure Test, Elithorn's Perceptual Maze Test, Weigl's Sorting Test, Tower of London, Visual Search and Motor Motor Learning Test. Whatever the IQ, PKU subjects performed worse than controls in tests exploring executive functions. Subgrouping the PKU subjects according to the quality of dietary control for the entire follow-up period (using 400 micromol/L as cut-off value for blood phenylalanine (Phe) concentration) showed that patients with worse dietary control performed more poorly than both the PKU group with the best dietary control and the control group. However, a mild impairment of executive functions was still found in PKU patients with a good dietary control (Phe <400 micromol/L) compared to controls. Concerning the PKU group as a whole, no linear correlation was found between neuropsychological performance and historical and concurrent biochemical parameters. We conclude that (a) PKU patients, even when treated early, rigorously and continuously, show an impairment of frontal lobe functions; (b) a protracted exposure to moderately high levels of Phe can affect frontal lobe functions independently of the possible effect of the same exposure on IQ; (c) in order to reduce the risk of frontal lobe dysfunction, the target of dietary therapy should be to maintain blood Phe concentration below 400 micromol/L.","['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Cognition Disorders', 'Female', 'Frontal Lobe', 'Humans', 'Intelligence', 'Male', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'Phenylketonurias', 'Prognosis', 'Social Class']",15159642,"[['M01.060.057'], ['M01.060.406'], ['F03.615.250'], ['A08.186.211.200.885.287.500.270'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['F01.752.543'], ['F04.711.513'], ['C10.228.140.163.100.687', 'C16.320.565.100.766', 'C16.320.565.189.687', 'C18.452.132.100.687', 'C18.452.648.100.766', 'C18.452.648.189.687'], ['E01.789'], ['I01.880.853.996.755', 'N01.824.782']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Health Care [N]']",1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0

Application of fed-batch fermentation to the preparation of isotopically labeled or selenomethionyl-labeled proteins.,"An increasing demand for isotopically labeled samples for spectroscopic and crystallographic studies has led to a corresponding need for effective and efficient methods for producing these samples. The present work is based on the strategy of using an isotopically labeled compound as the growth-limiting nutrient during protein expression in Escherichia coli (DE3) strains. By using dissolved O2 and agitation rate data, the cell growth, feeding of the isotopic label, induction of protein expression, and the harvest of cells can be coordinated in a feedback controlled fermenter in a simple, easily defined manner. This approach is demonstrated for the nutrient-limited production of [U-15N]- and [U-13C, U-15N]-labeled toluene 4-monooxygenase effector protein in E. coli BL21(DE3) with isotopic abundance identical to that of the labeled precursors. For selective labeling, demonstrated with selenomethionine using methionine auxotroph E. coli B834(DE3), approximately 80-85% incorporation was obtained from methionine-dependent growth of the auxotroph followed by selenomethionine feeding and protein induction upon methionine depletion. This selective labeling is accomplished in a single culture, does not require washing or resuspension, minimizes costly incorporation of label into host cell mass prior to induction, and can be easily adapted to selective labeling with other amino acids. Moreover, cell mass yield from these experiments can be readily optimized to provide the desired level of protein for a given investigation from a single growth and purification. This combination provides an efficient, controllable option for isotopic labeling experiments.","['Base Sequence', 'Carbon Isotopes', 'DNA Primers', 'Escherichia coli', 'Fermentation', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes, Bacterial', 'Nitrogen Isotopes', 'Oxygenases', 'Pseudomonas', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Selenomethionine']",10336868,"[['G02.111.570.080', 'G05.360.080', 'L01.453.245.667.080'], ['D01.268.150.075', 'D01.496.123'], ['D13.695.578.424.450.275', 'D27.720.470.530.600.223.600'], ['B03.440.450.425.325.300', 'B03.660.250.150.180.100'], ['G02.111.158.249', 'G03.191.249'], ['G05.297'], ['G05.360.340.024.340.364.249', 'G05.360.340.358.024.249', 'G05.360.340.358.207.249'], ['D01.268.604.500', 'D01.362.625.500', 'D01.496.586'], ['D08.811.682.690'], ['B03.440.400.425.625.625', 'B03.660.250.580.590'], ['D12.776.828'], ['D02.731.700', 'D02.886.030.676.900', 'D12.125.166.676.900']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]']",0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
Expressed emotion in depressed patients and their partners.,"This study was designed to assess the expressed emotion (EE) status in the spouses of depressed patients and the patients themselves, to relate the EE status to the severity of depression as measured by the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), and to compare the prevalence of high EE between the target and control group. Seventeen depressed patients and their spouses, and 20 control couples participated in the study. The Five-Minute Speech Sample was used to assess the EE status. High EE was significantly more common in spouses of depressed patients and the patients themselves than in controls. There was a significant relationship between the EE status of the patients and their spouses. High EE in the patient and in the spouse corresponded significantly with a high BDI score of the patient.

Epidemiology of neural tube defects.,"OBJECTIVE: To find the prevalence of neural tube defects (NTDs), and compare the findings with local and international data, and highlight the important role of folic acid supplementation and flour fortification with folic acid in preventing NTDs.METHODS: This is a retrospective study of data retrieved from the medical records of live newborn infants admitted to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU), Security Forces Hospital (SFH), Riyadh, Saudi Arabia with NTDs spanning 14 years (1996-2009). All pregnant women on their first antenatal visit to the primary care clinic were prescribed folic acid 0.5 mg daily, or 5 mg if there is a family history of NTD. The pre-fortification prevalence is compared to post-fortification, before and after excluding syndromic, genetic, and chromosomal causes. The results were compared with reports from other parts of Saudi Arabia and internationally, through a literature search using MEDLINE.RESULTS: The prevalence of NTDs during the period was 1.2 per 1000 live births. The pre-fortification of flour with folic acid prevalence was 1.46 per 1000 live births. The post-fortification prevalence was 1.05 (p=0.103). After excluding syndromic, genetic, and chromosomal causes from calculation of the prevalence, there was a significant reduction in the prevalence, from 1.46 to 0.81 per 1000 live births (p=0.0088). Syndromic, genetic, and chromosomal causes were identified in 20 cases (19.4%). Only 2% of mothers received preconception folic acid, and only 10% of them received it during the first 4 weeks of gestation.CONCLUSION: Despite the implementation of fortification of flour with folic acid since 2001, the prevalence of NTDs in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is still high. This is due to the impact of genetic, syndromic, and chromosomal causes of NTD not preventable by folic acid. Other factors like unplanned pregnancy and lack of awareness of the role of folic acid in preventing nonsyndromic causes, play a significant role.","['Folic Acid', 'Food, Fortified', 'Humans', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Neural Tube Defects', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Saudi Arabia']",25551108,"[['D03.633.100.733.631.400'], ['G07.203.300.515', 'J02.500.515'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.703.520'], ['C10.500.680', 'C16.131.666.680'], ['E05.318.372.500.500.500', 'E05.318.372.500.750.750', 'N05.715.360.330.500.500.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.825', 'N06.850.520.450.500.500.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.825'], ['Z01.252.245.500.750']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Geographicals [Z]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,1

In the present study, physiological data on cellular properties of 2°VNs of the grass frog (Rana temporaria) have been used to construct conductance-based spiking cellular models that were fine-tuned by fitting to recorded spike-frequency data. The results of this approach suggest that low-threshold, voltage-dependent potassium channels in phasic and spike-dependent potassium channels in tonic 2°VNs are important contributors to the differential, yet complementary response characteristics of the two vestibular subtypes. Extension of the cellular model with conductance-based synapses allowed simulation of afferent excitation and evaluation of the emerging properties of local feedforward inhibitory circuits. This approach revealed the relative contributions of intrinsic and synaptic factors on afferent signal processing in phasic 2°VNs. Additional extension of the single-cell model to a population model allowed testing under more natural conditions including asynchronous afferent labyrinthine input and synaptic noise. This latter approach indicated that the feedforward inhibition from the local inhibitory network acts as a high-pass filter, which reinforces the impact of the intrinsic membrane properties of phasic 2°VNs on peak response amplitude and timing. Thus, the combination of cellular and network properties enables phasic 2°VNs to work as a noise-resistant detector, suitable for central processing of short-duration vestibular signals.","['Animals', 'Electrophysiology', 'Female', 'Head Movements', 'Male', 'Neural Inhibition', 'Neurons', 'Potassium Channels, Voltage-Gated', 'Rana temporaria', 'Signal Transduction', 'Synapses', 'Vestibule, Labyrinth']",21653841,"[['B01.050'], ['H01.158.344.528', 'H01.158.782.236'], ['G11.427.410.478'], ['G07.265.755', 'G11.561.616'], ['A08.675', 'A11.671'], ['D12.776.157.530.400.600.900', 'D12.776.543.550.450.750.900', 'D12.776.543.585.400.750.900'], ['B01.050.150.900.090.180.708.420'], ['G02.111.820', 'G04.835'], ['A08.850', 'A11.284.149.165.420.780'], ['A09.246.300.909']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]']",1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
An audit of emergency echocardiography in a district general hospital.,"Eighty patients (43 M, 37 F), aged 23-89 years who were referred for emergency echocardiography over a 12-month period were prospectively studied in order to determine the reasons for emergency echocardiography and the influence of its results on patient management. The most frequent emergency request was to clarify whether the basis for cardiomegaly in a haemodynamically unstable patient was pericardial effusion or left ventricular dilatation. Other reasons for requests were for assessment for source of systemic emboli, acute complications of myocardial infarction, endocarditis, valve dysfunction and cardiac trauma. As a consequence of the emergency echocardiography, management was immediately influenced in 19 patients. This study has provided information on the specific settings in which emergency echocardiography can be justified.","['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Echocardiography', 'Emergencies', 'Female', 'Heart Diseases', 'Hospitals, District', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prospective Studies', 'Utilization Review', 'Ventricular Function, Left']",8225674,"[['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['M01.060.116.100.080'], ['E01.370.350.130.750', 'E01.370.350.850.220', 'E01.370.370.380.220'], ['C23.550.291.781', 'N06.230.100.083', 'N06.850.376'], ['C14.280'], ['N02.278.421.510.140'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.625', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.650', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.650'], ['N04.761.879', 'N05.700.900'], ['G09.330.955.800']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
Design of a full-dynamic-range balanced detection heterodyne gyroscope with common-path configuration.,"In this article, we propose an optical heterodyne common-path gyroscope which has common-path configuration and full-dynamic range. Different from traditional non-common-path optical heterodyne technique such as Mach-Zehnder or Michelson interferometers, we use a two-frequency laser light source (TFLS) which can generate two orthogonally polarized light with a beat frequency has a common-path configuration. By use of phase measurement, this optical heterodyne gyroscope not only has the capability to overcome the drawback of the traditional interferometric fiber optic gyro: lack for full-dynamic range, but also eliminate the total polarization rotation caused by SMFs. Moreover, we also demonstrate the potential of miniaturizing this gyroscope as a chip device. Theoretically, if we assume that the wavelength of the laser light is 1550nm, the SMFs are 250m in length, and the radius of the fiber ring is 3.5cm, the bias stability is 0.872 deg/hr.","['Acceleration', 'Equipment Design', 'Equipment Failure Analysis', 'Interferometry', 'Transducers']",23609700,"[['G01.482.107'], ['E05.320'], ['E05.325.192'], ['E05.490'], ['E07.305.812']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Hyperthermia and low dose-rate irradiation.,"Hyperthermia combined with 60Co gamma irradiation was studied using V79 hamster cells cultured in vitro. Modest hyperthermia (41 degrees C for 6 hrs.) enhanced the cell killing produced by acute exposure to radiation. The same treatment enhanced the effect of low dose-rate irradiation (200 rads/hr.) even more. The sequence in which modest hyperthermia was combined with low dose-rate irradiation was important. Maximal enhancement was observed when hyperthermia was followed by irradiations. The probable explanation is that, by damaging the repair system, prior heat renders the cells unable to repair sublethal damage during subsequent low dose-rate irradiation.","['Animals', 'Cell Survival', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cobalt Radioisotopes', 'Cricetinae', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Hot Temperature', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Radiation Tolerance', 'Radioisotope Teletherapy']",693874,"[['B01.050'], ['G04.346'], ['A11.251'], ['D01.268.556.185.500.354', 'D01.268.956.155.500.354', 'D01.496.239.354', 'D01.496.749.256', 'D01.552.544.185.500.354'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.075.250'], ['E05.799.513.500', 'G01.750.740.500', 'G04.712.500', 'G07.225', 'G07.738.500', 'N06.850.810.250.180'], ['G01.906.595.543', 'G16.500.275.063.725.710.380', 'G16.500.750.775.710.380', 'N06.230.300.100.725.232', 'N06.230.300.100.725.710.380'], ['E05.481'], ['G04.712', 'G07.738'], ['E02.815.722.820']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
The current status and effects of emergency drug shortages in China: Perceptions of emergency department physicians.,"OBJECTIVES: The shortage of emergency drugs in China is severe. This study aimed to characterize emergency drug shortages in China and to measure their effects.METHODS: An online questionnaire based on a literature review was sent to emergency department physicians in Chinese secondary and tertiary hospitals from November 2016 to February 2017. The survey asked physicians questions about their experiences with emergency drug shortages.RESULTS: In total, 236 physicians from 29 provinces participated in the survey. According to their responses, 90.7% of the respondents experienced drug shortages during the last year. More than half of the physicians (65.7%) reported that drug shortages occurred at least once a month. Hospitals in the eastern and western regions of China had more emergency drugs in shortage than hospitals in central China, especially those with many inpatient beds (?800). In addition, the shortage situation was more serious in secondary hospitals than in tertiary hospitals. More respondents agreed that original medicines, injections, essential medicines, medicines without alternative agents and cheap medicines were more susceptible to shortages than generics, oral medicines, nonessential medicines, medicines with alternative agents and expensive medicines, respectively. Most respondents thought that drug shortages always, often or sometimes affected patients [delayed therapy (62.6%), longer rescue and recovery times (58.9%) and higher costs (58.7%)] and physicians [inconvenience (81.0%), higher pressure (76.5%) and harm to patient-doctor relationships (72%)] and compromised hospital reputations (55.1%).CONCLUSIONS: The shortage of emergency drugs in China is serious, especially in secondary hospitals located in eastern and western China. Emergency drug shortages have significant effects on patients and physicians.","['China', 'Drugs, Essential', 'Drugs, Generic', 'Emergency Service, Hospital', 'Health Care Surveys', 'Health Services Needs and Demand', 'Humans', 'Physicians', 'Secondary Care Centers']",30300412,"[['Z01.252.474.164'], ['D26.355'], ['D26.360'], ['N02.278.216.500.968.336', 'N02.421.297.195', 'N04.452.442.452.422.336'], ['E05.318.308.980.344', 'N03.349.380.210', 'N05.425.210', 'N05.715.360.300.800.344', 'N06.850.520.308.980.344'], ['N03.349.380.420', 'N05.300.450'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.526.485.810', 'N02.360.810'], ['N02.278.421.745']]","['Geographicals [Z]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Named Groups [M]']",0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1

A model of the control system with the standard which functions in two modes of operations is treated. The first mode is distinguished by measured control signal leaps used for the identification of a system state and for a further movement correction and precise definition of active muscle composition. The second mode is characterized by the estimation of movement direction only, in case when a certain value of a regulated parameter is maintained or reached.

Membrane damage and incorporation of Escherichia coli components into Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus.,"Cytoplasmic membrane of E. coli is degraded within 20 min following infection with Bdellovibrio. 50% of cellular 42-K is lost during the first 10 min. The cytoplasmic membrane, 20 min after infection, centrifugated on a sucrose gradient produces a wide band containing the main enzyme activities (succinic dehydrogenase and lactic dehydrogenase) bound to the membrane. The incorporation into Bdellovibrio of labelled host cell constituents during intracellular growth has been studied at successive intervals during the development cycle in diluted nutrient broth (about 3 hrs). The cells were broken in a Sorvall-Ribi cell fractionator and the Bdellovibrios separated by centrifugation on sucrose gradient. Polysaccharides, proteins and lipids of Bdellovibrio derive from the utilization of components of the host cells and not from the utilization of the components present in the medium. The incorporation of precursors into polysaccharides and proteins shows the same exponential pattern.","['Acetates', 'Bacterial Proteins', 'Bacteriolysis', 'Cell Fractionation', 'Cell Membrane', 'Escherichia coli', 'Glucose', 'L-Lactate Dehydrogenase', 'Leucine', 'Polysaccharides, Bacterial', 'Potassium', 'Spheroplasts', 'Spirillum', 'Succinate Dehydrogenase']",1096504,"[['D02.241.081.018', 'D10.251.400.045'], ['D12.776.097'], ['G06.099.115'], ['E05.242.251'], ['A11.284.149'], ['B03.440.450.425.325.300', 'B03.660.250.150.180.100'], ['D09.947.875.359.448'], ['D08.811.682.047.551.400', 'D08.811.682.047.820.493'], ['D12.125.070.637', 'D12.125.142.441'], ['D09.698.718', 'D23.050.161.616'], ['D01.268.549.550', 'D01.268.557.575', 'D01.552.528.652', 'D01.552.547.650'], ['A11.868', 'B03.110.761', 'B05.110.761'], ['B03.440.840.750', 'B03.660.075.710.750'], ['D05.500.562.750.249.500', 'D08.811.600.250.500.750.500', 'D08.811.600.250.875.249.500', 'D08.811.682.660.385.500', 'D08.811.682.830.249.500', 'D12.776.157.427.374.375.909.500', 'D12.776.331.199.750.500', 'D12.776.543.277.500.750.500', 'D12.776.543.277.875.249.500', 'D12.776.556.579.374.375.141.500']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Organisms [B]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
George Miller's magical number of immediate memory in retrospect: Observations on the faltering progression of science.,"Miller's (1956) article about storage capacity limits, ""The Magical Number Seven Plus or Minus Two . . .,"" is one of the best-known articles in psychology. Though influential in several ways, for about 40 years it was oddly followed by rather little research on the numerical limit of capacity in working memory, or on the relation between 3 potentially related phenomena that Miller described. Given that the article was written in a humorous tone and was framed around a tongue-in-cheek premise (persecution by an integer), I argue that it may have inadvertently stymied progress on these topics as researchers attempted to avoid ridicule. This commentary relates some correspondence with Miller on his article and concludes with a call to avoid self-censorship of our less conventional ideas.

Acetaldehyde accumulation in rat mammary tissue after an acute treatment with alcohol.,"Previous studies reported the presence in rat mammary tissue of a cytosolic xanthine oxidoreductase pathway for the metabolism of alcohol to acetaldehyde and hydroxyl radicals and to the microsomal biotransformation of ethanol to acetaldehyde. It was also reported that after chronic ethanol drinking stressful oxidative conditions can be observed. The present work reports that even after single doses of ethanol, given at three different levels (6.3 g kg(-1); 3.8 g kg(-1) or 0.6 g kg(-1) p.o.), acetaldehyde accumulates for prolonged periods of time in the mammary tissue to reach concentrations higher than in blood (e.g. 5.1+/-1.2 nmol g(-1) versus 0.2+/-0.1 nmol ml(-1), for 6.3 g kg(-1) dose, 6 h after intoxication). The presence in rat mammary tissue of low activities of additional enzymes able to generate acetaldehyde was established (alcohol dehydrogenase: 0.97+/-0.84 mU mg(-1) protein; CYP2E1: 1.30+/-0.12 x 10(-2) pmol 4-nitrocatechol min(-1) mg(-1) protein) and a low activity of aldehyde dehydrogenase was observed in the cytosolic, mitochondrial and microsomal fractions (0.02+/-0.04; 0.35+/-0.09 and 0.72+/-0.19 mU mg(-1) protein, respectively). After a single high dose of ethanol, an increased susceptibility to oxidative stress was observed, as evidenced by changes in the shape of t-butylhydroperoxide induced emission of chemiluminescence in mammary tissue (6.3 g kg(-1) dose; at 3 and 6 h). In summary, the results show that even after single doses of ethanol, acetaldehyde, either formed in situ or arriving via blood, tends to accumulate in mammary tissue and that this condition might decrease cell defenses against injury.","['Acetaldehyde', 'Alcohol Dehydrogenase', 'Aldehyde Dehydrogenase', 'Animals', 'Central Nervous System Depressants', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2E1', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Ethanol', 'Female', 'Luminescent Measurements', 'Mammary Glands, Animal', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Rats', 'Subcellular Fractions']",17590863,"[['D02.047.064'], ['D08.811.682.047.820.250'], ['D08.811.682.657.163.249'], ['B01.050'], ['D27.505.696.277', 'D27.505.954.427.210'], ['D08.244.453.491.375', 'D08.811.682.662.582.338', 'D08.811.682.690.708.170.450.375', 'D12.776.422.220.453.491.375'], ['G07.690.773.875', 'G07.690.936.500'], ['D02.033.375'], ['E05.196.712.516'], ['A10.336.482', 'A13.589'], ['G03.673', 'G07.775.750'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700'], ['A11.284.835']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Comparison of thulium laser enucleation and plasmakinetic resection of the prostate in a randomized prospective trial with 5-year follow-up.,"The aim of this study was to compare the clinical outcomes between thulium laser enucleation of the prostate (ThuLEP) and plasmakinetic bipolar resection of the prostate (PKRP) for treating benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) in a prospective randomized trial with 5 years of follow-up. One hundred fifty-eight consecutive patients with BPH were randomized to receive operation of either ThuLEP (n = 79) or PKRP (n = 79). All cases were evaluated preoperatively, and a part of them were evaluated at 3-5 years postoperatively by the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), quality of life score (QoLS), maximum flow rate (Q max), and postvoid residual (PVR) urine volume. Eighty patients completed the 5-year follow-up. Each study arm showed no significant difference in preoperative parameters. Compared with PKRP, ThuLEP required longer operation time (65.4 vs 47.4 min, p = 0.022) but resulted in less hemoglobin decrease (1.5 vs 3.0 g/L, p = 0.045), catheterization time (2.1 vs 3.5 days, p = 0.031), irrigated volume (12.4 vs 27.2 L, p = 0.022), and hospital stay (2.5 vs 4.6 days, p = 0.026). During the 60-month follow-up, both procedures demonstrated no significant difference in terms of Q max, IPSS, PVR urine volume, and QoLS. ThuLEP was statistically superior to PKRP in blood loss, catheterization time, irrigated volume, and hospital stay but inferior to PKRP in operation time. However, both procedures showed no significant difference in terms of Q max, IPSS, PVR urine volume, and QoLS through the 60-month follow-up.","['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Humans', 'Laser Therapy', 'Length of Stay', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Operative Time', 'Prospective Studies', 'Prostatic Hyperplasia', 'Quality of Life', 'Thulium']",27677474,"[['M01.060.116.100'], ['M01.060.116.100.080'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E02.594', 'E04.014.520'], ['E02.760.400.480', 'N02.421.585.400.480'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['E04.614.374.500', 'N02.421.585.753.374.500'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.625', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.650', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.650'], ['C12.294.565.500'], ['I01.800', 'K01.752.400.750', 'N06.850.505.400.425.837'], ['D01.268.558.362.984', 'D01.552.550.399.984']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Humanities [K]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0
Electrochemical anodization of graphite oxide-TiO2,"The electrochemical anodization method was used to dope graphite oxide (GO) onto TiO2 nanotubes (TNTs). This study focused on enhancement of the photocatalytic activity of TNTs in the visible light region. In this study, we have checked the effect of different GO concentrations and effect of GO doping time on photocatalytic efficiency of composite. The photocatalytic activity of the GO-TNT composite was tested by degradation of an organic compound. The organic compound was most severely degraded (95%) when the GO-TNT catalyst was doped at an anodization of 60 V for 13 min and GO concentration of 0.25 g L-1. This degradation was 5.6 times higher than that of bare TiO2. The as-prepared catalyst was characterized using FE-SEM, XRD, AES, PL, UV-Vis DRS, and Raman analysis. Recycling of the GO-TNT composite was also performed in order to examine the stability of the visible light catalyst. We observed that the doping of GO on the TNT surface can enhance the photocatalytic efficiency under visible light. Graphene acts as an electron transport; therefore, GO-TNTs were favorable for the separation of e- and h+ charges.

Phantom calibration method for improved temporal characterization of hemodynamic response in event-related fMRI.,"In event-related functional MRI, there exist limits on the time length of the experiments on human subjects and the imaging speed. Due to these limitations, data truncation and undersampling have to be used in functional MRI signal acquisition. The effect of these factors on the hemodynamic deconvolution is investigated experimentally and a phantom calibration method to improve the hemodynamic response is developed. It is observed that the high frequency components generated due to data truncation can fold back into low frequencies when the sampling rate is not sufficiently high. This aliasing can introduce significant noise in hemodynamic deconvolution and can reduce the accuracy of the temporal characterization of hemodynamic response. A SMARTPHANTOM BOLD simulator is used to calibrate the aliasing effect in an event-related functional MRI experiment. With the calibration, an anti-aliasing method is used to suppress the aliasing and this resulted in an improved temporal characterization of hemodynamic response in event-related fMRI.","['Brain', 'Calibration', 'Humans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Oxygen', 'Phantoms, Imaging', 'Time Factors']",17291783,"[['A08.186.211'], ['E05.978.155'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E01.370.350.825.500'], ['D01.268.185.550', 'D01.362.670'], ['E07.671'], ['G01.910.857']]","['Anatomy [A]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
The assimilation of evidence-based healthcare innovations: a management-based perspective.,"In order to reap the benefits of the nation's vast investments in healthcare discoveries, evidence-based healthcare innovations (EBHI) must be assimilated by the organizations that adopt them. Data from a naturalistic field study are used to test a management-based model of implementation success which hypothesizes strategic fit, climate for EBHI implementation, and fidelity will explain variability in the assimilation of EBHIs by organizations that adopted them under ordinary circumstances approximately 6 years earlier. Data gathered from top managers and external consultants directly involved with these long-term EBHI implementation efforts provide preliminary support for predicted positive linkages between strategic fit and climate; climate and fidelity; and fidelity and assimilation. Mediated regression analyses also suggest that climate and fidelity may be important mediators. Findings raise important questions about the meaning of assimilation, top managers' roles as agents of assimilation, and the extent to which results represent real-world versus implicit models of assimilation.","['Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Delivery of Health Care', 'Diffusion of Innovation', 'Evidence-Based Practice', 'Health Facility Administration', 'Humans', 'Models, Organizational', 'Organizational Culture', 'Organizational Policy', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Regression Analysis', 'Reproducibility of Results']",23138666,"[['E05.318.372.500.875', 'N05.715.360.330.500.875', 'N06.850.520.450.500.875'], ['N04.590.374', 'N05.300'], ['L01.143.320'], ['H02.249'], ['N02.278.216', 'N04.452.442'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E05.599.670', 'N04.452.534'], ['N04.452.606'], ['I01.655.500.550', 'I01.880.604.825.550', 'N03.623.500.550'], ['E05.318.370.800.650', 'N05.715.360.325.700.640', 'N06.850.520.445.800.650'], ['E05.318.740.750', 'N05.715.360.750.695', 'N06.850.520.830.750'], ['E05.318.370.725', 'E05.337.851', 'N05.715.360.325.685', 'N06.850.520.445.725']]","['Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]']",0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0
Effects of repeated amphetamine treatment on the locomotor activity of the dopamine D1A-deficient mouse.,"The role of dopamine D1A receptors in mediating amphetamine-induced sensitization was investigated using the D1A-deficient mouse. During the drug pre-exposure phase, D1A-deficient and control mice were injected for five consecutive days with saline or amphetamine (2 mg/kg, i.p.). Locomotor activity was measured on the first and fifth pre-exposure day. After three abstinence days, mice were given either amphetamine or saline and locomotor activity was again assessed. Mice were then sacrificed and protein kinase A (PKA) activity was measured. In contrast to control mice, D1A-deficient mice did not show a progressive increase in locomotor activity across days. Importantly, both control and mutant mice did exhibit behavioral sensitization, because mice pre-exposed and tested with amphetamine were more active than mice acutely tested with the drug. Even so, the amphetamine-induced locomotor activity of the mutant mice was significantly reduced when compared with similarly treated control mice, indicating that the sensitized response was less pronounced in the D1A-deficient mouse. PKA activity also varied depending on genotype, since amphetamine decreased PKA activity in control but not D1A-deficient mice.","['8-Bromo Cyclic Adenosine Monophosphate', 'Adenosine Triphosphate', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Animals', 'Caudate Nucleus', 'Corpus Striatum', 'Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases', 'Dextroamphetamine', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Homozygote', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Motor Activity', 'Nucleus Accumbens', 'Phosphorylation', 'Putamen', 'Receptors, Dopamine D1', 'Recombination, Genetic', 'Time Factors']",9261820,"[['D03.633.100.759.646.138.395.225', 'D13.695.462.200.225', 'D13.695.667.138.395.225', 'D13.695.827.068.395.225'], ['D03.633.100.759.646.138.236', 'D13.695.667.138.236', 'D13.695.827.068.236'], ['E05.318.740.150', 'N05.715.360.750.125', 'N06.850.520.830.150'], ['B01.050'], ['A08.186.211.200.885.287.249.487.550.184'], ['A08.186.211.200.885.287.249.487'], ['D08.811.913.696.620.682.700.150.125', 'D12.644.360.200.125', 'D12.776.476.200.125'], ['D02.092.471.683.152.110.200'], ['E02.319.283'], ['G05.380.554'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500'], ['B01.050.050.136.500.500', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500.550.455', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500.800.500'], ['F01.145.632', 'G11.427.410.698'], ['A08.186.211.200.885.287.249.487.775.500'], ['G02.111.665', 'G02.607.780', 'G03.796'], ['A08.186.211.200.885.287.249.487.550.784'], ['D12.776.543.750.670.300.400.400', 'D12.776.543.750.695.150.400.400', 'D12.776.543.750.720.330.400.400'], ['G05.728'], ['G01.910.857']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]']",1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
Functional organization of face processing in the human superior temporal sulcus: a 7T high-resolution fMRI study.,"The superior temporal sulcus (STS) is a major component of the human face perception network, implicated in processing dynamic changeable aspects of faces. However, it remains unknown whether STS holds functionally segregated subdivisions for different categories of facial movements. We used high-resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) at 7T in 16 volunteers to compare STS activation with faces displaying angry or happy expressions, eye-gaze shifts and lip-speech movements. Combining univariate and multivariate analyses, we show a systematic topological organization within STS, with gaze-related activity predominating in the most posterior and superior sector, speech-related activity in the anterior sector and emotional expressions represented in the intermediate middle STS. Right STS appeared to hold a finer functional segregation between all four types of facial movements, and best discriminative abilities within the face-selective posterior STS (pSTS). Conversely, left STS showed greater overlap between conditions, with a lack of distinction between mouth movements associated to speech or happy expression and better discriminative abilities (for gaze and speech vs emotion conditions) outside pSTS. Differential sensitivity to upper (eye) or lower (mouth) facial features may contribute to, but does not appear to fully account for, these response patterns.","['Adult', 'Brain Mapping', 'Discrimination, Psychological', 'Emotions', 'Evoked Potentials', 'Eye Movements', 'Facial Expression', 'Facial Recognition', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Male', 'Speech', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Young Adult']",29140527,"[['M01.060.116'], ['E01.370.350.578.875.500', 'E01.370.376.537.625.500', 'E05.629.875.500'], ['F02.463.593.257'], ['F01.470'], ['G07.265.216.500', 'G11.561.200.500'], ['G11.427.410.140', 'G14.350'], ['E01.370.600.225', 'F01.145.209.530.385'], ['F02.463.593.524.250.500', 'F02.463.593.524.500.500', 'F02.463.593.932.622.500'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E01.370.350.825.500'], ['F01.145.209.908.677', 'G11.561.812', 'L01.559.423.676'], ['A08.186.211.200.885.287.500.863'], ['M01.060.116.815']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0
Screening Mammography Utilization and Medicare Beneficiaries' Perceptions of Their Primary Care Physicians.,"RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: To assess associations between screening mammography utilization and Medicare beneficiaries' relationships with, and impressions of, their primary care physicians.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using the Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey Access to Care Public Use File, we retrospectively studied responses from a national random cross section of Medicare beneficiaries surveyed in 2013 regarding perceptions of their primary care physicians and their screening mammography utilization. Statistical analysis accounted for subject weighting factors to estimate national screening utilization.RESULTS: Among 7492 female Medicare beneficiaries, 62.0% (95% confidence interval 59.8%-64.2%) underwent screening mammography. Utilization was higher for beneficiaries having (vs. not) a regular medical practice or clinic (63.2% vs. 34.6%) and a usual physician (63.8% vs. 50.3%). Utilization was higher for beneficiaries very satisfied (vs. very dissatisfied) with the overall quality of care they received (66.0% vs. 35.8%), their ease of getting to a doctor (67.7% vs. 43.2%), and their physician's concerns for their health (65.7% vs. 53.4%), as well as for beneficiaries strongly agreeing (vs. strongly disagreeing) that their physician is competent (66.0% vs. 54.1%), understands what is wrong (66.3% vs. 47.1%), answers all questions (67.0% vs. 46.7%), and fosters confidence (66.0% vs. 50.6%). Independent predictors of screening mammography utilization (P < .05) were satisfaction with quality of care, having a regular practice or clinic, and satisfaction with ease of getting to their physician.CONCLUSIONS: Screening mammography utilization is higher among Medicare beneficiaries with established primary physician relationships, particularly when those relationships are favorable. To optimize screening mammography utilization, breast imagers are encouraged to support initiatives to enhance high-quality primary care relationships.","['Clinical Competence', 'Early Detection of Cancer', 'Empathy', 'Female', 'Health Care Surveys', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Humans', 'Mammography', 'Medicare', 'Patient Satisfaction', 'Perception', 'Physician-Patient Relations', 'Primary Health Care', 'Quality of Health Care', 'Retrospective Studies', 'United States']",29199056,"[['I02.399.630.210', 'N04.761.210', 'N05.715.175'], ['E01.390.500'], ['F01.752.355', 'F01.752.543.500.500'], ['E05.318.308.980.344', 'N03.349.380.210', 'N05.425.210', 'N05.715.360.300.800.344', 'N06.850.520.308.980.344'], ['N04.590.374.350', 'N05.300.430'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E01.370.350.700.500'], ['N03.219.521.346.506.564.663', 'N03.219.521.576.343.840', 'N03.706.615.696'], ['F01.100.150.750.625', 'F01.145.488.887.625', 'N04.452.822.700', 'N05.300.150.800.625', 'N05.715.360.600'], ['F02.463.593'], ['F01.829.401.650.675', 'N05.300.660.625'], ['N04.590.233.727'], ['N04.761', 'N05.715'], ['E05.318.372.500.500.500', 'E05.318.372.500.750.750', 'N05.715.360.330.500.500.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.825', 'N06.850.520.450.500.500.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.825'], ['Z01.107.567.875']]","['Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Geographicals [Z]']",0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1
Knockdown of the interleukin-6 receptor alpha chain of dendritic cell vaccines enhances the therapeutic potential against IL-6 producing tumors.,"Tumor microenvironment has emerged as one of the major obstacles against the clinical efficacy of dendritic cell (DC) vaccines. Tumor-derived IL-6 may inhibit the differentiation of hematopoietic progenitor cells into DCs and suppress DC maturation, rendering DCs tolerogenic. We hypothesized that silencing the IL-6 receptor alpha chain (IL-6Rá) would restore the functional competence of DC vaccines in mice with an IL-6-producing TC-1 tumor, and eventually give rise to protective immunity. We found that the IL-6Rá knockdown-DC vaccine significantly enhanced the frequency of tumor-specific CD8(+) CTLs-producing effector molecules such as IFN-ã, TNF-á, FasL, perforin, and granzyme B, and generated more CD8(+) memory T cells, leading to the substantially prolonged survival of TC-1 tumor-bearing mice.","['Animals', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes', 'Cancer Vaccines', 'Dendritic Cells', 'Female', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Interleukin-6', 'Interleukin-6 Receptor alpha Subunit', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Neoplasms', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic']",20974308,"[['B01.050'], ['A11.118.637.555.567.569.220', 'A15.145.229.637.555.567.569.220', 'A15.382.490.555.567.569.220'], ['D20.215.894.200'], ['A11.066.270', 'A11.436.270', 'A15.382.066.270', 'A15.382.670.260'], ['E05.393.335.500'], ['D12.644.276.374.465.224', 'D12.776.467.374.465.202', 'D23.529.374.465.224'], ['D12.776.543.750.705.852.420.400.750'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500'], ['B01.050.050.199.520.520.420', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500.400.420'], ['C04'], ['A11.118.637.555.283.875', 'A11.118.637.555.567.550.500.200', 'A11.118.637.555.567.569.220.200', 'A11.118.637.555.567.569.500.200', 'A15.145.229.637.555.283.875', 'A15.145.229.637.555.567.550.500.200', 'A15.145.229.637.555.567.569.220.200', 'A15.145.229.637.555.567.569.500.200', 'A15.382.490.555.283.875', 'A15.382.490.555.567.550.500.200', 'A15.382.490.555.567.569.220.200', 'A15.382.490.555.567.569.500.200']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Diseases [C]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Oral calcium supplementation in premature and asphyxiated meonates.,"Biochemical and hormonal effects of oral calcium supplementation in premature and asphyxiated neonates during the first few days of life are described. Eight pairs of infants were matched for gestational age and one-minute Apgar score. One member of each pair served as a control and the other was given supplemental oral calcium (75 mg/kg/24 hr) beginning at 12 and ending at 72 hours of age. The supplemental infants had significantly higher serum calcium values both during the time of supplementation and for 36 hours after supplementation was stopped. The oral calcium supplements had no significant effect on serum concentrations of phosphate, magnesium, 25-hydroxy-vitamin D3, or parathyroid hormone, The incidence of hypocalcemia after 12 hours of age was 0 in eight supplemented infants and three in eight control infants. In patients at risk for hypocalcemia, prospective use of oral calcium supplements during the period when there is inadequate calcium intake from feedings may prevent hypocalcemia, appears to be without deleterious effect on measurable chemical and hormonal factors important in calcium homeostasis, and results in maintenance of higher serum calcium levels after supplementation has been discontinued.","['Administration, Oral', 'Adult', 'Apgar Score', 'Asphyxia Neonatorum', 'Calcium', 'Female', 'Gestational Age', 'Humans', 'Hypocalcemia', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Infant, Premature', 'Parathyroid Hormone', 'Vitamin D']",993926,"[['E02.319.267.100'], ['M01.060.116'], ['E01.370.600.050'], ['C16.614.092'], ['D01.268.552.100', 'D01.552.539.288', 'D23.119.100'], ['G07.345.500.325.235.968', 'G08.686.320'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C18.452.174.509', 'C18.452.950.509'], ['M01.060.703.520'], ['M01.060.703.520.520'], ['D06.472.699.590', 'D12.644.548.587'], ['D04.210.500.812.768']]","['Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

Results show that each individual foot shape can be predicted within a mean absolute error of 1.36 mm for the left foot and 1.37 mm for the right foot using the first method, and within a mean absolute error of 1.02 mm for the left foot and 1.02 mm for the right foot using the second method. The second method shows somewhat improved accuracy even though it requires two images. Both the methods are relatively cheaper than using a scanner to determine the 3D foot shape for custom footwear design.","['Adult', 'Foot', 'Hong Kong', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Models, Anatomic', 'Research Design', 'Shoes']",16087498,"[['M01.060.116'], ['A01.378.610.250'], ['Z01.252.474.164.450'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['J01.897.280.500.545.129', 'L01.178.820.090.545.129'], ['E05.581.500', 'H01.770.644.728'], ['J01.637.215.800']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]']",1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,1
Risk of Severe Hypoglycemia in Type 1 Diabetes Over 30 Years of Follow-up in the DCCT/EDIC Study.,"OBJECTIVE: During the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT), intensive diabetes therapy achieving a mean HbA1c of ?7% was associated with a threefold increase in the rate of severe hypoglycemia (defined as requiring assistance) compared with conventional diabetes therapy with a mean HbA1c of 9% (61.2 vs. 18.7 per 100 patient-years). After ?30 years of follow-up, we investigated the rates of severe hypoglycemia in the DCCT/Epidemiology of Diabetes Inverventions and Complications (EDIC) cohort.RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Rates of severe hypoglycemia were reported quarterly during DCCT and annually during EDIC (i.e., patient recall of episodes in the preceding 3 months). Risk factors influencing the rate of severe hypoglycemia over time were investigated.RESULTS: One-half of the DCCT/EDIC cohort reported episodes of severe hypoglycemia. During EDIC, rates of severe hypoglycemia fell in the former DCCT intensive treatment group but rose in the former conventional treatment group, resulting in similar rates (36.6 vs. 40.8 episodes per 100 patient-years, respectively) with a relative risk of 1.12 (95% CI 0.91-1.37). A preceding episode of severe hypoglycemia was the most powerful predictor of subsequent episodes. Entry into the DCCT study as an adolescent was associated with an increased risk of severe hypoglycemia, whereas insulin pump use was associated with a lower risk. Severe hypoglycemia rates increased with lower HbA1c similarly among participants in both treatment groups.CONCLUSIONS: Rates of severe hypoglycemia have equilibrated over time between the two DCCT/EDIC treatment groups in association with advancing duration of diabetes and similar HbA1c levels. Severe hypoglycemia persists and remains a challenge for patients with type 1 diabetes across their life span.","['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Cohort Studies', 'Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Glycated Hemoglobin A', 'Humans', 'Hypoglycemia', 'Insulin', 'Male', 'Risk Factors', 'Young Adult']",28550194,"[['M01.060.057'], ['M01.060.116'], ['E05.318.372.500.750', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750'], ['C18.452.394.750.124', 'C19.246.267', 'C20.111.327'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.249', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.350', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.350'], ['D09.400.430.937', 'D12.776.124.400.405.440', 'D12.776.395.381', 'D12.776.422.316.762.380.440'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C18.452.394.984'], ['D06.472.699.587.200.500.625', 'D12.644.548.586.200.500.625'], ['E05.318.740.600.800.725', 'N05.715.350.200.700', 'N05.715.360.750.625.700.700', 'N06.850.490.625.750', 'N06.850.520.830.600.800.725'], ['M01.060.116.815']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
Long-term effect on symptoms and quality of life of maintenance therapy with esomeprazole 20 mg daily: a post hoc analysis of the LOTUS trial.,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the long-term effect on symptoms and quality of life of esomeprazole 20 mg once daily, a recommended dose for maintenance therapy of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This is a post hoc analysis of 5 year data from patients in the LOTUS trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00251927) who were randomized to esomeprazole 20 mg once daily. All participants had chronic, symptomatic GERD responsive to treatment. Gastrointestinal symptoms were assessed by physicians and by using patient-reported outcome instruments. Investigations included gastrointestinal endoscopy (with biopsy sampling), 24 hour esophageal pH monitoring and laboratory measurements.RESULTS: In total, 157 of 256 patients randomized to esomeprazole 20 mg once daily remained on this dose until the end of follow-up or study discontinuation, whereas 99 patients had their dose increased because of inadequate symptom control (of these, 29 subsequently returned to the allocated dose). On logistic regression, a long objectively defined GERD history, smoking, female sex, absence of Helicobacter pylori infection and high supine baseline acid reflux into the esophagus were associated with an increased likelihood of requiring dose escalation to esomeprazole 40 mg daily (all p < 0.05). Symptoms were fairly stable and quality of life was normal throughout follow-up in patients remaining on esomeprazole 20 mg once daily, with no more than mild symptom severity, and mean (standard deviation) percentage time with intraesophageal pH <4 was reduced from 10.7 (10.7) pre-randomization to 6.3 (10.2) at 6 months and 4.9 (7.3) at 5 years. The number of serious adverse events was low (0.079 per patient per year).LIMITATIONS: Post hoc analysis with no control group.CONCLUSIONS: Esomeprazole at a maintenance dose of 20 mg once daily offers effective long-term treatment for chronic GERD in patients initially responsive to the medication, with durable symptom control and sustained reductions in intraesophageal acid exposure.","['Adult', 'Aged', 'Endoscopy, Gastrointestinal', 'Esomeprazole', 'Esophageal pH Monitoring', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Gastroesophageal Reflux', 'Health Status', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Quality of Life', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']",25350223,"[['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['E01.370.372.250.250', 'E01.370.388.250.250.250', 'E04.210.240.250', 'E04.502.250.250.250'], ['D02.886.640.074.500.500', 'D03.383.725.024.500.500', 'D03.633.100.103.034.500.500'], ['E01.370.372.255', 'E01.370.520.215'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.249', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.350', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.350'], ['C06.405.117.119.500.484'], ['I01.240.425', 'N01.224.425', 'N06.850.505.400.425'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['I01.800', 'K01.752.400.750', 'N06.850.505.400.425.837'], ['G01.910.857'], ['E01.789.800', 'N04.761.559.590.800', 'N05.715.360.575.575.800']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Humanities [K]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0
Fabrication and application of TiO2-based superhydrophilic-superhydrophobic patterns on titanium substrates for offset printing.,"A fabrication process for superhydrophilic-superhydrophilic patterns on titanium substrates prepared through a combination of an ink-jet technique and site-selective decomposition of a self-assembled monolayer (SAM) by a TiO(2) photocatalyst under UV irradiation is described. We demonstrate that the prepared titanium substrate is applicable as an offset printing plate with high resolution (133 and 150 lines per inch). Furthermore, the superhydrophilic-superhydrophobic patterns on the substrate can be deposited repeatedly after elimination of the patterns by photocatalytic decomposition of TiO(2) under UV irradiation. A second printed image with the renewed substrate showed no significant difference in image quality compared with the initial image.","['Catalysis', 'Hydrophobic and Hydrophilic Interactions', 'Printing', 'Titanium', 'Ultraviolet Rays', 'X-Ray Diffraction']",19322804,"[['G02.130'], ['G02.409'], ['L01.737.787'], ['D01.268.557.800', 'D01.268.956.878', 'D01.552.547.800'], ['G01.358.500.505.650.891', 'G01.590.540.891', 'G01.750.250.650.891', 'G01.750.750.659', 'G01.750.770.578.891', 'G16.500.275.063.725.525.600', 'G16.500.750.775.525.600', 'N06.230.300.100.725.525.600'], ['E05.196.309.742', 'E05.196.822.950', 'G01.867.950', 'G02.965']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0
"Analysis of cytokinin mutants and regulation of cytokinin metabolic genes reveals important regulatory roles of cytokinins in drought, salt and abscisic acid responses, and abscisic acid biosynthesis.","Cytokinins (CKs) regulate plant growth and development via a complex network of CK signaling. Here, we perform functional analyses with CK-deficient plants to provide direct evidence that CKs negatively regulate salt and drought stress signaling. All CK-deficient plants with reduced levels of various CKs exhibited a strong stress-tolerant phenotype that was associated with increased cell membrane integrity and abscisic acid (ABA) hypersensitivity rather than stomatal density and ABA-mediated stomatal closure. Expression of the Arabidopsis thaliana ISOPENTENYL-TRANSFERASE genes involved in the biosynthesis of bioactive CKs and the majority of the Arabidopsis CYTOKININ OXIDASES/DEHYDROGENASES genes was repressed by stress and ABA treatments, leading to a decrease in biologically active CK contents. These results demonstrate a novel mechanism for survival under abiotic stress conditions via the homeostatic regulation of steady state CK levels. Additionally, under normal conditions, although CK deficiency increased the sensitivity of plants to exogenous ABA, it caused a downregulation of key ABA biosynthetic genes, leading to a significant reduction in endogenous ABA levels in CK-deficient plants relative to the wild type. Taken together, this study provides direct evidence that mutual regulation mechanisms exist between the CK and ABA metabolism and signals underlying different processes regulating plant adaptation to stressors as well as plant growth and development.","['Abscisic Acid', 'Adaptation, Physiological', 'Arabidopsis', 'Arabidopsis Proteins', 'Cell Membrane', 'Cytokinins', 'Droughts', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Plant', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Phenotype', 'Plant Stomata', 'Salts', 'Seeds', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stress, Physiological']",21719693,"[['D02.241.223.268.034', 'D02.455.326.271.665.202.061', 'D02.455.426.392.368.367.379.249.024', 'D02.455.849.131.061', 'D02.455.849.765.521.500'], ['G07.025', 'G16.012.500'], ['B01.650.940.800.575.912.250.157.100'], ['D12.776.765.149'], ['A11.284.149'], ['D03.633.100.759.138.525'], ['G16.500.175.781', 'G16.500.750.775.154', 'N06.230.100.230.150'], ['G05.308.375'], ['L01.453.245.667'], ['G05.695'], ['A18.024.750.650', 'A18.024.812.650'], ['D01.786'], ['A18.024.500.750', 'G07.203.300.775', 'J02.500.775'], ['G02.111.820', 'G04.835'], ['G07.775']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]']",1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0
Problems in diagnosis of Hirschsprung's disease by anorectal manometry.,"The purpose of this study is to analyze the results of anorectal manometry and to evaluate the merits and disadvantages of this technique for the diagnosis of Hirschsprung's disease. Studies were performed in 268 patients with constipation, including 95 cases of Hirschsprung's disease. It is concluded from the results that Hirschsprung's disease can be confidently diagnosed by manometric studies. If the studies are performed carefully with a suitable probe, reliability is over 95%. Manometry is the most useful method to differentiate Hirschsprung's disease from other conditions, such as extremely short segment aganglionosis, colonic stenosis, and idiopathic megacolon.","['Adolescent', 'Anal Canal', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Constipation', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Hirschsprung Disease', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Manometry', 'Rectum', 'Reflex']",2513612,"[['M01.060.057'], ['A03.556.124.526.070', 'A03.556.249.249.070'], ['M01.060.406'], ['M01.060.406.448'], ['C23.888.821.150'], ['E01.171'], ['C06.198.439', 'C06.405.469.158.701.439', 'C16.131.314.439'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.703'], ['M01.060.703.520'], ['E05.559'], ['A03.556.124.526.767', 'A03.556.249.249.767'], ['E01.370.376.550.650', 'E01.370.600.550.650', 'F02.830.702', 'G11.561.731']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
An inventory of publications on electronic medical records revisited.,"OBJECTIVES: In this short review we provide an update of our earlier inventories of publications indexed in MedLine with the MeSH term 'Medical Records Systems, Computerized'.METHODS: We retrieved and analyzed all references to English articles published before January 1, 2008, and indexed in PubMed with the MeSH term 'Medical Records Systems, Computerized'.RESULTS: We retrieved a total of 11,924 publications, of which 3937 (33%) appeared in a journal with an impact factor. Since 2002 the number of yearly publications, and the number of journals in which those publications appeared, increased. A cluster analysis revealed three clusters: an organizational issues cluster, a technically oriented cluster and a cluster about order-entry and research.CONCLUSIONS: Although our previous inventory in 2003 suggested a constant yearly production of publications on electronic medical records since 1998, the current inventory shows another rise in production since 2002. In addition, many new journals and countries have shown interest during the last five years. In the last 15 years, interest in organizational issues remained fairly constant, order entry and research with systems gained attention, while interest in technical issues relatively decreased.","['Bibliometrics', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Equipment and Supplies', 'Humans', 'Journal Impact Factor', 'MEDLINE', 'Medical Records Systems, Computerized', 'Netherlands', 'PubMed', 'Publishing', 'United States']",19448887,"[['L01.178.682.099.325', 'L01.453.183.291'], ['E05.318.740.250', 'N05.715.360.750.200', 'N06.850.520.830.250'], ['E07'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['L01.178.682.099.325.500', 'L01.453.183.291.500'], ['L01.313.500.750.280.710.500', 'L01.313.500.750.280.750.500', 'L01.313.500.750.300.188.300.650.500', 'L01.313.500.750.300.710.500', 'L01.313.500.750.300.742.650.500', 'L01.470.750.500.650.500'], ['E05.318.308.940.968.625', 'L01.313.500.750.300.695', 'N04.452.859.564.650', 'N05.715.360.300.715.500.530', 'N06.850.520.308.940.968.625'], ['Z01.542.651'], ['L01.313.500.750.280.750', 'L01.313.500.750.300.188.300.650', 'L01.313.500.750.300.742.650', 'L01.470.750.500.650'], ['L01.737'], ['Z01.107.567.875']]","['Information Science [L]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Geographicals [Z]']",0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1
Model-based multi-view fusion of cinematic flow and optical imaging.,"Bioluminescence imaging (BLI) offers the possibility to study and image biology at molecular scale in small animals with applications in oncology or gene expression studies. Here we present a novel model-based approach to 3D animal tracking from monocular video which allows the quantification of bioluminescence signal on freely moving animals. The 3D animal pose and the illumination are dynamically estimated through minimization of an objective function with constraints on the bioluminescence signal position. Derived from an inverse problem formulation, the objective function enables explicit use of temporal continuity and shading information, while handling important self-occlusions and time-varying illumination. In this model-based framework, we include a constraint on the 3D position of bioluminescence signal to enforce tracking of the biologically produced signal. The minimization is done efficiently using a quasi-Newton method, with a rigorous derivation of the objective function gradient. Promising experimental results demonstrate the potentials of our approach for 3D accurate measurement with freely moving animal.","['Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Image Enhancement', 'Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted', 'Imaging, Three-Dimensional', 'Luminescent Measurements', 'Pattern Recognition, Automated', 'Photography', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Subtraction Technique', 'Video Recording']",20879373,"[['G17.035', 'L01.224.050'], ['B01.050'], ['E01.370.350.600.350', 'L01.224.308.380'], ['E01.158.600', 'E01.370.350.350', 'L01.313.500.750.100.158.600'], ['E01.370.350.400', 'L01.224.308.410'], ['E05.196.712.516'], ['L01.399.750'], ['E01.370.350.600', 'E05.712'], ['E05.318.370.725', 'E05.337.851', 'N05.715.360.325.685', 'N06.850.520.445.725'], ['E05.318.370.800', 'E05.318.740.872', 'G17.800', 'N05.715.360.325.700', 'N05.715.360.750.725', 'N06.850.520.445.800', 'N06.850.520.830.872'], ['E01.370.350.760'], ['L01.280.960']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]']",0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0

Levels of the prylated, active forms of MEK, ERK-1/2, RSK1 and CREB, and the expression levels of Bcl-2 family were assayed by Western Blotting.RESULTS: Lithium increased the activities of MEK, ERK-1/2, RSK1, and CREB, up-regulated the expression of Bcl-2, and down-regulated the expression of Bax in rat brain hippocampus and frontal cortex.CONCLUSION: Chronic in vivo lithium administration activities ERK-1/2 signal pathway and regulates the expression of Bcl-2 family proteins in the central nervous system, which may associate with the therapeutic effects of lithium in the treatment of manic depression.","['Animals', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Lithium Carbonate', 'Male', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar', 'Signal Transduction']",14653110,"[['B01.050'], ['F03.084.500'], ['A08.186.211'], ['D01.045.125.500', 'D01.200.275.150.550', 'D01.510.475'], ['D08.811.913.696.620.682.700.567.249.500', 'D12.644.360.450.169.500', 'D12.776.476.450.169.500'], ['D08.811.913.696.620.682.700.567.249.750', 'D12.644.360.450.169.750', 'D12.776.476.450.169.750'], ['D08.811.913.696.620.682.700.567', 'D12.644.360.450', 'D12.776.476.450'], ['D12.644.360.075.718', 'D12.776.476.075.718', 'D12.776.624.664.700.169'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700.900'], ['G02.111.820', 'G04.835']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",1,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Causes of increasing mortality in a nursing home population.,"OBJECTIVE: To examine the roles played by changes in case-mix, quality of care, and aggressiveness of care in explaining the 42% increase in mortality of the Medicaid nursing home population of Hennepin County, Minnesota, between 1984 and 1988.DESIGN: Retrospective chart review.SETTING: All nursing homes in Hennepin County, MN, that care for Medicaid patients.PATIENTS: A random sample of 1605 Medicaid nursing home residents from 1984 and 1988 stratified by year and by whether the resident died in that year. Sampling was disproportionate to allow approximately 400 individuals per stratum. A total of 1405 charts (87%) were reviewed; the remainder were either lost or destroyed.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Measures included case-mix (Charlson index, functional status, implicit reviewer assigned severity [range 1-4]), aggressiveness of care (orders limiting care), quality of care (process of care for tracer conditions [range 1-5], falls), and resident death.RESULTS: Implicitly rated severity of illness worsened between 1984 and 1988 (2.77 vs 2.91; P = .009), but other measures of case-mix were unchanged. A greater percentage of residents had a DNR order in 1988 (12% in 1984 vs 37% in 1988; P < .001), and more received less aggressive care (31% vs 40%; P = .006). Overall process of care improved between 1984 and 1988 (2.88 vs 3.01; P < .05). With adjustment of the mortality rates and with logistic regression controlling for age and gender, changes in quality of care alone accounted for less than 5% of the mortality rate change between 1984 and 1988, case-mix alone accounted for 49%, and aggressiveness of care alone accounted for nearly 100%.CONCLUSIONS: The nursing home population became sicker between 1984 and 1988, but process of care improved. These changes had a modest effect on the mortality rate. The increase in less aggressive care between 1984 and 1988 accounts for nearly all of the increase in mortality.","['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cause of Death', 'Diagnosis-Related Groups', 'Female', 'Geriatric Assessment', 'Health Services Research', 'Homes for the Aged', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Medicaid', 'Minnesota', 'Nursing Homes', 'Quality of Health Care', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'United States']",8600193,"[['M01.060.116.100'], ['M01.060.116.100.080'], ['E05.318.308.985.550.250', 'N01.224.935.698.100', 'N06.850.505.400.975.550.250', 'N06.850.520.308.985.550.250'], ['N03.219.521.710.305.200.080'], ['E05.318.308.225', 'I01.240.425.350', 'N01.224.425.350', 'N05.715.360.300.360', 'N06.850.505.400.425.350', 'N06.850.520.308.225'], ['H01.770.644.145.360', 'N03.349.380', 'N05.425'], ['J03.775.462', 'N02.278.825.462'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['N03.219.521.346.506.564.655', 'N03.706.615.693'], ['Z01.107.567.875.350.510', 'Z01.107.567.875.510.510'], ['N02.278.825.610'], ['N04.761', 'N05.715'], ['E05.318.372.500.500.500', 'E05.318.372.500.750.750', 'N05.715.360.330.500.500.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.825', 'N06.850.520.450.500.500.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.825'], ['E05.318.308.980.438.475.456.500', 'N05.715.360.300.800.438.375.364.500', 'N06.850.520.308.980.438.475.364.500'], ['Z01.107.567.875']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Geographicals [Z]']",0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1
Pipecolic acid enhances resistance to bacterial infection and primes salicylic acid and nicotine accumulation in tobacco.,"Distinct amino acid metabolic pathways constitute integral parts of the plant immune system. We have recently identified pipecolic acid (Pip), a lysine-derived non-protein amino acid, as a critical regulator of systemic acquired resistance (SAR) and basal immunity to bacterial infection in Arabidopsis thaliana. In Arabidopsis, Pip acts as an endogenous mediator of defense amplification and priming. For instance, Pip conditions plants for effective biosynthesis of the phenolic defense signal salicylic acid (SA), accumulation of the phytoalexin camalexin, and expression of defense-related genes. Here, we show that tobacco plants respond to leaf infection by the compatible bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv tabaci (Pstb) with a significant accumulation of several amino acids, including Lys, branched-chain, aromatic, and amide group amino acids. Moreover, Pstb strongly triggers, alongside the biosynthesis of SA and increases in the defensive alkaloid nicotine, the production of the Lys catabolites Pip and á-aminoadipic acid. Exogenous application of Pip to tobacco plants provides significant protection to infection by adapted Pstb or by non-adapted, hypersensitive cell death-inducing P. syringae pv maculicola. Pip thereby primes tobacco for rapid and strong accumulation of SA and nicotine following bacterial infection. Thus, our study indicates that the role of Pip as an amplifier of immune responses is conserved between members of the rosid and asterid groups of eudicot plants and suggests a broad practical applicability for Pip as a natural enhancer of plant disease resistance.","['2-Aminoadipic Acid', 'Amines', 'Amino Acids', 'Disease Resistance', 'Nicotine', 'Pipecolic Acids', 'Plant Diseases', 'Plant Leaves', 'Plant Roots', 'Pseudomonas syringae', 'Salicylic Acid', 'Time Factors', 'Tobacco']",24025239,"[['D02.241.081.337.052.075', 'D12.125.119.075'], ['D02.092'], ['D12.125'], ['C23.550.291.671', 'G12.450.564.250', 'G12.450.800.250', 'G15.630.250'], ['D03.132.760.570', 'D03.383.725.518'], ['D03.066.758', 'D03.383.621.758'], ['G15.610'], ['A18.024.812'], ['A18.400'], ['B03.440.400.425.625.625.770', 'B03.660.250.580.590.770'], ['D02.241.223.100.300.595.608', 'D02.241.511.390.595.608', 'D02.455.426.559.389.127.281.595.608', 'D02.455.426.559.389.657.410.595.608'], ['G01.910.857'], ['B01.650.940.800.575.912.250.908.500.900']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Organisms [B]']",1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Correlation between the body mass index (BMI) of pregnant women and the development of hypotension after spinal anesthesia for cesarean section.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Very few publications correlate hypotension in obese pregnant women, and especially morbidly obese, after spinal anesthesia for cesarean section. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the incidence of hypotension according to the BMI.METHODS: Forty-nine patients with pregestational BMI below 25 kg.m(-2) were included in the Eutrophia group, and 51 patients with BMI ? 25 kg.m(-2) were included in the Overweight group. After spinal anesthesia, blood pressure, volume of crystalloid infused, and dose of vasopressors used until delivery were recorded. A fall in systolic blood pressure below 100 mmHg or 10% reduction of the initial systolic blood pressure (SBP) was considered as hypotension and it was corrected by the administration of vasopressors.RESULTS: Episodes of hypotension were fewer in the Eutrophia group (5.89 ± 0.53 vs. 7.80 ± 0.66, p = 0.027), as well as the amount of crystalloid administered (1,298 ± 413.6 mL vs. 1,539 ± 460.0 mL; p = 0.007), and use of vasopressors (5.87 ± 3.45 bolus vs. 7.70 ± 4.46 bolus; p = 0.023). As for associated diseases, we observed higher incidence of diabetes among obese pregnant women (29.41% vs. 9.76%, RR 1.60, 95%CI: 1.15-2.22, p = 0.036), however, differences in the incidence of pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH) were not observe between both groups (overweight: 21.57%, normal weight: 12.20%, RR 1.30, 95%CI: 0.88-1.94, p = 0.28).CONCLUSIONS: In the study sample, pregestational BMI ? 25 kg.m(-2) was a risk factor for hypotension after spinal anesthesia in patients undergoing cesarean section. The same group of patients required higher doses of vasopressors. Those results indicate that the anesthetic techniques in those patients should be improved to reduce the consequences of post-spinal anesthesia hypotension, both in pregnant women and fetuses.","['Anesthesia, Obstetrical', 'Anesthesia, Spinal', 'Body Mass Index', 'Cesarean Section', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hypotension', 'Obesity', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Complications']",21334504,"[['E03.155.364'], ['E03.155.086.331'], ['E01.370.600.115.100.125', 'E05.041.124.125', 'G07.100.100.125', 'N06.850.505.200.100.175'], ['E04.520.252.500'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C14.907.514'], ['C18.654.726.500', 'C23.888.144.699.500', 'E01.370.600.115.100.160.120.699.500', 'G07.100.100.160.120.699.500'], ['G08.686.784.769'], ['C13.703']]","['Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]']",0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
Local airway anesthesia attenuates hemodynamic responses to intubation and extubation in hypertensive surgical patients.,"BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of topical ropivacaine anesthesia on hemodynamic responses during intubation and extubation of hypertensive patients.MATERIAL AND METHODS: One hundred fifty patients with hypertension ASA II-III were scheduled for noncardiac operations. Patients were divided into 3 groups: a control group receiving 5 ml saline, and 2 groups receiving topical anesthesia with 100 mg lidocaine or 37.5 mg ropivacaine. Hemodynamic responses, including blood pressure and heart rate (HR), were recorded at baseline (T0), before intubation (T1), during tracheal intubation (T2), 2 min after intubation (T3), upon eye opening on verbal commands (T4), during tracheal extubation (T5), and 2 min after extubation (T6). Patients were injected with urapidil 5 mg during intubation and extubation if their systolic blood pressure (SBP) was ?160 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) was ³90 mmHg, and esmolol 10 mg when HR was ?90 bpm.RESULTS: During extubation, the total dosages of urapidil and esmolol were significantly higher in the saline than in the lidocaine or ropivacaine groups, and were significantly lower in the ropivacaine than in the lidocaine group. At T2, SBP, SBP, MAP, and HR were lower in the lidocaine and ropivacaine groups than in the saline group, but the differences were not significant. From T4 to T6, SBP, DBP, MAP, and HR were significantly lower in the ropivacaine group than in the other 2 groups (P<0.05 each).CONCLUSIONS: Topical lidocaine and ropivacaine anesthesia can effectively reduce hemodynamic responses during intubation, with ropivacaine better at inhibiting hemodynamic changes at emergence in hypertensive patients.","['Airway Extubation', 'Amides', 'Anesthesia, Local', 'Antihypertensive Agents', 'Arterial Pressure', 'Demography', 'Diastole', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Heart Rate', 'Hemodynamics', 'Humans', 'Hypertension', 'Intubation, Intratracheal', 'Lidocaine', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Piperazines', 'Propanolamines', 'Ropivacaine', 'Systole']",25175842,"[['E02.041.249', 'E05.008'], ['D02.065'], ['E03.155.086.231'], ['D27.505.954.411.162'], ['G09.330.380.076.347'], ['I01.240', 'N01.224', 'N06.850.505.400'], ['G09.330.580.295', 'G11.427.494.554.250', 'G11.427.494.570.295'], ['G07.690.773.875', 'G07.690.936.500'], ['E01.370.600.875.500', 'G09.330.380.500'], ['G09.330.380'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C14.907.489'], ['E02.041.500', 'E02.585.578', 'E05.497.578'], ['D02.065.199.092.500', 'D02.092.146.113.092.500'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['D03.383.606'], ['D02.033.100.624', 'D02.033.755.624', 'D02.092.063.624'], ['D02.065.199.825', 'D02.092.146.113.825'], ['G09.330.580.880', 'G11.427.494.570.880']]","['Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Named Groups [M]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0
Carotid endarterectomy in nonagenarians.,"HYPOTHESIS: The North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial and the European Carotid Surgery Trial demonstrated that a greater benefit from carotid endarterectomy (CEA) was seen in elderly compared with younger patients. However, no patients older than 89 years were included in either study. We hypothesized that CEA is safe and effective in patients 89 years and older.DESIGN AND SETTING: This is a retrospective review of 3 neurosurgeons' CEA experience with nonagenarian patients.PARTICIPANTS AND INTERVENTIONS: Of our 1800 patients who underwent CEA, 26 were 89 years or older. Twenty-three patients had had cerebral ischemic symptoms (unilateral hemispheric symptoms in 21 and 2 dizzy spells associated with bilateral high-grade stenosis). Cerebral angiography was performed in 3 patients. Twenty-three patients underwent noninvasive imaging. Four patients had bilateral high-grade stenosis and underwent staged bilateral CEA. All procedures were performed after the induction of general anesthesia with electroencephalographic (and, more recently, transcranial Doppler) monitoring and etomidate-induced burst suppression for cerebral protection during cross-clamping.RESULTS: Unusual technical difficulties were frequently noted, including high bifurcations, looping rotated internal carotid arteries, and marked adherence of surrounding soft tissues. In 3 of the 30 procedures, a shunt was used. There were no perioperative cerebral ischemic or cardiac events. The mean hospital stay was 2 days. One patient had a transient vocal cord paresis. Twenty-two patients were alive and well 24 months following the procedure. Four patients died of non-stroke-related causes.CONCLUSIONS: Carotid endarterectomy was successfully performed without perioperative cerebral or cardiac complications in our series of 26 patients 89 years and older undergoing 30 CEAs. Extrapolating from reported results from the North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial and the European Carotid Surgery Trial, we believe CEA should be considered in nonagenarian patients with high-grade symptomatic carotid stenosis who are otherwise well medically. Our recommendations are less certain in the case of asymptomatic disease.","['Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Carotid Stenosis', 'Cause of Death', 'Cohort Studies', 'Endarterectomy, Carotid', 'Female', 'Geriatric Assessment', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Monitoring, Intraoperative', 'Postoperative Complications', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Assessment', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Ultrasonography, Doppler']",16028346,"[['N05.715.350.075', 'N06.850.490.250'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['M01.060.116.100.080'], ['C10.228.140.300.200.360', 'C14.907.137.230', 'C14.907.253.123.360'], ['E05.318.308.985.550.250', 'N01.224.935.698.100', 'N06.850.505.400.975.550.250', 'N06.850.520.308.985.550.250'], ['E05.318.372.500.750', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750'], ['E04.100.814.456.250'], ['E05.318.308.225', 'I01.240.425.350', 'N01.224.425.350', 'N05.715.360.300.360', 'N06.850.505.400.425.350', 'N06.850.520.308.225'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E01.370.520.510', 'E04.510'], ['C23.550.767'], ['E01.789'], ['E05.318.372.500.500.500', 'E05.318.372.500.750.750', 'N05.715.360.330.500.500.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.825', 'N06.850.520.450.500.500.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.825'], ['E05.318.740.600.800.715', 'N04.452.871.715', 'N05.715.360.750.625.700.690', 'N06.850.505.715', 'N06.850.520.830.600.800.715'], ['E05.318.308.980.438.475.456.500', 'N05.715.360.300.800.438.375.364.500', 'N06.850.520.308.980.438.475.364.500'], ['E05.318.308.985.550.900', 'N01.224.935.698.826', 'N06.850.505.400.975.550.900', 'N06.850.520.308.985.550.900'], ['E01.789.800', 'N04.761.559.590.800', 'N05.715.360.575.575.800'], ['E01.370.350.850.850']]","['Health Care [N]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Organisms [B]']",0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0
Relationship between mercury accumulation in young-of-the-year yellow perch and water-level fluctuations.,"A three-year (2001-2003) monitoring effort of 14 northeastern Minnesota lakes was conducted to document relationships between water-level fluctuations and mercury bioaccumulation in young-of-the-year (YOY) yellow perch (Perca flavescens) collected in the fall of each year at fixed locations. Six of those lakes are located within or adjacent to Voyageurs National Park and are influenced by dams on the outlets of Rainy and Namakan lakes. One site on Sand Point Lake coincides with a location that has nine years of previous monitoring suitable for addressing the same issue over a longer time frame. Mean mercury concentrations in YOY yellow perch at each sampling location varied significantly from year to year. For the 12-year monitoring site on Sand Point Lake, values ranged from 38 ng gww(-1) in 1998 to 200 ng gww(-1) in 2001. For the 14-lake study, annual mean concentrations ranged by nearly a factor of 2, on average, for each lake over the three years of record. One likely factor responsible for these wide variations is that annual water-level fluctuations are strongly correlated with mercury levels in YOY perch for both data sets.","['Animals', 'Mercury', 'Perches', 'Water Pollutants, Chemical']",16382948,"[['B01.050'], ['D01.268.556.504', 'D01.268.956.437', 'D01.552.544.504'], ['B01.050.150.900.493.602.600'], ['D27.888.284.903.655']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]']",0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The effect of exercise on postprandial lipidemia in type 2 diabetic patients.,"To elucidate if postprandial exercise can reduce the exaggerated lipidemia seen in type 2 diabetic patients after a high-fat meal. Two mornings eight type 2 diabetic patients (males) (58 +/- 1.2 years, BMI 28.0 +/- 0.9 kg m(-2)) and seven non-diabetic controls ate a high-fat breakfast (680 kcal m(-2), 84% fat). On one morning, 90 min later subjects cycled 60 min at 57% VO(2max). Biopsies from quadriceps muscle and abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue were sampled after exercise or equivalent period of rest and arterialized blood for 615 min. Postprandial increases in serum total-triglyceride (TG) (incremental AUC: 1,702 +/- 576 vs. 341 +/- 117 mmol l(-1) 600 min), chylomicron-TG (incremental AUC: 1,331 +/- 495 vs. 184 +/- 55 mmol l(-1) 600 min) and VLDL-TG as well as in insulin (incremental AUC: 33,946 +/- 7,414 vs. 13,670 +/- 3,250 pmol l(-1) 600 min), C-peptide and glucose were higher in diabetic patients than in non-diabetic controls (P < 0.05). In diabetic patients these variables were reduced (P < 0.05) by exercise (total-TG incremental AUC being 1,110 +/- 444, chylomicron-TG incremental AUC 1,043 +/- 474 mmol l(-1) 600 min and insulin incremental AUC 18,668 +/- 4,412 pmol l(-1) 600 min). Lipoprotein lipase activity in muscle (11.0 +/- 2.0 vs. 24.1 +/- 3.4 mU g per wet weight, P < 0.05) and post-heparin plasma at 615 min were lower in diabetic patients than in non-diabetic controls, but did not differ in adipose tissue and did not change with exercise. In diabetic patients, 210 min after exercise oxygen uptake (P < 0.05) and fat oxidation (P < 0.1) were still higher than on non-exercise days. In type 2 diabetic patients, after a high-fat meal exercise reduces the plasma concentrations of triglyceride contained in both chylomicrons and VLDL as well as insulin secretion. This suggests protection against progression of atherosclerosis and diabetes.","['Adipose Tissue', 'Area Under Curve', 'Blood Glucose', 'C-Peptide', 'Chylomicrons', 'Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2', 'Dietary Fats', 'Exercise', 'Exercise Therapy', 'Humans', 'Hyperlipidemias', 'Insulin', 'Lipase', 'Lipoproteins, VLDL', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Oxygen Consumption', 'Postprandial Period', 'Quadriceps Muscle', 'Triglycerides']",17952452,"[['A10.165.114'], ['E05.318.740.200', 'G03.787.101', 'G07.690.725.064', 'N06.850.520.830.200'], ['D09.947.875.359.448.500'], ['D06.472.699.587.200.500.250', 'D12.644.548.586.200.500.250'], ['D10.532.183', 'D12.776.521.242'], ['C18.452.394.750.149', 'C19.246.300'], ['D10.212.302', 'G07.203.300.375', 'J02.500.375'], ['G11.427.410.698.277', 'I03.350'], ['E02.760.169.063.500.387', 'E02.779.483', 'E02.831.535.483'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C18.452.584.500.500'], ['D06.472.699.587.200.500.625', 'D12.644.548.586.200.500.625'], ['D08.811.277.352.100.400'], ['D10.532.599', 'D12.776.521.622'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['G03.680'], ['G10.261.700'], ['A02.633.567.850'], ['D10.351.801']]","['Anatomy [A]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Named Groups [M]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0
"Clinicopathological correlation of retinal pigment epithelial tears in exudative age related macular degeneration: pretear, tear, and scarred tear.","AIMS: To analyse the histopathology of vascularised pigment epithelial detachments and tears of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) in age related macular degeneration (AMD).METHODS: The light microscopic architecture of 10 surgically removed subretinal specimens-three vascularised pigment epithelial detachments, four recent tears, and three scarred tears as a manifestation of AMD-were studied and correlated with the angiographic findings.RESULTS: Recent tears: a large fibrovascular membrane was found to be originally situated in Bruch's membrane. About half of the surface of the fibrovascular tissue was denuded of RPE and diffuse drusen. The RPE and diffuse drusen had retracted and rolled up, covering a neighbouring part of the intra-Bruch's fibrovascular membrane. The rolled up RPE and diffuse drusen were not interspersed with fibrovascular tissue but lay superficial to the intra-Bruch's fibrovascular membrane itself. Scarred tears: a collagen capsule surrounded the rolled up diffuse drusen and RPE. Fibrovascular tissue was found inside the rolled up material, predominantly at its choroidal side.CONCLUSION: The area of choroidal neovascularisation associated with a vascularised pigment epithelial detachment and a tear of the RPE may be larger than was hitherto thought or indicated by fluorescein angiography. This neovascular tissue may be present within the bed of the RPE tear, as well as at the site of the scrolled up RPE.","['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Bruch Membrane', 'Cell Movement', 'Collagen', 'Coloring Agents', 'Female', 'Fluorescein Angiography', 'Humans', 'Indocyanine Green', 'Macular Degeneration', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neovascularization, Pathologic', 'Pigment Epithelium of Eye', 'Retinal Detachment', 'Retinal Drusen', 'Retinal Perforations', 'Retinal Vessels', 'Staining and Labeling']",11264137,"[['M01.060.116.100'], ['M01.060.116.100.080'], ['A09.371.894.223.250', 'A10.272.220.250', 'A10.615.179.250'], ['G04.198', 'G07.568.500.180'], ['D05.750.078.280', 'D12.776.860.300.250'], ['D27.720.233'], ['E01.370.370.050.350', 'E01.370.380.250'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D03.633.100.473.400'], ['C11.768.585.439'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['C23.550.589.500'], ['A09.371.670', 'A10.272.640'], ['C11.768.648'], ['C11.768.585.585'], ['C11.768.740'], ['A07.015.611'], ['E01.370.225.500.620.670', 'E01.370.225.750.600.670', 'E05.200.500.620.670', 'E05.200.750.600.670']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

Quantifying intersectionality: An important advancement for health inequality research.,"BACKGROUND: Intersectionality is a powerful theoretical framework that is useful in describing the lived experiences of people with multiple marginalized statuses. By focusing on power and domination (e.g., racism, sexism), and the ways in which they are inextricably linked and mutually constructing, researchers can better understand experiences of all people, not just those with one or more master statuses. This framework is valuable in understanding how discrimination relates to health and in attempts to reduce health disparities.RATIONALE: Population health researchers have only recently begun to consider intersectionality in their theories and measurement (Bowleg, 2012), and have been hindered by the challenges of measuring and analyzing experiences of discrimination in intersectional ways. We need new methodological strategies to enable empirical research to catch up with theoretical advances.CONCLUSIONS: The pair of articles in this issue by Scheim and Bauer (2019), and Bauer and Scheim (2019), offer important new data collection instruments and data analytic strategies to advance our ability to measure discrimination intersectionally. When using these new tools, it is important to not lose track of the origins and historical underpinnings of intersectionality and to focus on the transformative goal of intersectionality to eradicate inequality.","['Evaluation Studies as Topic', 'Health Status Disparities', 'Humans']",30733077,"[['E05.337', 'N05.715.360.335'], ['I01.240.425.675', 'N01.224.425.437', 'N06.850.505.400.425.675'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400']]","['Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Organisms [B]']",0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0

Recent surgical treatments for urinary stone disease in a Korean population: National population-based study.,"OBJECTIVES: To provide surgical treatment trends for urinary stone disease in Korea.METHODS: We analyzed medical service claim data of surgical treatments to urinary stone disease submitted by medical service providers from the Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service from 2009 to 2016.RESULTS: There was a significantly increasing trend among outpatients and inpatients for urinary stone disease from 2009 to 2016 (R2  = 0.643, P = 0.017; R2  = 0.575, P = 0.029). The number of shock wave lithotripsy for treating urinary stone disease increased by 16% from 89 553 in 2009 to 104 013 in 2016 (R2  = 0.684). The number of ureteroscopic lithotripsy increased by 97% from 6106 in 2009 to 12 057 in 2016 (R2  = 0.99). The number of flexible ureteroscopic lithotripsy increased by 16-fold from 219 in 2009 to 3712 in 2016 (R2  = 0.756). The number of percutaneous nephrolithotomy increased by 99.7% from 919 in 2009 to 1835 in 2016 (R2  = 0.987). The use of non-contrast and contrast-enhanced computed tomography in the diagnostic codes for urinary stone disease increased by 394.8% and 263.3% from 2009 to 2016, respectively (R2  = 0.83; R2  = 0.967). Conversely, the use of intravenous pyelography decreased 26.2% over the same period (R2  = 0.945).CONCLUSIONS: Outpatient and inpatient procedures for urinary stone disease have increased over the past 8 years in Korea. Shock wave lithotripsy is the most widely used treatment modality for urinary stone disease, and endoscopic surgical procedures are rapidly being implemented. There has been a steep increase in the use of computed tomography, whereas conventional intravenous pyelography is declining.","['Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Linear Models', 'Lithotripsy', 'Male', 'Nephrolithotomy, Percutaneous', 'Republic of Korea', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Ureteroscopy', 'Urolithiasis']",30803067,"[['E05.318.372.500.875', 'N05.715.360.330.500.875', 'N06.850.520.450.500.875'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E05.318.740.500.500', 'E05.318.740.750.425', 'E05.599.835.750', 'N05.715.360.750.530.460', 'N05.715.360.750.695.460', 'N06.850.520.830.500.500', 'N06.850.520.830.750.425'], ['E02.600', 'E04.943.500'], ['E04.502.250.520.790', 'E04.950.774.638'], ['Z01.252.474.557.750'], ['E01.789.800', 'N04.761.559.590.800', 'N05.715.360.575.575.800'], ['E01.370.388.250.920', 'E01.370.390.800', 'E04.502.250.920', 'E04.950.774.840'], ['C12.777.967', 'C13.351.968.967']]","['Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Diseases [C]']",0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1
The effects of antigen dose and adjuvant on the antibody response; amplification of restricted B cell clones.,"Anti-DNP antibody production in inbred strain 2 guinea pigs immunized with chemically defined DNP-oligolysines was enhanced by increasing the antigen dose or employing more potent adjuvants. However, the increase in antibody titer was not accompanied by an increase in antibody heterogeneity. Only a small number of anti-DNP antibody-producing B lymphocyte clones were triggered to produce antibody, regardless of the antigen dose or the adjuvant used for immunization or the resulting specific antibody titer. This restricted response occurred despirte the capacity of these animals to synthesize a large number of distinct anti-DNP antibodies and of DNP-oligolysines to bind all these antibodies. These observations are inconsistent with the hypothesis that adjuvant and increased antigen dose enhance antibody titer by recruitment of more diverse precursor B cells (clonal recruitment), but support the hypothesis that adjuvant and increased antigen dose act by enhancing the expansion of a restricted few B lymphocyte clones (clonal expansion).","['Adjuvants, Immunologic', 'Animals', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Formation', 'Antigens', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'BCG Vaccine', 'Clone Cells', 'Cross Reactions', ""Freund's Adjuvant"", 'Guinea Pigs', 'Immunization', 'Isoelectric Focusing', 'Mycobacterium bovis', 'Nitrobenzenes', 'Polylysine', 'Time Factors']",774983,"[['D27.505.696.477.067'], ['B01.050'], ['D12.776.124.486.485.114', 'D12.776.124.790.651.114', 'D12.776.377.715.548.114'], ['G12.450.050.370.250'], ['D23.050'], ['A11.063.438', 'A11.118.637.555.567.562', 'A15.145.229.637.555.567.562', 'A15.382.032.438', 'A15.382.490.555.567.562'], ['D20.215.894.135.825.100'], ['A11.251.353'], ['G12.122.281'], ['D20.475'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.550'], ['E02.095.465.425.400', 'E05.478.550', 'N02.421.726.758.310', 'N06.850.780.200.425', 'N06.850.780.680.310'], ['E05.196.401.663', 'E05.301.300.663'], ['B03.510.024.962.500.402', 'B03.510.460.400.410.552.552.402'], ['D02.455.426.559.389.565', 'D02.640.529'], ['D12.125.068.555.750', 'D12.125.095.647.750', 'D12.644.760'], ['G01.910.857']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

Surface antibacterial properties of resin and resin-modified dental cements.,"OBJECTIVE: Cements possessing antibacterial properties may reduce bacteria-induced fixed partial denture complications. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the antibacterial properties of 4 dental cements using the direct contact test (DCT) and the agar diffusion test (ADT).METHOD AND MATERIALS: The ADT was performed using mitis salivarius agar plates. Each plate was evenly inoculated with freshly grown mutans streptococci. Two samples of each test material-RelyX ARC, Variolink II, GC FujiCEM, and Principle-were placed, and the inhibition halo obtained was measured after 48 hours. For the DCT, 8 samples were placed on the sidewalls of wells in a 96-well microtiter plate. After polymerization, freshly grown Streptococcus mutans cells (1 X 10(6)) were placed on the surface of each sample for 1 hour at 37 degrees C. Fresh medium was then added to each well, and bacterial growth was followed for 16 hours in a temperature-controlled spectrophotometer. Similarly prepared samples were aged in phosphate-buffered saline for 1 or 7 days and the DCT was repeated. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey multiple comparisons were applied to the data.RESULTS: In the ADT, GC FujiCEM showed an inhibition zone of 2.0 +/- 0.3 mm, and Principle showed an inhibition zone of 1.2 +/- 0.2 mm.

Single-dose and multiple-dose pharmacokinetics and dose proportionality of intravenous and intramuscular HPâCD-diclofenac (Dyloject) compared with other diclofenac formulations.,"STUDY OBJECTIVE: To evaluate single- and repeated-dose pharmacokinetics (PK) and dose proportionality of hydroxypropyl-â-cyclodextrin (HPâCD)-diclofenac compared with Voltarol after intravenous (IV) and intramuscular (IM) administration.DESIGN: Study 1: Single-dose randomized four-way crossover study. Study 2: Multiple-dose randomized three-way crossover study.SETTING: Clinical research center.SUBJECTS: Healthy adult volunteers.INTERVENTION: Study 1: Subjects received HPâCD-diclofenac and Voltarol, IV and IM, with a 5-day washout between treatment periods. Study 2: Subjects received two doses of IV HPâCD-diclofenac and oral Cataflam once every 6 hours for four doses with a 48-hour washout period between treatment periods.MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Study 1: IV HPâCD-diclofenac had a higher peak plasma concentration (Cmax ) and earlier time to reach maximum plasma concentration (Tmax ), but equivalent plasma exposure (area under the curve from time zero to t [AUC0-t ]) to IV Voltarol. The geometric mean ratio of HPâCD-diclofenac (IV) to Voltarol (IV) for AUC0-t was 106.27%. The geometric mean ratio of HPâCD-diclofenac (IM) to Voltarol (IM) for AUC0-t was 110.91%. The geometric mean ratio of HPâCD-diclofenac (IV) to HPâCD-diclofenac (IM) for AUC0-t was 101.25%. The geometric mean ratio of HPâCD-diclofenac (IM) to Voltarol (IV) for AUC0-t was 104.96%. Study 2: Cmax for diclofenac was 2904 and 6031 ng/ml after the first IV dose of 18.75 and 37.5 mg HPâCD-diclofenac, respectively, and was 3090 and 5617 ng/ml after the fourth dose, indicating no accumulation. Plasma exposures to 18.75 mg (866 ng·hour/ml) and 37.5 mg (1843 ng·hour/ml) IV HPâCD-diclofenac bracketed that of oral Cataflam 50 mg (1473 ng·hour/ml).CONCLUSIONS: Study 1: Bioavailability in terms of AUC after IV administration was equivalent for HPâCD-diclofenac compared with Voltarol and after IM administration of HPâCD-diclofenac and Voltarol. Bioavailability in terms of AUC after IM administration of HPâCD-diclofenac was equivalent to IV administration of HPâCD-diclofenac and IV administration of Voltarol. Study 2: HPâCD-diclofenac showed dose proportionality after single- and multiple-dose administration and no accumulation of HPâCD-diclofenac.

The value of treatment planning using CT and an immobilizing shell in radiotherapy for paranasal sinus carcinomas.,"This article describes a method which uses CT scans and immobilizing shells radiation treatment planning (CT-assisted planning) for paranasal sinus carcinomas and the value of this method on the treatment outcome. Results of the treatment for 82 patients who had CT-assisted planning were compared with that of 88 patients who had no such treatment planning. It has been concluded that the combined use of CT and the shell in treatment planning permitted a 3-dimensional localization of both the tumor and critical normal structures with great accuracy, leading to an improved long-term survival and a reduced complication rate. The multivariate regression analysis for predicting significant prognostic factors also confirmed the valuable role of CT in terms of survival and primary tumor control. The actuarial 5-year survival rate was 51% in all patients, whereas, by using CT-assisted planning, it was improved to 61%. The improved survival was observed among the patients with tumors of the suprastructures where tumors were located adjacent to the critical organs (brain and eye). Major complications attributable to radiation have included instances of brain and ocular damage. CT-assisted planning, however, has been proven effective in avoiding brain necrosis and preserving eye sight.","['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immobilization', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Paranasal Sinus Neoplasms', 'Prognosis', 'Radiotherapy Planning, Computer-Assisted', 'Radiotherapy, Computer-Assisted', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed']",2912946,"[['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['M01.060.116.100.080'], ['C04.557.470.200.400', 'C04.557.470.700.400'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E05.472'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['C04.588.443.665.650.693', 'C08.460.669.693', 'C08.460.692.503', 'C08.785.600.693', 'C09.603.669.693', 'C09.603.692.503', 'C09.647.685.693'], ['E01.789'], ['E02.950.825', 'L01.313.500.750.100.710.600.608'], ['E02.815.635', 'L01.313.500.750.100.710.600'], ['E01.370.350.350.810', 'E01.370.350.600.350.700.810', 'E01.370.350.700.700.810', 'E01.370.350.700.810.810', 'E01.370.350.825.810.810']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Information Science [L]']",0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0
[Chondroma adjacent to Meckel's cave mimicking a fifth cranial nerve neurinoma. A case report].,"Cranial chondromas are tumours arising from chondrocyte embryonic remnants cells that usually appear in the skull base synchondrosis. In contrast to the rest of the organism, where chondroid tumours are the most common primary bone tumour just behind the haematopoietic lineage ones, they are a rarity at cranial level, with an incidence of less than 1% of intracranial tumours. The case is reported on a 42 year-old male referred to our clinic due to the finding of an extra-axial lesion located close to the Meckel's cave region, with extension to the posterior fossa and brainstem compression after progressive paraparesis of 6 months onset. With the diagnosis of trigeminal schwannoma, a subtotal tumour resection was performed using a combined supra-infratentorial pre-sigmoidal approach. The postoperative histopathology report confirmed the diagnosis of cranial chondroma.","['Adult', 'Chondroma', 'Cranial Nerve Neoplasms', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Neurilemmoma', 'Skull Base', 'Skull Neoplasms', 'Trigeminal Nerve Diseases']",26944382,"[['M01.060.116'], ['C04.557.450.565.265'], ['C04.588.614.300', 'C04.588.614.596.240', 'C10.292.225', 'C10.551.360', 'C10.551.775.250'], ['E01.171'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C04.557.465.625.650.595', 'C04.557.580.600.610.595', 'C04.557.580.625.650.595'], ['A01.456.830', 'A02.835.232.781.750'], ['C04.588.149.721', 'C05.116.231.754'], ['C07.465.299.625.500', 'C10.292.319.625.700']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
"Precise diagnosis of infection in burn wound biopsy specimens. Combination of histologic technique, acridine orange staining, and culture.","This study developed a rapid manual histologic technique on burn wound biopsy specimens for an early diagnosis of infection. A total of 86 biopsy specimens were processed using this rapid manual method, acridine orange fluorescent staining for the detection of microorganisms, and a quantitative culture for the identification and counting of bacteria in adjacent homogenized biopsy specimens. Use of these three techniques has shown their complementarity for the evaluation of sepsis in burn wound patients. The histologic study allowed a classification of the depth of bacterial involvement 4 hours after specimen collection, whereas the acridine orange fluorescent staining was useful for quantitative evaluation of infection in the same delay. Thus a rapid therapeutic decision can be made while waiting for the results of quantitative culture and sensitivity tests, which require 24 to 48 hours. We propose routine monitoring of burned patients consisting of these three tests performed simultaneously on each biopsy specimen.","['Acridine Orange', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Biopsy', 'Burns', 'Histological Techniques', 'Humans', 'Staining and Labeling', 'Time Factors', 'Wound Infection']",2473075,"[['D03.633.300.046.250.150'], ['C01.150.252'], ['E01.370.225.500.384.100', 'E01.370.225.998.054', 'E01.370.388.100', 'E04.074', 'E05.200.500.384.100', 'E05.200.998.054', 'E05.242.384.100'], ['C26.200'], ['E01.370.225.750', 'E05.200.750'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E01.370.225.500.620.670', 'E01.370.225.750.600.670', 'E05.200.500.620.670', 'E05.200.750.600.670'], ['G01.910.857'], ['C01.947']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

[Myelinization of the optic nerve in the albino mouse (the Agnes Bluhm Jena-Halle strain)].,"Knowledge of normal differentiations is indispensable for interpreting developmental disturbances in animal experiments. Accordingly, the investigations described in the present paper were aimed at explaining the process of myelinization of the optic nerve in the domestic mouse breed Agnes Bluhm Jena-Halle. First signs of myelin sheath formation can be seen on the sixth and seventh day post partum. The myelin sheath grew considerably up to the 20th day of life; under light microscopic examination this process was seen to end on approximately the 30th day post partum. Electron-microscopic examination provided proof that myelinization is effected by the oligodendrocytes. This process of differentiation continues even in the adult animal, though on a very small scale.","['Animals', 'Astrocytes', 'Axons', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Myelin Sheath', 'Oligodendroglia', 'Optic Nerve']",6645270,"[['B01.050'], ['A08.637.200', 'A11.650.200'], ['A08.675.542.145', 'A11.284.180.075', 'A11.671.137', 'A11.671.501.145'], ['G04.152'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500'], ['B01.050.050.199.520.520', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500.400'], ['E01.370.350.515.402', 'E05.595.402'], ['A08.637.600.500', 'A08.637.800.500', 'A08.675.542.512.560', 'A08.800.800.690.500', 'A10.755.503', 'A11.284.149.165.600', 'A11.650.600.500', 'A11.650.800.500', 'A11.671.501.512.560', 'A11.671.514.553'], ['A08.637.600', 'A11.650.600'], ['A08.800.800.120.680']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Pre-admission education in surgical rheumatology nursing: towards greater patient empowerment.,"AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: This study compared the pre-admission education received by two groups of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients scheduled for hip arthroplasty. The specific aim was to compare these patients' knowledge about care-related issues and sense of certainty about that knowledge, empowering learning experience, length of admission discussion, length of hospital stay and number of health problems.BACKGROUND: Previous studies have shown that surgical pre-admission education is beneficial, but there is no evidence on the relative effectiveness of different methods of education.DESIGN: We used a pre-post-test design with two groups of surgical RA patients (Group I pre-admission education via telephone and standard written educational material, n = 29; Group II standard written educational material, n = 30).METHODS: The data were collected with previously used instruments (OPKQ, MEQ), and demographic and clinical variables were asked.RESULTS: The mean score for knowledge about care-related issues and sense of certainty about that knowledge for Group I and for Group II showed no statistically significant differences at baseline and at admission. At discharge, however, a significant difference was seen between the scores--in favour of Group II. On the other hand, patients in Group I were found to be more empowered in all areas than patients in Group II.CONCLUSIONS: Written educational material seems to be a good choice for pre-admission patient education compared with telephone counselling, particularly when patients are knowledgeable about care-related issues before admission. However, education via telephone is experienced by patients as more empowering than written educational material.RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: To increase patient's knowledge written educational material can be recommended for use, but to increase patient's empowerment telephone education is better.","['Aged', 'Arthroplasty, Replacement, Hip', 'Chi-Square Distribution', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', ""Nurse's Role"", 'Osteoarthritis, Hip', 'Patient Education as Topic', 'Patient Satisfaction', 'Perioperative Nursing', 'Power, Psychological', 'Preoperative Care', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Statistics, Nonparametric']",21040004,"[['M01.060.116.100'], ['E04.555.110.110.110', 'E04.650.110.110', 'E04.680.101.110.110'], ['E05.318.740.994.300', 'G17.820.300', 'N05.715.360.750.750.200', 'N06.850.520.830.994.300'], ['E05.318.372.500.750', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750'], ['F01.100.150.500', 'N05.300.150.410'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['F01.829.316.616.625.450', 'N05.300.100.337'], ['C05.550.114.606.400', 'C05.799.613.400'], ['I02.233.332.500', 'N02.421.726.407.680'], ['F01.100.150.750.625', 'F01.145.488.887.625', 'N04.452.822.700', 'N05.300.150.800.625', 'N05.715.360.600'], ['E02.760.731.500', 'H02.478.676.650', 'N02.421.533.710', 'N02.421.585.722.500'], ['F01.658.780'], ['E02.760.795', 'E04.604.750', 'N02.421.585.795'], ['E05.318.370.725', 'E05.337.851', 'N05.715.360.325.685', 'N06.850.520.445.725'], ['E05.318.740.995', 'N05.715.360.750.760', 'N06.850.520.830.995']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]']",0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0
Promotion of activated human B cell apoptosis and inhibition of Ig production by soluble CD95 ligand: CD95-based downregulation of Ig production need not culminate in activated B cell death.,"CD95/CD95L interactions are vital to normal lymphoid homeostasis and in the protection against autoimmunity. To directly assess the effects of CD95L on activated B cell survival and Ig responses, purified human peripheral blood B cells, activated in vitro with SAC + rIL2, were incubated with a soluble CD95L fusion protein (fp) and assayed for apoptosis and IgG/IgM production. CD95L fp reproducibly increased apoptosis of these activated B cells and inhibited their Ig production. However, CD95L fp-mediated effects on activated B cell survival could be uncoupled from those on Ig production in that a soluble CD40L fp was incapable of reversing CD95L fp-mediated downregulation of Ig responses despite inhibiting CD95L fp-mediated apoptosis. Moreover, despite the specific caspase-8 inhibitor z-IETD-fmk substantially protecting transformed CL-01 B cells from CD95L fp-mediated apoptosis and permitting their ongoing proliferation, caspase-8 inhibition had no protective effects on CD95L fp-mediated inhibition of constitutive IgM production by CL-01 B cells. Collectively, these results point to a CD95-based downregulatory pathway in activated B cells that need not necessarily culminate in their death.","['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase', 'ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1', 'Annexin A5', 'Antigens, CD', 'Antigens, CD20', 'Antigens, Differentiation', 'Apoptosis', 'B-Lymphocyte Subsets', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Cell Separation', 'Cell Survival', 'Down-Regulation', 'Fas Ligand Protein', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulins', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Membrane Glycoproteins', 'NAD+ Nucleosidase', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins', 'Solubility', 'fas Receptor']",10915556,"[['D08.811.277.450.430.400.060', 'D08.811.913.400.725.115.660.060'], ['D08.811.277.450.430.400.060.500', 'D12.776.543.550.045'], ['D12.776.157.125.050.100'], ['D23.050.301.264.035', 'D23.101.100.110'], ['D23.050.301.264.035.120', 'D23.050.301.264.051.120', 'D23.101.100.110.120', 'D23.101.100.150.120'], ['D23.050.301.264', 'D23.101.100'], ['G04.146.954.035'], ['A11.063.438.450', 'A11.118.637.555.567.550.450', 'A11.118.637.555.567.562.200', 'A15.145.229.637.555.567.550.450', 'A15.145.229.637.555.567.562.200', 'A15.382.032.438.450', 'A15.382.490.555.567.550.300', 'A15.382.490.555.567.562.450'], ['A11.063.438', 'A11.118.637.555.567.562', 'A15.145.229.637.555.567.562', 'A15.382.032.438', 'A15.382.490.555.567.562'], ['E01.370.225.500.363', 'E05.200.500.363', 'E05.242.363'], ['G04.346'], ['G02.111.240', 'G05.308.200', 'G07.690.773.937'], ['D12.644.276.374.750.249', 'D12.776.395.550.312', 'D12.776.467.374.750.249', 'D12.776.543.550.312', 'D23.529.374.750.249'], ['G05.308'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D12.776.124.486.485', 'D12.776.124.790.651', 'D12.776.377.715.548'], ['E01.370.225.812.482', 'E05.200.812.482', 'E05.478.594.530', 'G12.450.050.400.545', 'G12.565'], ['D12.776.395.550', 'D12.776.543.550'], ['D08.811.277.450.430.400', 'D08.811.913.400.725.115.660'], ['D12.776.828.300'], ['G02.805'], ['D12.776.543.750.690.500', 'D12.776.543.750.705.852.760.195']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Detection and discrimination of Shigella sonnei and Shigella flexneri based on vacuolar responses in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.,"This study provided a system for bacteria detection based on a lysosome-like-vacuole response in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Vacuoles are factors known to activate the immune system in the presence of foreign substances. Here, Shigella sonnei and Shigella flexneri were exposed to yeast to analyze the alteration of vacuolar enzymes. The ability to detect the bacteria was evaluated by confocal microscopy after exposing and staining vacuoles with LysoTracker. Results showed that the treatment of yeast with these bacteria increased the number of red vacuole-like organelles surrounding yeast nuclei. Thus, vacuole alteration can be used as a biomarker for bacteria detection. Next, the expression of vacuolar enzymes under the influence of bacteria was examined using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) method for screening specific biomarkers for each Shigella strain. Finally, the recombinant yeasts that contained biomarkers fused to different fluorescent proteins confirmed the ability of yeast to detect these two Shigella strains at concentrations ranging from 10 to 100 CFU/mL.","['Amines', 'Bacterial Proteins', 'Bacterial Typing Techniques', 'Biomarkers', 'Colony Count, Microbial', 'Electrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional', 'Fluorescent Dyes', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae', 'Shigella flexneri', 'Shigella sonnei', 'Vacuoles']",30261194,"[['D02.092'], ['D12.776.097'], ['E01.370.225.875.150.125', 'E05.200.875.150.125'], ['D23.101'], ['E01.370.225.875.220', 'E05.200.875.220'], ['E05.196.401.250', 'E05.301.300.230'], ['D27.720.233.348', 'D27.720.470.410.505.500'], ['E01.370.350.515.395', 'E05.595.395'], ['B01.300.107.795.785.800', 'B01.300.930.705.655'], ['B03.440.450.425.850.450', 'B03.660.250.150.730.210'], ['B03.440.450.425.850.800', 'B03.660.250.150.730.710'], ['A11.284.430.214.190.875.190.920']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Access to care for patients with time-sensitive conditions in Pennsylvania.,"STUDY OBJECTIVE: Collective knowledge and coordination of vital interventions for time-sensitive conditions (ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction [STEMI], stroke, cardiac arrest, and septic shock) could contribute to a comprehensive statewide emergency care system, but little is known about population access to the resources required. We seek to describe existing clinical management strategies for time-sensitive conditions in Pennsylvania hospitals.METHODS: All Pennsylvania emergency departments (EDs) open in 2009 were surveyed about resource availability and practice patterns for time-sensitive conditions. The frequency with which EDs provided essential clinical bundles for each condition was assessed. Penalized maximum likelihood regressions were used to evaluate associations between ED characteristics and the presence of the 4 clinical bundles of care. We used geographic information science to calculate 60-minute ambulance access to the nearest facility with these clinical bundles.RESULTS: The percentage of EDs providing each of the 4 clinical bundles in 2009 ranged from 20% to 57% (stroke 20%, STEMI 32%, cardiac arrest 34%, sepsis 57%). For STEMI and stroke, presence of a board-certified/board-eligible emergency physician was significantly associated with presence of a clinical bundle. Only 8% of hospitals provided all 4 care bundles. However, 53% of the population was able to reach this minority of hospitals within 60 minutes.CONCLUSION: Reliably matching patient needs to ED resources in time-dependent illness is a critical component of a coordinated emergency care system. Population access to critical interventions for the time-dependent diseases discussed here is limited. A population-based planning approach and improved coordination of care could improve access to interventions for patients with time-sensitive conditions.","['Adult', 'Child', 'Emergency Service, Hospital', 'Health Care Surveys', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Heart Arrest', 'Humans', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Patient Care Bundles', 'Pennsylvania', 'Shock, Septic', 'Stroke', 'Time Factors']",24368055,"[['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.406'], ['N02.278.216.500.968.336', 'N02.421.297.195', 'N04.452.442.452.422.336'], ['E05.318.308.980.344', 'N03.349.380.210', 'N05.425.210', 'N05.715.360.300.800.344', 'N06.850.520.308.980.344'], ['N04.590.374.350', 'N05.300.430'], ['C14.280.383'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C14.280.647.500', 'C14.907.585.500', 'C23.550.513.355.750', 'C23.550.717.489.750'], ['E02.765'], ['Z01.107.567.875.075.550', 'Z01.107.567.875.350.550', 'Z01.107.567.875.500.550'], ['C01.757.800', 'C23.550.470.790.500.800', 'C23.550.835.900.712'], ['C10.228.140.300.775', 'C14.907.253.855'], ['G01.910.857']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1
[Clinical and echocardiographic study of mitral valve in children with severe rheumatic carditis. Aspects of prolapse or rupture].,"PURPOSE: To describe cases of rheumatic carditis with echocardiographic aspects of prolapse or rupture of mitral structures.METHODS: We described 16 cases of acute carditis (ages between 5-15 years). In 10 (group 1) there was aspect of mitral prolapse, in 6 (group 2) aspect of ""flail"". The measurements of anterior chordae and anuli were compared to the ones of 5 cases of chronic rheumatic fever with dilated left ventricle and aortic regurgitation (group 3) and to 20 normal children of same ages. The same measurements were repeated after treatment.RESULTS: The mean of the measurements in group 1 was; 26.48 +/- 11.46mm-anterior chordae; 32.13 +/- 7.35mm anuli; in the group 2 was respectively 29.63 +/- 4.57mm and 35.63 +/- 7 mm. In the group 3 anterior chordae was 34.52 +/- 6.8mm, anuli: 34.8 +/- 4.61 mm. In the normal group, respectively was: 18.19 +/- 4.26mm and 24.66 +/- 2.85mm. After corticosteroid many cases improved. In the statistical analyses, the measurements among patients of group 1 and 2 compared to normal children, the difference was significant but it was not compared to group 3. Comparing the measurements pre and post treatment the decrease was not significant.CONCLUSION: The acute carditis in these cases lead to significant elongation of anterior chordae and dilatation of anuli, but there was not a significant decrease after treatment.","['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chordae Tendineae', 'Female', 'Heart Rupture', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mitral Valve', 'Mitral Valve Prolapse', 'Myocarditis', 'Prospective Studies', 'Rheumatic Heart Disease', 'Ultrasonography']",8762688,"[['C23.550.291.125'], ['M01.060.057'], ['M01.060.406'], ['M01.060.406.448'], ['A07.541.510.240'], ['C14.280.470'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['A07.541.510.507'], ['C14.280.484.400.500'], ['C14.280.238.625'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.625', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.650', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.650'], ['C01.150.252.410.890.731.649', 'C14.280.874'], ['E01.370.350.850']]","['Diseases [C]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]']",1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
The dispersion of Echinococcus granulosus in the intestine of dogs.,"We studied the dispersion of adult Echinococcus granulosus in the intestine of experimentally infected dogs at 2 scales of habitat use. On a coarse scale, worms were found most frequently in the anterior third of the small intestine. On a fine scale, clumps or aggregations, typically of 4-5 worms in an area of 12 mm2, occurred throughout the anterior two-thirds of the intestine. The most likely proximate cause of aggregative behavior is attraction between individual worms. There are at least 2 equally plausible ultimate causes of the behavior: to enhance cross-fertilization and to improve the quality of the environment. Restriction of worms to the anterior small intestine may be a consequence of aggregative behavior on a finer scale or a response to different proximate and ultimate factors.","['Animals', 'Dogs', 'Echinococcus', 'Feces', 'Female', 'Intestine, Small', 'Intestines', 'Male', 'Parasite Egg Count']",2760768,"[['B01.050'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.750.250.216.200'], ['B01.050.500.500.736.215.327'], ['A12.459'], ['A03.556.124.684'], ['A03.556.124'], ['E01.370.225.932.600', 'E05.200.932.600']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

[Neuroimaging diagnosis and therapeutic efficacy of different surgical methods of gliomatosis cerebri].,"OBJECTIVE: To explore the neuroimaging diagnosis and therapeutic efficacy of different surgical methods of gliomatosis cerebri.METHODS: 26 cases of gliomatosis cerebri at our department between September 2008 and September 2013 were retrospectively analyzed. Preoperative cranial computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and other multimodal imaging scans were performed. The procedures included stereotactic brain biopsy (n = 11) and large craniotomy lobotomy (n = 15). Whole brain radiotherapy and/or temozolomide therapy was performed postoperatively according to the malignancy of tumors. Follow-ups were conducted to analyze the survival differences between stereotactic brain biopsy and large craniotomy lobotomy groups.RESULTS: According to the different features of multimodal imaging, gliomatosis cerebri could be divided into two types: (1) type I(n = 19) showed a diffuse infiltrating lesion infringing multiple brain lobes or regions with central corpus callosum but without obvious enhancement; (2) type II (n = 7) appeared as sporadic or tuberous enhancement in addition to the features of type I. Pathological diagnosis: pilocytic astrocytoma (n = 2), diffuse astrocytoma (n = 13), oligodendroglial tumors (n = 3), oligoastrocytoma (n = 1), anaplastic astrocytoma (n = 5) and glioblastoma (n = 2). The degree of malignancy was a prognostic factor for postoperative survival in patients with gliomatosis cerebri. The mean survival time (MST) of large craniotomy lobotomy group (23 ± 7) was significantly longer than that of stereotactic brain biopsy group (13 ± 3) (P < 0.05).CONCLUSION: Gliomatosis cerebri is a primary brain glial tumor with diffuse infiltrative growth but retaining the general structure of central nervous system. Multimodal imaging studies plus pathological examination yield a definitive diagnosis. Comprehensive treatment of operation plus chemo- or radio-therapy can prolong postoperative MST.","['Biopsy', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Glioma', 'Humans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Neuroimaging', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed']",25152287,"[['E01.370.225.500.384.100', 'E01.370.225.998.054', 'E01.370.388.100', 'E04.074', 'E05.200.500.384.100', 'E05.200.998.054', 'E05.242.384.100'], ['C04.588.614.250.195', 'C10.228.140.211', 'C10.551.240.250'], ['C04.557.465.625.600.380', 'C04.557.470.670.380', 'C04.557.580.625.600.380'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E01.370.350.825.500'], ['E01.370.350.578', 'E01.370.376.537', 'E05.629'], ['E05.318.372.500.500.500', 'E05.318.372.500.750.750', 'N05.715.360.330.500.500.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.825', 'N06.850.520.450.500.500.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.825'], ['E01.370.350.350.810', 'E01.370.350.600.350.700.810', 'E01.370.350.700.700.810', 'E01.370.350.700.810.810', 'E01.370.350.825.810.810']]","['Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Health Care [N]']",0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
Interstitial cystitis patients' use and rating of complementary and alternative medicine therapies.,"INTRODUCTION AND HYPOTHESIS: The purpose of this study was to describe the use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) therapies among interstitial cystitis (IC) patients, patients' perception of CAM therapies' effectiveness, and the association of time since diagnosis with perceived effectiveness of these therapies.METHODS: In April 2009, the Interstitial Cystitis Association (ICA) initiated an Internet-based survey on CAM. Respondents indicated whether they received an IC diagnosis and how long ago, whether they tried CAM, and who recommended it. On a 5-point scale, respondents rated 49 therapies. For respondents confirming a diagnosis, we used a chi-square goodness-of-fit test to assess which therapies were rated positively or negatively by a majority of patients who tried them. Using separate one-way analyses of variance, we assessed differences in mean perceived effectiveness among groups based on time since diagnosis and conducted post hoc tests, if necessary. Using chi-square tests, we explored the association of time since diagnosis with the use of CAM and the number of therapies tried.RESULTS: A total of 2,101 subjects responded to the survey; 1,982 confirmed an IC diagnosis. Most (84.2 %) had tried CAM, and 55 % said physicians had recommended CAM. Of those trying CAM, 82.8 % had tried diet or physical therapy and 69.2 % other therapies. Of the therapies, 22 were rated positively and 20 negatively; 7 were inconclusive. Therapies patients perceived to be helpful included dietary management and pain management adjuncts such as physical therapy, heat and cold, meditation and relaxation, acupuncture, stress reduction, exercise, and sleep hygiene. Many therapies worked better for those diagnosed recently than for those diagnosed long before.CONCLUSIONS: Randomized, placebo-controlled studies are needed to demonstrate which therapies may indeed control IC symptoms and help send research in new and productive directions.","['Acupuncture', 'Complementary Therapies', 'Cystitis, Interstitial', 'Data Collection', 'Diet Therapy', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Perception', 'Physical Therapy Modalities', 'Treatment Outcome']",23149598,"[['H02.004'], ['E02.190'], ['C12.777.829.495.500', 'C13.351.968.829.495.500'], ['E05.318.308', 'L01.399.250', 'N05.715.360.300', 'N06.850.520.308'], ['E02.642.249'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['F02.463.593'], ['E02.779', 'E02.831.535'], ['E01.789.800', 'N04.761.559.590.800', 'N05.715.360.575.575.800']]","['Disciplines and Occupations [H]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]']",0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0
[Role of sera from peptic ulcer patients in cell proliferation of human gastric carcinoma].,"This study aimed at the relationship of helicobacter pylori infection to gastric carcinoma pathogenesis. Forty-nine serum samples from patients with gastric and duodenal ulcer and 20 serum sample from normal subjects were collected for the assessment of serum gastrin by radioimmunoassay (RIA) and serum IgG, IgA and IgM antibodies against H. pylori by ELISA respectively. The patients, serum samples were divided into four groups for observations on whether the sera would affect the cell proliferation of HAC803 derived from human gastric carcinoma and of HT29 from human colonic carcinoma cultured in vitro. The cell proliferation was determined by MIT assay. The results showed that the level of serogastrin in gastric and duodenal ulcer was significantly higher than that in normal control (139.6 +/- 38.17 pg/ml vs 63.12 +/- 28.7 pg/ml, P < 0.01). As for the sera of ulcer subjects, the highest anti-HpIgG group (group A) and the highest anti-Hp IgA group (group B) displayed a significantly enhanced cell proliferation of human gastric carcinoma (P < 0.05), especially group B. But all the four groups had less significant increase in cell proliferation of human colonic carcinoma (P > 0.05). These findings indicate that, in the highest anti-HpIgG group and the highest IgA group of the peptic ulcer subjects infected by H. pylori, the sera can enhance cell proliferation of gastric carcinoma, however the role is less associated with serum gastrin.","['Antibodies, Bacterial', 'Cell Division', 'Duodenal Ulcer', 'Helicobacter Infections', 'Helicobacter pylori', 'Humans', 'Stomach Neoplasms', 'Stomach Ulcer', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",12212290,"[['D12.776.124.486.485.114.107', 'D12.776.124.790.651.114.125', 'D12.776.377.715.548.114.125'], ['G04.144.220', 'G04.161.750.500', 'G05.113', 'G07.345.249.410.750.500'], ['C06.405.469.275.800.348', 'C06.405.748.586.349'], ['C01.150.252.400.466'], ['B03.440.500.550', 'B03.660.150.235.500.250.550'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C04.588.274.476.767', 'C06.301.371.767', 'C06.405.249.767', 'C06.405.748.789'], ['C06.405.469.275.800.849', 'C06.405.748.586.849'], ['A11.251.860']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Diazepam kinetics in relation to age and sex.,"27 male volunteers aged 20 to 91 years, and 13 female volunteers aged 21 to 33 years, received single 5 to 10 mg doses of diazepam intravenously. Diazepam pharmacokinetics were determined from concentrations measured in multiple plasma samples drawn during 7 days after each dose. Diazepam elimination half-life among males (mean: 66 h) increased significantly with age (r = 0.53, p less than 0.005). Volume of distribution (mean: 1.39 liters/kg) also increased significantly with age (r = 0.67, p less than 0.001). Clearance of total diazepam in males (mean: 0.42 ml/min/kg) tended to decline with age (r = 0.32), but the association was of borderline significance (p = 0.1). Diazepam was extensively bound to plasma protein, with a mean free fraction among male subjects of 1.34%. Free fraction tended to increase with age (r = 0.14). Correction of volume of distribution and clearance for individual differences in binding did not alter the conclusions. Compared to young males, young females had larger volumes of distribution (1.87 vs. 1.34 liters/kg) and higher total clearance (0.63 vs. 0.49 ml/min/kg). These differences were even greater after correction for sex-related changes in protein binding. Elimination half-life did not differ between sexes. Since both age and sex can influence diazepam disposition, both should be considered as independent variables in studies of diazepam pharmacokinetics.","['Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Diazepam', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Sex Factors']",7312934,"[['M01.060.116'], ['N05.715.350.075', 'N06.850.490.250'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['D03.633.100.079.080.070.216'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['G01.374.661', 'G02.111.490'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['N05.715.350.675', 'N06.850.490.875']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
Hemiarthroplasty versus total shoulder prosthesis: results of cemented glenoid components.,"In this retrospective study, we compared the results of 705 total shoulder arthroplasties (TSAs) with 469 hemiarthroplasties (HSAs), all having been performed with the Aequalis shoulder prosthesis. Each group, both TSA and HSA, was comparable by age (mean, 63.9 years) and sex (853 men and 321 women). Each group had comparable dominance and preoperative Constant scores (mean, 29 points). The length of follow-up averaged 43 months (range, 24-110 months) in both groups. The postoperative functional outcome and subjective assessment demonstrated the superiority of TSA over HSA independent of age or rotator cuff status (Constant score, 65.7 vs 56.3 points). The analysis of the radiographs showed a disturbing 68% of cases with radiolucent lines developing around the glenoid component and their subsequent progression with time. We saw an adverse effect on functional outcome by the presence of these radiolucent lines. This review would suggest that TSA is superior to HSA in most cases with chronic pathologic entities. HSA remains a satisfactory solution in specific cases. In the future, we need to optimize the designs of the glenoid implant and develop a better implantation technique to avoid the problems associated with glenoid replacement.","['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Arthroplasty, Replacement', 'Bone Cements', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Joint Diseases', 'Joint Prosthesis', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Recovery of Function', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Rotator Cuff', 'Rotator Cuff Injuries', 'Rupture', 'Shoulder Joint', 'Treatment Outcome']",16517357,"[['M01.060.057'], ['M01.060.116'], ['N05.715.350.075', 'N06.850.490.250'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['M01.060.116.100.080'], ['E04.555.110.110', 'E04.650.110', 'E04.680.101.110'], ['D05.750.716.822.300', 'D25.720.716.822.300', 'D27.720.102.158', 'J01.637.051.720.716.822.300'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C05.550'], ['E07.695.400'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['G16.757'], ['E05.318.372.500.500.500', 'E05.318.372.500.750.750', 'N05.715.360.330.500.500.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.825', 'N06.850.520.450.500.500.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.825'], ['A02.633.567.912', 'A02.880.700'], ['C26.761.340', 'C26.803.063', 'C26.874.400'], ['C26.761'], ['A02.835.583.748'], ['E01.789.800', 'N04.761.559.590.800', 'N05.715.360.575.575.800']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0
Differential diagnosis of intraspinal and extraspinal non-discogenic sciatica.,"The aim of this study is to present a series of 11 patients with non-discogenic sciatica (NDS), and to review the diagnostic techniques of careful clinical and radiological examination. The cases include lumbar radicular herpes zoster, lumbar nerve root schwannoma, lumbar instability, facet hypertrophy, ankylosing spondylitis, sacroiliitis, sciatic neuritis, piriformis syndrome, intrapelvic mass and coxarthrosis. The pain pattern and accompanying symptoms were the major factors suggesting a non-discogenic etiology. Pelvic MRI and CT scans, and sciatic nerve magnetic resonance neurography were the main diagnostic tools for diagnosis of NDS. The treatment of choice depended on the primary diagnosis. Detailed physical examinations with special attention paid to the extraspinal causes of sciatica and to pain characteristics are the major components of differential diagnosis of NDS.","['Adult', 'Aged', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Herpes Zoster', 'Humans', 'Low Back Pain', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neurilemmoma', 'Sciatica', 'Spinal Diseases', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed']",18789864,"[['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['E01.171'], ['C01.925.256.466.930.750'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C23.888.592.612.107.400'], ['E01.370.350.825.500'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['C04.557.465.625.650.595', 'C04.557.580.600.610.595', 'C04.557.580.625.650.595'], ['C10.668.829.500.675.800', 'C10.668.829.600.800', 'C23.888.592.612.664.800'], ['C05.116.900'], ['E01.370.350.350.810', 'E01.370.350.600.350.700.810', 'E01.370.350.700.700.810', 'E01.370.350.700.810.810', 'E01.370.350.825.810.810']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]']",0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
Anti-influenza virus activity of the compound LY253963.,"The compound LY253963 (1,3,4-thiadiazol-2-ylcyanamide) inhibited the in vitro replication of representative influenza A and B viruses in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells at concentrations of 1-3.2 micrograms/ml. The yield of an influenza A (H3N2) virus in primary rhesus monkey kidney (RMK) cells was inhibited at 0.1-0.3 micrograms/ml. However, similar concentrations were inhibitory for the growth of uninfected MCDK or RMK cells. Combination drug studies generally found indifferent interactions between LY253963 and ribavirin or rimantadine. In timing of additional studies, hemagglutinin expression was inhibited to the greatest extent when LY253963 exposure was begun at least 8 h before viral infection, which suggested either slow uptake or intracellular metabolism of LY253963 to an active form. Virus-specific protein synthesis was inhibited to a greater extent by ribavirin 10 micrograms/ml or rimantadine 1 microgram/ml than by LY253963 10 micrograms/ml. No drug-resistant mutants were detected during serial passage of an influenza A (H3N2) virus in the presence of LY253963 1-16 micrograms/ml. In summary, we found that LY253963 inhibited influenza A and B virus replication in several cell types, but that it was associated with cytostatic effects at low concentrations. These studies failed to identify a selective anti-influenza action.","['Antiviral Agents', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Drug Resistance, Microbial', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Influenza A virus', 'Influenza B virus', 'Microbial Sensitivity Tests', 'Mutation', 'Nitriles', 'Orthomyxoviridae', 'RNA, Messenger', 'Thiadiazoles', 'Viral Proteins']",2080866,"[['D27.505.954.122.388'], ['A11.251'], ['G06.225', 'G07.690.773.984.269'], ['E02.319.310'], ['B04.820.480.968.405.400'], ['B04.820.480.968.407.410'], ['E01.370.225.875.595', 'E05.200.875.595', 'E05.337.550.400'], ['G05.365.590'], ['D02.626'], ['B04.820.480.968'], ['D13.444.735.544'], ['D02.886.675.867', 'D03.383.129.708.867'], ['D12.776.964']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Comparative study of effects of impact tone and steady state tone exposure: EP and concentration of K+ ion and Na+ ion.,"To test the adequacy of equal energy principle (EEP), guinea pigs were exposed to impact tone. The changes in electrophysiological data, namely endocochlear potential (EP) and the change in K+ ion and Na+ ion concentrations in the endolymph were investigated. The frequency of impact tone was 1 pulse/second or 1 pulse/3 seconds. The steady state tone had Leq24h = 100, 95, 90 or 85 dB, and impact tone had Leq24h = 95, 90 or 85 dB. The results are the following. Both steady state and impact tone exposure cause changes of electrophysiological data. The effects on the absolute value of negative EP induced by impact tone exposures were smaller than that of steady state tone of the same Leq. The rate of pulses was also an important factor for impact tone exposure. Impact tone exposure of 1 pulse/second caused smaller absolute value of negative EP than that of 1 pulse/3 seconds. The K+ ion concentration time course in the endolymph remained similar to the control (Exp. 1) only in Exp. 8 (85 dB; the lowest steady state noise exposure in our experiments), but no decrease in the K+ ion concentration was detected in the other experiments, suggesting an alteration in the K+ ion flow. The Na+ ion concentration time course was also influenced showing no increase in Na+ ion concentration compared to the control (Exp. 1c) and the lowest steady-state exposure experiment (Exp. 8c). Our experimental results suggest that both the K+ ion and Na+ ion movement are altered by tone exposure. We found also that the different types of noise exposure with the same Leq value does not exhibit the same changes. Leq24h is not an accurate damage risk criteria.","['Acoustic Stimulation', 'Animals', 'Cations, Monovalent', 'Cochlear Microphonic Potentials', 'Endolymph', 'Guinea Pigs', 'Mathematical Computing', 'Noise', 'Potassium', 'Sodium']",10587014,"[['E02.037', 'E02.190.888.030', 'E05.723.136'], ['B01.050'], ['D01.248.497.300.459'], ['G07.265.216.500.370.223', 'G07.888.250.223', 'G11.561.200.500.370.223'], ['A12.207.270.517.324'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.550'], ['L01.224.680'], ['G01.750.770.776.567', 'G16.500.275.600', 'N06.230.400', 'N06.850.460.610'], ['D01.268.549.550', 'D01.268.557.575', 'D01.552.528.652', 'D01.552.547.650'], ['D01.268.549.750', 'D01.268.557.650', 'D01.552.528.850', 'D01.552.547.725']]","['Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Health Care [N]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0
Development of sarcoidosis 6-month post discontinuation of etanercept: coincidence or real association?,"There have been numerous reports of granulomatous diseases developing in patients receiving anti-tumour necrosis factor (TNF) therapy. Herein, we report a patient who developed sarcoidosis 6 months after discontinuation of etanercept. To date, all reported cases have occurred in patients undergoing ongoing treatment with TNF blockers with resolution on its discontinuation. A 47-year-old man was diagnosed with seropositive rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in 2003. He was initially treated with methotrexate and corticosteroids. In 2005, adalimumab was added due to ongoing disease activity. However, he had persistent low-grade synovitis of bilateral wrist joints and remained oral glucocorticoids dependent. In October 2008, adalimumab was switched to etanercept with marginal benefit; however, etanercept was continued until March 2009. Rituximab was discontinued due to an immediate allergic reaction. In September 2009, he developed bilateral ankle synovitis with erythema nodosum. Further investigations (chest X-ray and CT scan of thorax) revealed new development of bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy and interstitial nodular changes typical of sarcoidosis. His baseline therapy of methotrexate was continued. His recent repeat chest X-ray and CT scan of thorax (March 2010) has shown significant spontaneous resolution of his mediastinal lymphadenopathy and pulmonary nodules. Apart from the initial brief course of NSAIDs, his sarcoidosis resolved spontaneously without requiring any further therapy. For his rheumatoid arthritis, he has been recently commenced on abatacept and his baseline therapy of methotrexate has been continued. It remains speculative as to whether the concurrence of RA and sarcoidosis is purely serendipitous, or is related to an immunodysregulatory state attributable to TNF blockade.","['Abatacept', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived', 'Antirheumatic Agents', 'Arthritis, Rheumatoid', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Etanercept', 'Humans', 'Immunoconjugates', 'Immunoglobulin G', 'Immunosuppressive Agents', 'Male', 'Methotrexate', 'Middle Aged', 'Radiography, Thoracic', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor', 'Rituximab', 'Sarcoidosis', 'Treatment Outcome']",21380931,"[['D12.776.124.790.651.114.580.225', 'D12.776.377.715.548.114.580.225'], ['D27.505.696.663.850.014.040.500', 'D27.505.954.158.030', 'D27.505.954.329.030'], ['D12.776.124.486.485.114.224.075', 'D12.776.124.790.651.114.224.075', 'D12.776.377.715.548.114.224.284'], ['D27.505.954.329'], ['C05.550.114.154', 'C05.799.114', 'C17.300.775.099', 'C20.111.199'], ['E02.319.310'], ['D12.644.541.500.697.624', 'D12.776.124.486.485.538.500.624', 'D12.776.124.486.485.680.697.624', 'D12.776.124.790.651.538.500.624', 'D12.776.124.790.651.680.660.624', 'D12.776.377.715.548.538.500.624', 'D12.776.377.715.548.680.660.624', 'D12.776.543.750.705.852.760.232'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D12.776.124.790.651.114.580', 'D12.776.377.715.548.114.580', 'D27.888.569.257'], ['D12.776.124.486.485.114.619.393', 'D12.776.124.790.651.114.619.393', 'D12.776.377.715.548.114.619.393'], ['D27.505.696.477.656'], ['D03.633.100.733.631.192.500'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['E01.370.350.700.730'], ['D12.776.543.750.705.852.760'], ['D12.776.124.486.485.114.224.075.785', 'D12.776.124.790.651.114.224.075.785', 'D12.776.377.715.548.114.224.284.785'], ['C15.604.515.827'], ['E01.789.800', 'N04.761.559.590.800', 'N05.715.360.575.575.800']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Health Care [N]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
[Effect of lncRNA HOTAIR on the radiosensitivity of HCCLM3 cells].,"Objective: To investigate the effect of down-regulating long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) and HOX transcript antisense RNA (HOTAIR) targeting miR-761 on the radiosensitivity of HCCLM3. Methods: The expression of HOTAIR in liver cancer cells HuH-7, SNU-449, HCCLM3 and normal liver cells L-02 were measured by real-time quantitative PCR. HCCLM3 cells were divided into control, Sh-NC (transfected shRNA negative control), Sh-HOTAIR (transfected HOTAIR shRNA), RAD+Sh-NC (transfected shRNA negative control and irradiated with 8Gy dose), and RAD+Sh-HOTAIR (HOTAIR shRNA was transfected and irradiated with 8Gy dose) group. Apoptosis was detected by flow cytometry, Bcl-2 Associated X Protein (Bx-2), cleaved cysteine-containing Cleaved cysteinyl aspartate specific proteinase 3 (C-Caspase-3) protein expression. Sh-NC, Sh-HOTAIR cells were irradiated with 0, 2, 4, 6, 8 Gy, and plate-clone experiments were used to determine radiosensitivity. Bioinformatics software predicted that miR-761 might be a target gene of HOTAIR, and the luciferase reporter system identified the targeting relationship. The miR-761 inhibitor, HOTAIR shRNA and inhibitor negative control, and HOTAIR shRNA were co-transfected into HCCLM3 cells, respectively. Cell apoptosis and Bax and C-cysteine-containing aspartate proteins were also measured using the above method, as well as the hydrolase-3 protein expression and cell survival fraction. Results: The expression levels of HOTAIR in liver cancer cells HuH-7, SNU-449, and HCCLM3 were higher than those in normal liver cells L-02 (1.85±0.12, 2.27±0.23, 2.68±0.15 vs 1.00±0.09, P<0.05). Compared with Sh-NC, the apoptosis rate of Sh-HOTAIR, RAD+Sh-NC cells and Bax, C-Caspase-3 protein levels are higher [Apoptotic rate: (13.47±1.32)%, (12.84±1.19)% vs (2.98±0.27)%; Bax protein: 0.74±0.08, 0.72±0.06 vs 0.42±0.06; C-Caspase-3 protein: 0.56±0.06, 0.54±0.08 vs 0.25±0.04, all P<0.05]. Compared with Sh-HOTAIR and RAD+Sh-NC, RAD+Sh-HOTAIR cell apoptosis rate and Bax, C-Caspase-3 protein levels are higher [apoptosis rate:(22.57±2.36)% vs (13.47±1.32)%, (12.84±1.19)%, Bax protein: 0.99±0.11 vs 0.74±0.08, 0.72±0.06, C-Caspase-3 protein: 1.03±0.12 vs 0.56±0.06, 0.54±0.08,all P<0.05]. Compared with Sh-NC, Sh-HOTAIR cells had lower survival scores and higher radiosensitivity (P<0.05). HOTAIR targets negative regulation of miR-761 expression. Compared with cells co-transfected with inhibitor negative control and HOTAIR shRNA, cells co-transfected with miR-761 inhibitor and HOTAIR shRNA had lower apoptosis rate after radiation treatment [(10.24±1.32)% vs (21.84±2.01))%], Bax (0.50±0.06 vs 1.01±0.10) and C-Caspase-3 protein (0.56±0.07 vs 1.05±0.14) had lower expression and higher cell survival scores (all P<0.05).

Induction of drug-metabolizing enzymes by phenobarbitone: structural and biochemical aspects.,"Two aspects of the induction of microsomal monooxygenases by phenobarbitone have been investigated. First, structural associations between mitochondria and single cisternae of rough endoplasmic reticulum (mitochondria--RER complexes) may operate as functional units in the biosynthesis of cytochrome P-450. This was deduced from (i) studies on the subcellular distribution of the phenobarbitone-induced incorporation of leucine into microsomal proteins including apocytochromes P-450 and (ii) the incorporation of labelled delta-aminolaevulinic acid into the haem prosthetic group of cytochrome P-450. Secondly, in hepatocytes from chick embryo in primary monolayer culture, induction of cytochrome P-450-haemoproteins was markedly influenced by changes in the proliferative activity of hepatocytes. Inducibility of cytochrome P-450 by phenobarbitone and by beta-naphthoflavone was decreased in cultures with 'spontaneous' or experimentally increased proliferative activity of hepatocytes. Treatment with inhibitors of DNA synthesis increased the induction response.","['Aminolevulinic Acid', 'Animals', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chick Embryo', 'Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum', 'Heme', 'Hemeproteins', 'Liver', 'Male', 'Microsomes, Liver', 'Mitochondria', 'Mixed Function Oxygenases', 'Phenobarbital', 'Rats']",6906260,"[['D02.241.755.547.276', 'D12.125.262'], ['B01.050'], ['A11.251'], ['A13.350.150', 'A16.331.200'], ['D08.244.453', 'D08.811.682.690.708.170', 'D12.776.422.220.453'], ['A11.284.430.214.190.875.248'], ['D03.383.129.578.840.500.640.587', 'D03.633.400.909.500.640.587', 'D04.345.783.500.640.587', 'D23.767.727.640.587'], ['D12.776.422'], ['A03.620'], ['A11.284.835.540.541'], ['A11.284.430.214.190.875.564', 'A11.284.835.626'], ['D08.811.682.690.708'], ['D03.383.742.698.253.650'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Electrochemical preparation of Nb2,"The present work describes the synthesis of niobium oxide nanochannels (Nb2O5NCs) with high surface area, porosity, photocurrent density, and photoelectrochemical stability as photocatalyst. The Nb2O5NCs were prepared by electrochemical anodization of niobium foil in different electrolytes: 1 M H2SO4 containing 0.4 wt% HF (S1); glycerol containing 0.4 M NH4F (S2); 0.25 g NH4F with 4 vol% water in glycol at 50 °C (S3); and glycerol containing 10 wt% K2HPO4, at 130 °C (S4, annealed in air; S5, annealed in N2). All the Nb2O5NCs showed well-organized arrays of nanochannels grown on the Nb foil, with tube diameters in the order S4<S2<S1<S3 and film thicknesses in the order S1<S2<S3<S4, as determined using FEG-SEM analyses. The samples were also characterized using XRD, EDX, DRS, XPS, EIS, Mott-Schottky analysis, and LSV curves. But, best results were obtained only when phosphorus (about 1% doping) was incorporated into the electrodes samples prepared in glycerol containing 10 wt% K2HPO4 at 130 °C (i.e. S4 and S5). This procedure enhances the absorption intensity in the UV-Vis regions, the conductivity, the charge carrier density, and the photocurrent density. The Nb2O5NC sample S5 was tested for the degradation of Procion Red HE-3B (RR120) dye, as a model pollutant, achieving efficient photoelectrodegradation with nearly 2 times higher mineralization efficiency compared to photolysis (PT) and photocatalysis (PC). Thus, the results indicate that the modification of Nb2O5NC thin film photoelectrodes by phosphorous doping can be a powerful and efficient alternative to usual approaches applied to the treatment of complex reactive dyes.","['Coloring Agents', 'Niobium', 'Organic Chemicals', 'Oxides', 'Photolysis', 'Titanium', 'Water Purification']",32480087,"[['D27.720.233'], ['D01.268.556.615', 'D01.268.956.687', 'D01.552.544.615'], ['D02'], ['D01.248.497.158.685', 'D01.650.550'], ['G02.740.685'], ['D01.268.557.800', 'D01.268.956.878', 'D01.552.547.800'], ['N06.850.780.200.800.800.900.900', 'N06.850.860.510.900.900']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Health Care [N]']",0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
Salt dependence of the formation and stability of the signaling state in G protein-coupled receptors: evidence for the involvement of the Hofmeister effect.,"We studied the salt dependence of both the stability and the equilibrium of the late photoproducts metarhodopsin I (MI) and II (MII) of the artificial visual pigment 9-demethyl rhodopsin (9dm-Rho). In the photoproducts of 9dm-Rho, all-trans-9-demethyl retinal acts only as a partial agonist, enabling us to study the photoproduct equilibrium of the pigment both in membranes and in detergent micelles. Chloride, bromide, and phosphate salts shift this equilibrium from the inactive MI to the active MII receptor conformation both in native membranes and even more with purified pigment in detergent micelles. In the presence of these salts, the induced MII state seems to be structurally intact, as judged by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and UV-vis spectroscopy. In the long term, however, we observe an increased instability of the photoproducts and a change in the decay pathways. Both MII enhancement and destabilization are particularly pronounced with the strong chaotropic salts KI and KSCN. The results fit into the framework of the Hofmeister effect and are assigned to an increased solvation of the peptide moiety of the solvent-exposed domains, their resulting partial disordering favoring MII over MI. In this picture, increased solvation also affects helix-helix interactions, thereby leading to a structural instability of the protein in the long term. The reported influences of salts on conformation and stability of this membrane protein are likely to be general and may therefore also apply to other transmembrane proteins and particularly to other G protein-coupled receptors.","['Animals', 'Cattle', 'Cell Membrane', 'Detergents', 'GTP-Binding Proteins', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Micelles', 'Osmolar Concentration', 'Photochemistry', 'Protein Conformation', 'Retinaldehyde', 'Rhodopsin', 'Rod Cell Outer Segment', 'Salts', 'Schiff Bases', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sodium Chloride', 'Solvents', 'Spectrophotometry, Ultraviolet', 'Surface Properties']",11148043,"[['B01.050'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.500.380.271'], ['A11.284.149'], ['D27.720.877.265', 'J01.516.381'], ['D08.811.277.040.330.300', 'D12.776.157.325'], ['G02.300'], ['D05.374', 'D26.255.560'], ['G02.640'], ['H01.181.529.711'], ['G02.111.570.820.709'], ['D02.047.850', 'D02.455.326.271.665.202.495.690', 'D02.455.426.392.368.367.379.249.700.690', 'D02.455.849.131.495.690', 'D02.455.849.291.605', 'D23.767.261.700.690'], ['D12.776.543.750.695.955', 'D23.767.930.750.500.500'], ['A08.675.650.850.625.670.375.500', 'A08.675.650.850.625.670.650.650', 'A08.675.650.915.937.670.375.500', 'A08.675.650.915.937.670.650.650', 'A08.800.950.937.670.375.500', 'A08.800.950.937.670.650.650', 'A09.371.729.831.625.670.375.500', 'A09.371.729.831.625.670.650.650', 'A11.671.650.850.625.670.375.500', 'A11.671.650.850.625.670.650.650', 'A11.671.650.915.937.670.375.500', 'A11.671.650.915.937.670.650.650'], ['D01.786'], ['D02.491.784'], ['G02.111.820', 'G04.835'], ['D01.210.450.150.875', 'D01.857.650'], ['D27.720.844'], ['E05.196.712.726.802', 'E05.196.867.826.802'], ['G02.860']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0
Quantitative structure-activity analyses of nitrobenzene toxicity to Tetrahymena pyriformis.,"Toxicity data for the 50% growth inhibitory concentration against Tetrahymena pyriformis (log (IGC50-1)) for 42 alkyl- and halogen-substituted nitro- and dinitrobenzenes were obtained experimentally. Log (IGC50-1) along with the hydrophobicity, the logarithm of the 1-octanol/water partition coefficient (log Kow), and the molecular orbital properties, the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital energy (Elumo) and maximum acceptor superdelocalizability (Amax), were used to develop quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSARs). All the nitroaromatic compounds tested had toxicity in excess of baseline, nonpolar narcosis. The nitrobenzenes were thought to elicit their toxic response through multiple (and mixed) mechanisms. No high-quality relationship was observed between toxicity and hydrophobicity, or Elumo, individually. However, a strong relationship ?log (IGC50-1) = 16.4(Amax) - 4.64; n = 42, r2 = 0.847, s = 0.279, F = 229? was obtained. In an effort to improve predictability, two-parameter QSAR, or response surface, analyses were performed. These analyses resulted in the following QSARs: ?log (IGC50-1) = 0.206(log Kow) - 16.0(Amax) - 5.04; n = 42, r2 = 0.897, s = 0.229, F = 180? and ?log (IGC50-1) = 0.467(log Kow) - 1.60(Elumo) - 2.55; n = 42, r2 = 0.881, s = 0.246, F = 154?.","['Animals', 'Environmental Pollutants', 'Models, Chemical', 'Nitrobenzenes', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Tetrahymena pyriformis']",9705752,"[['B01.050'], ['D27.888.284'], ['E05.599.495'], ['D02.455.426.559.389.565', 'D02.640.529'], ['G02.111.830', 'G07.690.773.997'], ['B01.043.185.650.375.750.850.700']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Strand-selective transcription of globin genes in rabbit erythroid cells and chromatin.,"In order to investigate the symmetry of globin gene transcription, complementary RNA (cRNA) was synthesized using rabbit globin complementary DNA (cDNA) as a template for Escherichia coli DNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RNA nucleotidyltransferase). The cRNA hybridized specifically to its own cDNA template but not to sheep cDNA, rabbit globin mRNA, or poly(dT). Hybridization studies with cRNA demonstrated that RNA sequences transcribed from the DNA strand complementary to the globin gene region (anti-strand) were not present in cellular, total nuclear, or fractionated nuclear RNA from rabbit marrow. Such sequences were detected in RNA transcribed from rabbit marrow chromatin by E. coli or sheep liver RNA polymerases, but amounted to less than 50% of the globin mRNA sequences present in the same transcript. The evidence indicates that globin mRNA transcription is predominantly DNA strand specific.","['Animals', 'Bone Marrow', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Chromatin', 'DNA-Directed RNA Polymerases', 'Escherichia coli', 'Genes', 'Globins', 'Kinetics', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'Rabbits', 'Templates, Genetic', 'Transcription, Genetic']",1108006,"[['B01.050'], ['A15.382.216'], ['A11.148', 'A15.378.316'], ['A11.284.430.106.279.345.190.160.180', 'D12.776.664.224', 'G05.360.160.180'], ['D08.811.913.696.445.735.270'], ['B03.440.450.425.325.300', 'B03.660.250.150.180.100'], ['G05.360.340.024.340'], ['D12.776.422.316'], ['G01.374.661', 'G02.111.490'], ['E05.393.661', 'G02.111.611'], ['G02.111.660.871', 'G03.734.871', 'G05.297.670'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.968.700'], ['G05.360.840'], ['G02.111.873', 'G05.297.700']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Disruption of adeB gene has a greater effect on resistance to meropenems than adeA gene in Acinetobacter spp. isolated from University Malaya Medical Centre.,"INTRODUCTION: The AdeABC pump of Acinetobacter spp. confers resistance to various antibiotic classes. This pump is composed of the AdeA, AdeB, and AdeC proteins where AdeB is a member of the resistance-nodulation-division efflux pump superfamily. The adeA, adeB, and adeC genes are contiguous and adjacent to adeS and adeR, which are transcribed in the opposite direction and which specify proteins homologous to sensors and regulators of two-component systems, respectively. In this study, an attempt is made to elucidate the role of the AdeABC efflux pump in carbapenem resistance in Acinetobacter spp.METHODS: 39 carbapenem-resistant clinical isolates of Acinetobacter spp. were used. Minimum inhibitory concentrations were evaluated using the agar dilution method according to Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute standards. The presence of carbapenem hydrolysing oxacillinases and AdeABC efflux pump genes were determined by PCR amplification. Subsequently, each gene was inactivated by plasmid insertion in order to study the contribution of these genes in developing antibiotic resistance and the resulting mutants were tested for their antimicrobial susceptibilities.RESULTS: Among the multidrug-resistant strains, 36 strains had all the three (A, B, C) genes detected, while the remaining three strains had one or two of the genes detected. Inactivation of these individual genes showed decreased antimicrobial susceptibility indicating its contribution towards the development of antimicrobial resistance.CONCLUSION: The presence of AdeABC multidrug efflux pump plays a major role in the development of antimicrobial resistance in Acinetobacter spp. The presence of either one or an interplay between these genes may have an effect on antimicrobial resistance in Acinetobacter spp.","['Acinetobacter', 'Acinetobacter Infections', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Bacterial Proteins', 'Carbapenems', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple, Bacterial', 'Humans', 'Malaysia', 'Membrane Transport Proteins', 'Meropenem', 'Models, Genetic', 'Mutation', 'Plasmids', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Thienamycins']",19710984,"[['B03.440.400.425.537.050', 'B03.660.250.530.050'], ['C01.150.252.400.560.022'], ['D27.505.954.122.085'], ['D12.776.097'], ['D02.065.589.099.124', 'D03.633.100.300.124'], ['G06.099.225.812', 'G06.225.347.812', 'G07.690.773.984.269.347.812', 'G07.690.773.984.300.500'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['Z01.252.145.487'], ['D12.776.157.530', 'D12.776.543.585'], ['D02.065.589.099.124.300.750', 'D03.633.100.300.124.300.750'], ['E05.599.395.397'], ['G05.365.590'], ['G05.360.600'], ['E05.393.620.500'], ['E05.393.760.700'], ['D02.065.589.099.124.300', 'D03.633.100.300.124.300']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
Design considerations for an eHealth decision support tool in inflammatory bowel disease self-management.,"BACKGROUND: Electronic health (eHealth) decision support tools have the potential to: facilitate inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) self-management, reduce health care utilisation and alleviate the pressure on overburdened outpatient clinics. The purpose of this study was to explore the perspectives of key stakeholders on the potential use of a decision support tool for IBD patients.METHODS: A qualitative study using focus group methodology was conducted at a tertiary IBD centre in Melbourne, Australia in February 2015. Key stakeholders, including physicians, nurses and patients, were included in the study. Two independent reviewers undertook inductive coding and generated themes.RESULTS: In total, 31 participants were included in the study (including 16 males; 11 physicians; 6 nurses). An eHealth decision support tool was thought to be beneficial to facilitate IBD self-management. Four themes emerged: (i) Framework for the decision support tool - the tool should be an adjunct to current models of care and facilitate shared decision-making and patient engagement; (ii) Target population - stable patients with mild to moderate disease; (iii) Functionalities of the intervention - a web-based platform encompassing patient-reported outcomes, objective markers of disease and clinical algorithms based on international guidelines; and (iv) Design and Implementation - patients should be involved in the design.CONCLUSIONS: eHealth interventions are thought to be an important strategy to facilitate self-management for patients with IBD. A multi-stage iterative approach should be adopted in the design and implementation process of eHealth interventions. Patient perspectives need to be sought prior to and throughout the development of an eHealth decision support tools for IBD.","['Australia', 'Decision Support Techniques', 'Female', 'Focus Groups', 'Humans', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Male', 'Patient Participation', 'Qualitative Research', 'Self-Management', 'Telemedicine']",29136332,"[['Z01.639.100', 'Z01.678.100.373'], ['E05.245', 'L01.313.500.750.190'], ['E05.318.308.112', 'N05.715.360.300.269', 'N06.850.520.308.112'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C06.405.205.731', 'C06.405.469.432'], ['F01.100.150.750.500.620', 'F01.145.488.887.500.620', 'N02.421.143.212.300', 'N03.540.245.360.300', 'N05.300.150.800.500.620'], ['H01.770.644.241.850'], ['N02.421.784.760'], ['H02.403.840', 'L01.178.847.652', 'N04.590.374.800']]","['Geographicals [Z]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]']",0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1
"Simple model to explain effects of plasma protein binding and tissue binding on calculated volumes of distribution, apparent elimination rate constants and clearances.","A simple pharmacokinetic model, incorporating linear plasma protein binding, linear tissue binding, and first order elimination of free (unbound) drug, was studied. If Clp is the plasma clearance, Vf is the ""true"" volume of distribution of free drug, beta is the apparent elimination rate constant, sigma is the fraction of the drug which is free in plasma, f is the fraction of the drug which is free in the entire body, kf is the intrinsic elimination rate constant for free drug, and AoTB is the initial amount of drug which is bound to tissues, then the model indicates that the following relationships hold: (1) Clp = Vfsigma kf; (2) beta = f kf; and Vdext = (sigma/f) Vf. Only sigma, and not f, can be measured experimentally. Dividing Clp by sigma provides an estimate of the intrinsic clearance of free drug, Vfkf. A plot of Vdext versus sigma has an intercept equal to Vf, and the ratio of the slope/intercept is an estimate of AoTB/Aof, where Aof is the initial amount of free drug (equal to Vf times initial concentration of free drug in plasma). Thus, an estimate of AoTB may be obtained. Dividing the intrinsic clearance by Vf provides an estimate of kf. Thus, theoretically, estimates of Vf, kf, AoTB and f may be obtained. The variables are not separated when beta is plotted versus sigma, and curvature of such plots is expected; no useful information is obtained from such plots.","['Blood Proteins', 'Kinetics', 'Mathematics', 'Metabolic Clearance Rate', 'Models, Biological', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Protein Binding', 'Proteins']",1001358,"[['D12.776.124'], ['G01.374.661', 'G02.111.490'], ['H01.548'], ['E01.370.225.843', 'E05.200.843', 'G03.490', 'G07.690.595', 'G07.690.725.513'], ['E05.599.395'], ['D26'], ['G02.111.679', 'G03.808'], ['D12.776']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
Digital analysis of mouthrinses' staining characteristics on provisional acrylic resins.,"Provisional restorations are expected to be both aestethically and physically durable during the preparation of permanent restorations. In this study, the staining properties of mouthrinses containing chlorhexidine gluconate, benzydamine hydrochloride and a hybrid mouthrinse were investigated on light and dark shades of a provisional acrylic resin. Totally 80 specimens were prepared and were photographed digitally to obtain the baseline L*, a*, b* values. Each sample was immersed in test solutions for 12 h which was equivalent time to 1 year of mouthrinse use, and the post-treatment images of the test materials were acquired. All L*, a*, b* values were analysed by a graphic software, and the total colour change (DeltaE*) of each specimen was calculated. Also the same colour analyses were performed on all test solutions to establish their colour parameters. Analysis of variance and Tukey's tests were used for statistical analyses and alpha was 0.05. All test solutions produced perceptible staining on the provisional material, with DeltaE values over 3.7. In both shades, hybrid rinse caused the highest staining (DeltaE=5.705), and was followed by chlorhexidine gluconate rinse, with DeltaE value of 4.120.

Inhibition of matrix metalloproteinases reduces local and distant organ injury following experimental acute pancreatitis.,"BACKGROUND: Pulmonary complications from pancreatitis involve parenchymal destruction via proteolytic enzymes. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) may play an important role in pulmonary injury following acute severe pancreatitis. We hypothesized that local and distant organ injury would be decreased by the presence of an MMP inhibitor (Batimistat; BB-94) following severe acute pancreatitis (AP).METHODS: Eighteen male rats were randomized into two groups: BB-94 (AP + 40 mg/kg/24 h BB-94 ip x three doses) or control (AP + 20 ml/kg/24 h normal saline ip x three doses). Necrotizing AP was induced by retrograde infusion of 5% sodium taurocholate (1.5 ml/kg) into the pancreatic duct. Twenty additional animals were randomized into BB-94 and control groups for the survival study. Serum was evaluated for amylase and MMP activity. Pancreatic sections were graded for edema, necrosis, neutrophil infiltrate, and hemorrhage. Myloperoxidase (MPO) activity was used to determine PMN infiltration in the lung. Evan's Blue dye extravasation was used to quantify vascular permeability.RESULTS: Animals in the BB-94 group had decreased amylase levels (1086.0 +/- 61.7 U/L vs 2232.7 +/- 309.9 U/L; P < 0.05), decreased cellular infiltrate (1.4 +/- 0.2 vs 2.3 +/- 0.2; P < 0.02), and decreased necrosis (4.1 +/- 0.3 vs 6.1 +/- 0.4; P < 0.005) compared to the control group. Lung tissue following pancreatitis in the BB-94 group demonstrated decreased MPO activity (41.5 +/- 2.4 units vs 57.3 +/- 2.9 units; P < 0.05) and decreased vascular permeability (18.3 +/- 2.8 mg/100 g vs 30.1 +/- 4.6 mg/100 g; P < 0.05). Animals treated with BB-94 had 100% survival compared to 50% survival in control at 72 h.CONCLUSIONS: Pancreatitis results in increased local and distant MMP activity. Pulmonary and pancreatic injury following AP can be abrogated by treatment with an MMP inhibitor (Batimistat; BB-94) which may result in decreased morbidity and mortality.","['Amylases', 'Animals', 'Lung', 'Lung Diseases', 'Male', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase Inhibitors', 'Matrix Metalloproteinases', 'Metalloendopeptidases', 'Models, Animal', 'Pancreas', 'Pancreatic Diseases', 'Pancreatitis, Acute Necrotizing', 'Peroxidase', 'Phenylalanine', 'Protease Inhibitors', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome', 'Thiophenes']",12643851,"[['D08.811.277.450.066'], ['B01.050'], ['A04.411'], ['C08.381'], ['D27.505.519.389.745.610'], ['D08.811.277.656.300.480.525', 'D08.811.277.656.675.374.525'], ['D08.811.277.656.300.480', 'D08.811.277.656.675.374'], ['E05.598'], ['A03.734'], ['C06.689'], ['C06.689.750.650'], ['D08.811.682.732.700'], ['D12.125.072.050.685', 'D12.125.142.666'], ['D27.505.519.389.745'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700.750'], ['C23.550.470.790', 'C23.550.835.900'], ['D02.886.778', 'D03.383.903']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Physiological response to ""pressure-demand"" respirator wear.","This investigation determined cardiorespiratory responses of subjects with normal lung function and exercise tolerance and compared them with subjects with moderate impairment of lung function and exercise tolerance. The respirator was an air-line full-face mask (MSA-Ultravue) ""pressure-demand"" breathing type equipped with an inspiratory resistance of 85 mmH2O at 85 L/min air flow. This resistance was operable in conjunction with the fixed 25 mmH2O inspiratory and expiratory resistance required to pressurize the face piece. Physiologically and subjectively the response of the normal and moderately impaired subjects to respirator wear during rest, 35%, 50% and 80% of their maximal aerobic capacity (VO2max) were not different. However, the pressure swings inside the face piece exceeded 24 cmH2O and resulted in 50% of the subjects being unable to finish 10 minutes of work at 80% VO2max. The greater the ventilatory demand placed upon the respirator due to increasing workload, the more like a ""demand"" system pressure-flow response the ""pressure-demand"" system produced. Hence, the concept of increased protection and reduced inspiratory resistance as a result of pressurizing the facepiece during heavy work is seriously questioned.","['Adult', 'Female', 'Heart Rate', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Oxygen Consumption', 'Physical Exertion', 'Pressure', 'Protective Devices', 'Respiratory Function Tests', 'Respiratory Protective Devices', 'Stress, Physiological']",7148683,"[['M01.060.116'], ['E01.370.600.875.500', 'G09.330.380.500'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['G03.680'], ['G11.427.683'], ['G01.374.715'], ['E07.700', 'J01.637.708'], ['E01.370.386.700'], ['E07.700.700', 'J01.637.708.560.937'], ['G07.775']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]']",0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0
Hypoalgesia in response to transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) depends on stimulation intensity.,"UNLABELLED: Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) is an electrophysical modality used for pain management. This study investigated the dose response of different TENS intensities on experimentally induced pressure pain. One hundred and thirty TENS na?ve healthy individuals (18-64 years old; 65 males, 65 females) were randomly allocated to 5 groups (n = 26 per group): Strong Non Painful TENS; Sensory Threshold TENS; Below Sensory Threshold TENS; No Current Placebo TENS; and Transient Placebo TENS. Active TENS (80 Hz) was applied to the forearm for 30 minutes. Transient Placebo TENS was applied for 42 seconds after which the current amplitude automatically reset to 0 mA. Pressure pain thresholds (PPT) were recorded from 2 points on the hand and forearm before and after TENS to measure hypoalgesia. There were significant differences between groups at both the hand and forearm (ANOVA; P = .005 and .002). At 30 minutes, there was a significant hypoalgesic effect in the Strong Non Painful TENS group compared to: Below Sensory Threshold TENS, No Current Placebo TENS and Transient Placebo TENS groups (P < .0001) at the forearm; Transient Placebo TENS and No Current Placebo TENS groups at the hand (P = .001). There was no significant difference between Strong Non Painful TENS and Sensory Threshold TENS groups. The area under the curve for the changes in PPT significantly correlated with the current amplitude (r(2) = .33, P = .003). These data therefore show that there is a dose-response effect of TENS with the largest effect occurring with the highest current amplitudes.PERSPECTIVE: This study shows a dose response for the intensity of TENS for pain relief with the strongest intensities showing the greatest effect; thus, we suggest that TENS intensity should be titrated to achieve the strongest possible intensity to achieve maximum pain relief.","['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Biophysical Phenomena', 'Biophysics', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Female', 'Hand', 'Humans', 'Hyperalgesia', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pain', 'Pain Management', 'Pain Measurement', 'Pain Threshold', 'Transcutaneous Electric Nerve Stimulation', 'Young Adult']",21481649,"[['M01.060.057'], ['M01.060.116'], ['E05.318.740.150', 'N05.715.360.750.125', 'N06.850.520.830.150'], ['G01.154'], ['H01.158.344', 'H01.671.100'], ['E05.318.370.300', 'E05.581.500.300', 'N05.715.360.325.320', 'N06.850.520.445.300'], ['A01.378.800.667'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C10.597.751.791.400', 'C23.888.592.763.770.400'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['C23.888.592.612', 'F02.830.816.444', 'G11.561.790.444'], ['E02.745', 'N04.590.607.500'], ['E01.370.600.550.324'], ['F02.463.593.710.560', 'F02.830.816.444.700', 'G11.561.790.444.700'], ['E02.331.800', 'E02.779.468.800', 'E02.831.535.468.800', 'E03.091.823'], ['M01.060.116.815']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]']",1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0
Comparison of different structural foot types for measures of standing postural control.,"STUDY DESIGN: Matched group comparison of 3 subject groups with 3 different foot structures for force plate and clinical measures of postural control.OBJECTIVES: To determine if subjects with different weight-bearing foot structure would demonstrate differences in static standing postural control, and to determine the reliability of study procedures.BACKGROUND: Weight-bearing foot structure may influence postural control either because of a decreased base of support (supinated foot structure) or because of passive instability of the joints of the foot (pronated foot structure).METHODS AND MEASURES: Young adults were categorized based on weight-bearing foot structure into neutral, pronated, or supinated groups (15 subjects per group). Postural control in single-limb stance with eyes closed was assessed using force plate measures and by measuring duration of single-limb stance on a firm floor and on a balance pad. Force plate measures were normalized center-of-pressure average speed; and standard deviation and maximum displacement in the anterior-posterior and medial-lateral directions.RESULTS: Individuals in the supinated group had significantly greater center-of-pressure average speed, greater maximum displacement in the anterior-posterior direction, and greater SD and maximum displacement in the medial-lateral direction than individuals in the neutral group. The individuals in the pronated group had significantly greater SD and maximum displacement in the anterior-posterior direction, used more trials to complete force plate testing, and had shorter single-limb stance duration than those in the neutral group.CONCLUSION: Individuals with pronated feet or supinated feet have poorer postural control than individuals with neutral feet, but perhaps through different mechanisms.","['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Female', 'Foot', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Pronation', 'Proprioception', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Supination', 'Weight-Bearing']",17193872,"[['M01.060.057'], ['M01.060.116'], ['A01.378.610.250'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['G11.427.410.698.840'], ['F02.830.816.541', 'G07.888.750', 'G11.561.790.541'], ['E05.318.370.725', 'E05.337.851', 'N05.715.360.325.685', 'N06.850.520.445.725'], ['G11.427.410.698.920'], ['G01.374.965']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]']",1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0

Enhancement of image quality with a fast iterative scatter and beam hardening correction method for kV CBCT.,"The problem of the enormous amount of scattered radiation in kV CBCT (kilo voltage cone beam computer tomography) is addressed. Scatter causes undesirable streak- and cup-artifacts and results in a quantitative inaccuracy of reconstructed CT numbers, so that an accurate dose calculation might be impossible. Image contrast is also significantly reduced. Therefore we checked whether an appropriate implementation of the fast iterative scatter correction algorithm we have developed for MV (mega voltage) CBCT reduces the scatter contribution in a kV CBCT as well. This scatter correction method is based on a superposition of pre-calculated Monte Carlo generated pencil beam scatter kernels. The algorithm requires only a system calibration by measuring homogeneous slab phantoms with known water-equivalent thicknesses. In this study we compare scatter corrected CBCT images of several phantoms to the fan beam CT images acquired with a reduced cone angle (a slice-thickness of 14 mm in the isocenter) at the same system. Additional measurements at a different CBCT system were made (different energy spectrum and phantom-to-detector distance) and a first order approach of a fast beam hardening correction will be introduced. The observed image quality of the scatter corrected CBCT images is comparable concerning resolution, noise and contrast-to-noise ratio to the images acquired in fan beam geometry. Compared to the CBCT without any corrections the contrast of the contrast-and-resolution phantom with scatter correction and additional beam hardening correction is improved by a factor of about 1.5. The reconstructed attenuation coefficients and the CT numbers of the scatter corrected CBCT images are close to the values of the images acquired in fan beam geometry for the most pronounced tissue types. Only for extreme dense tissue types like cortical bone we see a difference in CT numbers of 5.2%, which can be improved to 4.4% with the additional beam hardening correction. Cupping is reduced from 20% to 4% with scatter correction and 3% with an additional beam hardening correction. After 3 iterations (small phantoms) and 6 to 7 iterations (large phantoms) the algorithm converges. Therefore the algorithm is very fast, that means 1.3 seconds per projection for 3 iterations on a standard PC.","['Algorithms', 'Calibration', 'Equipment Design', 'Head', 'Humans', 'Imaging, Three-Dimensional', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Pelvis', 'Phantoms, Imaging', 'Photography', 'Radiation Dosage', 'Radiographic Image Enhancement', 'Radiography, Thoracic', 'Radiotherapy', 'Scattering, Radiation']",19761093,"[['G17.035', 'L01.224.050'], ['E05.978.155'], ['E05.320'], ['A01.456'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E01.370.350.400', 'L01.224.308.410'], ['E05.318.740.525', 'L01.906.394.422', 'N05.715.360.750.540', 'N06.850.520.830.525'], ['A01.923.600'], ['E07.671'], ['E01.370.350.600', 'E05.712'], ['E05.799.513', 'G01.750.740', 'N06.850.810.250'], ['E01.370.350.600.350.700', 'E01.370.350.700.700', 'L01.224.308.380.600'], ['E01.370.350.700.730'], ['E02.815'], ['E05.196.822', 'G01.867']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Health Care [N]']",1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0
Training radial basis function networks for wind speed prediction using PSO enhanced differential search optimizer.,"This paper presents an integrated hybrid optimization algorithm for training the radial basis function neural network (RBF NN). Training of neural networks is still a challenging exercise in machine learning domain. Traditional training algorithms in general suffer and trap in local optima and lead to premature convergence, which makes them ineffective when applied for datasets with diverse features. Training algorithms based on evolutionary computations are becoming popular due to their robust nature in overcoming the drawbacks of the traditional algorithms. Accordingly, this paper proposes a hybrid training procedure with differential search (DS) algorithm functionally integrated with the particle swarm optimization (PSO). To surmount the local trapping of the search procedure, a new population initialization scheme is proposed using Logistic chaotic sequence, which enhances the population diversity and aid the search capability. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed RBF hybrid training algorithm, experimental analysis on publicly available 7 benchmark datasets are performed. Subsequently, experiments were conducted on a practical application case for wind speed prediction to expound the superiority of the proposed RBF training algorithm in terms of prediction accuracy.","['Machine Learning', 'Models, Theoretical', 'Neural Networks, Computer', 'Wind']",29768463,"[['G17.035.250.500', 'L01.224.050.375.530'], ['E05.599'], ['G17.485', 'L01.224.050.375.605'], ['G16.500.175.249.200', 'G16.500.275.063.725.154.200', 'G16.500.750.775.780', 'N06.230.132.644.875', 'N06.230.300.100.150.185.200', 'N06.230.300.100.725.780']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]']",0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0
Genomic organization of low copy number sequences that are associated with deca-satellite DNA in the monkey genome.,"A previously described segment of African green monkey DNA (cloned in phage lambda MkA) contains deca-satellite linked to DNA sequences that are estimated to occur once per genome. Sequences homologous to the low copy number sequences in lambda MkA are also associated with species-specific satellite DNAs in the human and mouse genomes. A second clone, lambda Mk8, contains a monkey DNA region that is colinear and homologous to a portion of the low copy number sequences in lambda MkA, but no satellite sequences. The two cloned segments are markedly different starting at a point proximal to the satellite DNA region in lambda MkA. DNA-blotting experiments indicate that lambda Mk8 but not lambda MkA represents the typical genomic organization and that the low copy number segments occur only once per haploid genome. The data suggest that rearrangements such as deletions or inversions occurring in monkey cells account in part for the structure of lambda MkA. Additional rearrangements may have occurred during cloning in E. coli. This unique chromosomal region may be particularly susceptible to recombination.","['Animals', 'Cercopithecus', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'DNA Restriction Enzymes', 'DNA, Recombinant', 'DNA, Satellite', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', 'Species Specificity']",2825119,"[['B01.050'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.199.120.126'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.199.120.126.110'], ['D08.811.150.280', 'D08.811.277.352.335.350.300', 'D08.811.277.352.355.325.300'], ['D13.444.308.460'], ['D13.444.308.480', 'G02.111.570.080.708.800.150', 'G05.360.080.708.800.150', 'G05.360.340.024.220.150', 'G05.360.340.024.850.150'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500'], ['G02.111.810.550', 'G05.810.550'], ['G16.824']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Magnetic resonance imaging-based spirometry for regional assessment of pulmonary function.,"In this work MRI-based spirometry is presented as a method for noninvasively assessing pulmonary mechanical function on a regional basis. A SPAMM tagging sequence was modified to allow continuous dynamic imaging of the lungs during respiration. A motion-tracking algorithm was developed to track material regions from time-resolved grid-tagged images. Experiments were performed to image the lungs during quiet breathing and volumetric strain was calculated from the measured displacement maps. Regional volume calculations, derived from volumetric strain, were integrated over the entire lung and compared to segmented volume calculations with good agreement.

Uncapped nanobranch-based CuS clews used as an efficient peroxidase mimic enable the visual detection of hydrogen peroxide and glucose with fast response.,"Nanosized materials acting as substitutes of natural enzymes are currently attracting significant research due to their stable enzyme-like characteristics, but some flaws of these nanozymes, including their limited catalytic rate and efficiency, need to be remedied to enable their wider applications. In this work, we verify for the first time the catalytic behavior of uncapped nanobranch-based CuS clews as a peroxidase mimic. XRD, XPS, SEM, and TEM proofs demonstrate that high-purity CuS clews composed of intertwined wires with abundant nanodendrites outside are successfully produced via a facile one-pot hydrothermal synthesis approach, with thiourea as both the sulfion source and the structure-directing agent. The synthesized CuS can catalytically oxidize 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) by H2O2 to trigger a visible color reaction with rapid response (reaching a maximum change within 5 min). The proposed CuS nanozyme exhibits preferable catalytic kinetics over natural horseradish peroxidase (HRP). This outstanding activity primarily results from the large surface area and rich sites exposed by the uncapped unique structure. Under optimized conditions, the fabricated sensing system provides linear absorbance (652 nm) changes in the H2O2 concentration range of 0.2?130 ìM, with a detection limit of as low as 63 nM. When coupled with glucose oxidase (GOD), the system is demonstrated to be capable of monitoring glucose in blood samples with excellent performance.","['Biomimetic Materials', 'Biosensing Techniques', 'Copper', 'Glucose', 'Glucose Oxidase', 'Hydrogen Peroxide', 'Nanostructures', 'Peroxidase', 'Time Factors']",27846988,"[['J01.637.087'], ['E05.601.043'], ['D01.268.556.195', 'D01.268.956.170', 'D01.552.544.195'], ['D09.947.875.359.448'], ['D08.811.682.047.239'], ['D01.248.497.158.685.750.424', 'D01.339.431.374.424', 'D01.650.550.750.400', 'D02.389.338.253'], ['J01.637.512'], ['D08.811.682.732.700'], ['G01.910.857']]","['Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
Immunotherapy with imiquimod 5% cream for eyelid nodular basal cell carcinoma.,"PURPOSE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of topical imiquimod 5% cream for the treatment of eyelid basal cell carcinoma.DESIGN: Two interventional case reports.METHODS: Imiquimod 5% cream was applied topically once daily, 3 days a week for 8 to 12 weeks, in two patients affected by eyelid nodular basal cell carcinoma. Patients were followed up clinically with slit-lamp examination for evidence of tumor disappearance or recurrence, and local and systemic side effects.RESULTS: Complete clinical response was obtained in both patients. No severe local side effects were observed. Patients did not show any local recurrence after 1 year.CONCLUSIONS: Topical imiquimod 5% cream seems to be a useful treatment for eyelid nodular basal cell carcinoma in selected cases, but further long-term studies are needed to assess the efficacy and safety of this approach.","['Administration, Topical', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Aminoquinolines', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Carcinoma, Basal Cell', 'Eyelid Neoplasms', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Imiquimod', 'Immunotherapy', 'Interferon Inducers', 'Male', 'Ointments', 'Treatment Outcome']",16376667,"[['E02.319.267.120'], ['M01.060.116.100.080'], ['D03.633.100.810.050'], ['D27.505.954.248'], ['C04.557.470.200.165', 'C04.557.470.565.165'], ['C04.588.443.392.500', 'C11.319.421', 'C11.338.526'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D03.633.100.810.050.545'], ['E02.095.465.425'], ['D27.505.696.477.828'], ['D26.255.640'], ['E01.789.800', 'N04.761.559.590.800', 'N05.715.360.575.575.800']]","['Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Health Care [N]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0

Implementation of UV-based advanced oxidation processes in algal medium recycling.,"Algae show great potential as sustainable feedstock for numerous bioproducts. However, large volume of water consumption during algal biomass production makes that the culture media recycling is a necessity due to economic and environmental concern. To avoid the negative effect of enriched organic matters in the harvested culture media, pre-treatment prior to medium replenishment and reuse is required. In this study, degradation of algenitic organic matters (AOM) in the culture media by UV-based photolysis processes (i.e., direct UV, UV/peroxydisulfate (PDS), UV/H2O2, and UV/NH2Cl) was explored. The results showed that UV, UV/PDS, UV/H2O2 and UV/NH2Cl caused a decrease of SUVA for 29.9%, 35.4%, 40.45%, and 22.6%, respectively, though the organic matter was almost not mineralized. Fluorescence excitation-emission matrix combined with parallel factor analysis indicated that UV/PDS and UV/H2O2 degraded 47.26%-56.31% of the fulvic-like and humic-like fractions in AOM. Powder activated carbon absorption and growth evaluation for the AOPs-treated media indicated that UV/PDS and UV/H2O2 processes not only could remove the growth inhibitors in the media, but were also beneficial to the algae growth. These results suggested that UV/PDS and UV/H2O2 could effectively degrade the hydrophobic components in AOM and converted the growth inhibition fraction of AOM in the recycled media into nutrient source for algal growth. Different from the general application of UV-based AOP in the wastewater treatment, this study provided an innovative idea about how to pre-treat AOM in the media recycling: utilization rather than removal, which was a more sustainable and environment-friendly technology.","['Hydrogen Peroxide', 'Microalgae', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Recycling', 'Ultraviolet Rays', 'Waste Disposal, Fluid', 'Waste Water', 'Water Pollutants, Chemical']",29627547,"[['D01.248.497.158.685.750.424', 'D01.339.431.374.424', 'D01.650.550.750.400', 'D02.389.338.253'], ['B05.080.500.600.500'], ['G02.700', 'G03.295.531'], ['N06.850.780.200.800.800.525', 'N06.850.860.510.244'], ['G01.358.500.505.650.891', 'G01.590.540.891', 'G01.750.250.650.891', 'G01.750.750.659', 'G01.750.770.578.891', 'G16.500.275.063.725.525.600', 'G16.500.750.775.525.600', 'N06.230.300.100.725.525.600'], ['N06.850.780.200.800.800.890', 'N06.850.860.510.900.600.900'], ['D20.944.932', 'N06.850.460.710.865'], ['D27.888.284.903.655']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Health Care [N]']",0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
Virus neutralising activity of African fruit bat (Eidolon helvum) sera against emerging lyssaviruses.,"It is likely that phylogroup 2 lyssaviruses circulate within bat reservoirs. We adapted a pseudotype (pt) neutralisation assay (PNA) to a multiplex format enabling serosurveillance for Lagos bat virus (LBV), Mokola virus (MOKV) and West Caucasian bat virus (WCBV) in a potential reservoir, the African straw-coloured fruit bat, Eidolon helvum. Highly correlated titres were observed between single and multiplex PNAs using ptLBV and ptMOKV (r=0.97, p<0.0001), validating its use for bat serosurveillance. Of the bat serum samples screened 56% neutralised ptLBV, 27% ptMOKV and 1% ptWCBV. Mean VNAb titres were 1:266, 1:35 and 1:7 against ptLBV, ptMOKV and ptWCBV respectively. The high seroprevalence estimates suggest that the infection rate of LBV in E. helvum remains high enough to persist in this species. This supports the hypothesis that LBV is endemic in Ghanaian E. helvum and we speculate that LBV may have co-evolved with African megachiroptera.","['Animals', 'Antibodies, Viral', 'Biological Evolution', 'Chiroptera', 'Communicable Diseases, Emerging', 'Disease Reservoirs', 'Female', 'Ghana', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Lyssavirus', 'Male', 'Neutralization Tests', 'Rabies virus', 'Rhabdoviridae Infections', 'Species Specificity']",20951400,"[['B01.050'], ['D12.776.124.486.485.114.254', 'D12.776.124.790.651.114.254', 'D12.776.377.715.548.114.254'], ['G05.045', 'G16.075'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.937'], ['C01.221.500', 'C23.550.291.531.750'], ['N06.850.520.203.250'], ['Z01.058.290.190.320'], ['A11.251.210.172.750', 'A11.436.334'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['B04.820.480.937.750.500'], ['E01.370.225.812.735.550', 'E05.200.812.735.550', 'E05.478.594.760.550'], ['B04.820.480.937.750.500.700'], ['C01.925.782.580.830'], ['G16.824']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1

Atlas registration for edema-corrected MRI lesion volume in mouse stroke models.,"Lesion volume measurements with magnetic resonance imaging are widely used to assess outcome in rodent models of stroke. In this study, we improved a mathematical framework to correct lesion size for edema which is based on manual delineation of the lesion and hemispheres. Furthermore, a novel MATLAB toolbox to register mouse brain MR images to the Allen brain atlas is presented. Its capability to calculate edema-corrected lesion size was compared to the manual approach. Automated image registration performed equally well in in a mouse middle cerebral artery occlusion model (Pearson r = 0.976, p = 2.265e-11). Information encapsulated in the registration was used to generate maps of edema induced tissue volume changes. These showed discrepancies to simplified tissue models underlying the manual approach.

Induction of tolerance in quadruple chimeric mice.,"Human cord blood (CB) contains hematopoietic stem cells and progenitors. Because the major limitation to a widespread use of CB for transplantation lies in its limited volume, it is necessary to combine the CB from several donors. In this study, we show that lethally irradiated mice can be reconstituted with the injection of a mixture of T cell-depleted bone marrow cells (BMCs; total, 3 x 10(6)) obtained from three fully allogeneic mouse strains in two different mouse combinations. A higher survival rate was obtained in the triple injection group than in mice injected with BMCs (1 x10(6)) obtained from a single mouse strain. In the mixed chimeric mice, three kinds of donor-type and recipient-type cells were detected in all the hematopoietic organs 1 month after bone marrow transplantation (BMT). Mixed-lymphocyte reaction showed that the tolerance to both recipient-type and donor-type major histocompatibility complex determinants was induced in the chimeric mice. In the peripheral blood (PB) of these mice, only one type of cells from the three different donor strains became dominant in most chimeric mice and reached a stable level about 4 months after BMT. Polymerase chain reaction analyses, however, revealed that the skins from all the donors were accepted even when no cells with their phenotypes could be detected in the PB. These results suggest that both hemato-lymphoid reconstitution and stable tolerance to not only the recipient strain but also all the donor strains can be achieved in chimeric mice, indicating the possibility of mixed CB transplantation in humans.","['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cord Blood Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Female', 'Graft Survival', 'Histocompatibility Antigens', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Phenotype', 'Skin', 'Skin Transplantation', 'Species Specificity', 'T-Lymphocytes', 'Transplantation Chimera', 'Transplantation Tolerance']",15342933,"[['B01.050'], ['E02.095.147.725.040', 'E04.936.580.040'], ['G04.172', 'G07.345.500.325.180.500', 'G08.686.155', 'G08.686.784.170.104.249'], ['G04.161.750', 'G07.345.249.410.750'], ['E02.095.147.500.500.312', 'E04.936.225.687.312'], ['G12.875.545.340'], ['D23.050.301.500', 'D23.050.705.552'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500'], ['B01.050.050.199.520.520.338', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500.400.338'], ['B01.050.050.199.520.520.388', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500.400.388'], ['B01.050.050.199.520.520.420', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500.400.420'], ['B01.050.050.199.520.520.500', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500.400.500'], ['G05.695'], ['A17.815'], ['E02.095.147.725.700', 'E04.680.275.850', 'E04.936.580.700'], ['G16.824'], ['A11.118.637.555.567.569', 'A15.145.229.637.555.567.569', 'A15.382.490.555.567.569'], ['B05.200.750'], ['G12.535.425.955']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
The impact of the Thai motorcycle transition on road traffic injury: Thai Cohort Study results.,"OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of motorcycle to car transitioning and urbanisation on traffic injury rates in Thailand.DESIGN: Analysis of two consecutive surveys of a large national cohort study.SETTING: Thailand.PARTICIPANTS: The data derived from 57,154 Thai Cohort Study (TCS) participants who provided relevant data on both the 2005 and 2009 surveys.PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Motorcycle and car traffic crash injury self-reported in 2009, with twelve months' recall.RESULTS: In 2009, 5608(10%) participants reported a traffic crash injury. Most crashes involved a motorcycle (74%). Car access increased and motorcycle use decreased between 2005 and 2009. Among those who used a motorcycle at both time points, traffic injury incidence was 2.8 times greater compared to those who did not use a motorcycle at either time point. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to test longitudinal and cross sectional factors associated with traffic crash injury: in the adjusted model, cars were negatively and motorcycles positively associated with injury. Living in an urban area was not injury protective in the adjusted model of traffic crash injury.CONCLUSIONS: Ongoing urbanisation in Thailand can be expected to lead to further reductions in road traffic injuries based on transition from motorcycles to cars in urban areas. Cities, however, do not provide an intrinsically safer traffic environment. To accommodate a safe transition to car use in Thailand, traffic infrastructural changes anticipating the growing car density in urban areas is warranted.","['Accidents, Traffic', 'Adult', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Motorcycles', 'Thailand']",25826214,"[['N06.850.135.392'], ['M01.060.116'], ['E05.318.372.500.750', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['J01.937.500.500'], ['Z01.252.145.841']]","['Health Care [N]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]', 'Geographicals [Z]']",0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,1

Using nuclear run-on experiments, we have determined that the major mechanism for CD4 expression control during development is transcriptional. We have identified a developmental stage- and tissue-specific negative regulatory element in the first intron of the murine CD4 gene that has the characteristics of a transcriptional silencer. The CD4 silencer functions to inhibit marker gene expression at two different stages of T-cell development, as well as in non-T hematopoietic cells, and thus is the critical controlling element responsible for T-cell-specific, as well as developmental- and subclass-specific, expression.","['Animals', 'CD4 Antigens', 'CD8 Antigens', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Enhancer Elements, Genetic', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genetic Markers', 'HLA-B7 Antigen', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Models, Genetic', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Spleen', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets', 'Thymus Gland', 'Transcription, Genetic']",8062832,"[['B01.050'], ['D12.776.543.750.705.852.420.810.500', 'D12.776.543.750.830.700.025', 'D23.050.301.264.894.100', 'D23.101.100.894.100'], ['D23.050.301.264.894.108', 'D23.101.100.894.108'], ['A11.251'], ['G02.111.570.080.689.330', 'G05.360.080.689.330', 'G05.360.340.024.340.137.750.249'], ['G05.308'], ['D23.101.387', 'G05.695.450'], ['D12.776.395.550.489.500.070', 'D12.776.543.550.439.500.070', 'D23.050.301.500.100.500.070', 'D23.050.301.500.450.380.070', 'D23.050.705.552.100.500.070', 'D23.050.705.552.450.380.070'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500'], ['B01.050.050.136.500', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500.800'], ['E05.599.395.397'], ['G02.111.570.080.689.675', 'G05.360.080.689.675', 'G05.360.340.024.340.137.750.680'], ['G02.111.570.080.689', 'G05.360.080.689'], ['A10.549.700', 'A15.382.520.604.700'], ['A11.118.637.555.567.550.500', 'A11.118.637.555.567.569.500', 'A15.145.229.637.555.567.550.500', 'A15.145.229.637.555.567.569.500', 'A15.382.490.555.567.550.500', 'A15.382.490.555.567.569.500'], ['A10.549.750', 'A15.382.520.604.750'], ['G02.111.873', 'G05.297.700']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Structure and expression of three src2 homologues and a novel subfamily of flavoprotein monooxygenase genes revealed by the analysis of a 25kb fragment from Arabidopsis thaliana chromosome IV.,"Biological and computer-assisted analyses of a 25kb fragment from Arabidopsis thaliana chromosome IV led to the characterization of two multigene families and three novel orphan genes, not previously described. The first gene family named AtMO1-4 encodes monooxygenases, related to the prokaryotic salicylate hydroxylases. The second gene family contains three members, two on the analysed 25kb fragment and one on chromosome I. The latter three genes lack introns and are homologous to the previously studied Glycine max src2 gene which is overexpressed at low temperature. Gene expression and primary structure of the deduced proteins are described and compared. Three genes of unknown function, showing tissue specific expressions, are characterized on the 25kb fragment. Full length or partial cognate cDNAs have been sequenced for all the genes studied.","['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Arabidopsis', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Flavoproteins', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Plant', 'Genes, Plant', 'Genes, src', 'Mixed Function Oxygenases', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oxygenases', 'Sequence Alignment']",10216258,"[['G02.111.570.060', 'L01.453.245.667.060'], ['B01.650.940.800.575.912.250.157.100'], ['E05.393.183'], ['E05.393.220'], ['D12.776.331'], ['G05.308.320'], ['G05.308.375'], ['G05.360.340.024.340.393', 'G05.360.340.365.500'], ['G05.360.340.024.340.375.500.791.570'], ['D08.811.682.690.708'], ['L01.453.245.667'], ['D08.811.682.690'], ['E05.393.751']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]']",0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
Effect of recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor on myelopoiesis in the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.,"We administered recombinant (biosynthetic) human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) to 16 patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and leukopenia (2225 +/- 614 cells per microliter [mean +/- SD]). Each patient first received a single intravenous dose; 48 hours later a 14-day continuous intravenous infusion of the agent was begun. The doses used were 1.3 X 10(3) (n = 4), 2.6 X 10(3) (n = 4), 5.2 X 10(3) (n = 4), 1.0 X 10(4) (n = 3), or 2.0 X 10(4) (n = 1) U per kilogram of body weight per day. Administration of recombinant GM-CSF resulted in dose-dependent increases in circulating leukocytes and in increases in circulating neutrophils, eosinophils, and monocytes. The peak leukocyte count ranged from 4575 +/- 2397 cells per microliter at the lowest dose, to 48,700 in the patient receiving the highest dose. Mild side effects--low-grade fever, myalgia, phlebitis, and flushing--were observed in some patients; there were no life-threatening toxic reactions. Our data demonstrate that recombinant human GM-CSF is well tolerated and biologically active in leukopenic patients with AIDS. Strategies to increase the number and function of circulating leukocytes may reduce the morbidity and mortality of infections in these and other patients with leukopenia.","['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Bone Marrow', 'Drug Evaluation', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Recombinant Proteins']",3497344,"[['C01.221.250.875.040', 'C01.221.812.640.400.040', 'C01.778.640.400.040', 'C01.925.782.815.616.400.040', 'C01.925.813.400.040', 'C01.925.839.040', 'C20.673.480.040'], ['M01.060.057'], ['M01.060.116'], ['A15.382.216'], ['E05.290.625', 'E05.337.425'], ['G04.152.825', 'G09.188.343'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D12.644.276.374.410.240.400', 'D12.644.276.374.465.032', 'D12.776.395.240.400', 'D12.776.467.374.410.240.400', 'D12.776.467.374.465.032', 'D23.529.374.410.240.400', 'D23.529.374.465.169'], ['E01.370.225.500.195.107.595', 'E01.370.225.625.107.595', 'E05.200.500.195.107.595', 'E05.200.625.107.595', 'E05.242.195.107.595', 'G04.140.107.595', 'G09.188.105.595'], ['D12.776.828']]","['Diseases [C]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
[Current status of chronic cough treatment in Chinese children].,"OBJECTIVE: To comprehensively understand the current situation of the treatment of chronic cough in Chinese children and provide evidence for a reasonable standard therapy.METHOD: According to the 2008 Guideline of diagnosis and treatment of chronic cough in children that were formulated by The Subspecialty Group of Respiratory Diseases, the Society of Pediatrics, Chinese Medical Association and the Editorial Board of Chinese Journal of Pediatrics, the questionnaire of the cause of chronic cough in children was designed and 29 hospitals in 19 provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions were enrolled. Cases with chronic cough completed 3-month follow-up during May 2009 to April 2010 and information about drug treatment was collected. All data were input through Epidata 3.0 and SPSS19.0 software for statistical analysis.RESULT: Totally 4 529 cases were eligible (the passing rate is 98.8%). The leading three causes were cough variant asthma (CVA), upper airway cough syndrome (UACS) and post-infectious cough (PIC). The drug treatment was given to 3 537 cases (77.2%) at the first visit, and 1 044 cases (22.8%) were not given the treatment but were followed up for observation. In the follow-up period 2 524 cases adhered to medication (55.1%), 2 057 cases (44.9%) failed to adhere to treatment. The leading three medications in CVA patients was leukotriene receptor antagonists (81.68%), antihistamines (50.53%) and beta 2 agonists (37.77%). Follow-up showed that the use of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) was on the rise and by the third month it was listed the second (10.74%). No significant difference (P = 0.092> 0.05) was found among the the effect of drugs used alone but there was significant difference among combinations (P = 0.006). Beta 2 agonists play a special role in the diagnosis and treatment of CVA. In UACS children, 49.80% cases used antimicrobial agents at first visit. Follow-up showed rapid decrease of antimicrobial usage and ICS use increased to the second position. Antihistamines and leukotriene combined with inhaled corticosteroids scheme had the best effect, 61.35% of PIC children were already given antimicrobial drugs before enrollment, compared with CVA (P = 0.000 1) and the utilization rate declined with a clear diagnosis. The effects of beta lactams and macrolides had no significant difference (P = 0.052).CONCLUSION: The choices of treatment for chronic cough in Chinese children are diverse, which is related to overlapping in etiology, diagnosis and the regional drug sources and habits in use of drugs. Currently, leukotriene receptor antagonists are at the first place in children with chronic cough medicine, but its effect was not significantly different from those of beta 2 agonists, antihistamines monotherapy. ICS has not been widely recognized in the treatment of children with chronic cough, even in the CVA. Rational use of antimicrobial agents has been improved. Pediatricians' understanding of chronic cough is being improved. We emphasize the principle of watching, waiting and follow-up in children with chronic cough. Effect on the determination of some CVA patients 1 to 3 months follow-up period is still too inadequate and may be considered appropriate to extend, while cases of multiple etiologies need to extend more observation and waiting time.","['Adrenal Cortex Hormones', 'Adrenergic beta-2 Receptor Agonists', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Asthma', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'China', 'Chronic Disease', 'Cough', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Histamine H1 Antagonists', 'Humans', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Leukotriene Antagonists', 'Treatment Outcome']",24824384,"[['D06.472.040'], ['D27.505.519.625.050.100.200.200', 'D27.505.696.577.050.100.200.200'], ['E05.318.740.150', 'N05.715.360.750.125', 'N06.850.520.830.150'], ['C08.127.108', 'C08.381.495.108', 'C08.674.095', 'C20.543.480.680.095'], ['M01.060.406'], ['M01.060.406.448'], ['Z01.252.474.164'], ['C23.550.291.500'], ['C08.618.248', 'C23.888.852.293'], ['E02.319.283'], ['E02.319.310'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.249', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.350', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.350'], ['D27.505.519.625.375.425.400', 'D27.505.696.577.375.425.400'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C20.543'], ['D06.347.565', 'D27.505.696.399.450.565'], ['E01.789.800', 'N04.761.559.590.800', 'N05.715.360.575.575.800']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Organisms [B]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1
Lipids and lipoproteins among Ethiopian immigrants: comparison of operations Solomon and Moses.,"Lipid and lipoprotein levels and body mass index were compared between two immigrations of Ethiopian Jews to Israel. Those who came in Operation Moses in 1984-85 were survivors of a long trek across hundreds of kilometers and severe food deprivation. Those who immigrated in Operation Solomon in 1991 were bussed from their villages to Addis Ababa where public health care and food were provided and a few months later they were airlifted to Israel. Total cholesterol among the Operation Solomon immigrants was higher than those obtained in Operation Moses in the different age-groups studied, in both sexes. High density lipoprotein-cholesterol was significantly higher and triglycerides lower in Operation Solomon compared with those of Operation Moses. Body mass indices of the Ethiopians in both immigrations were significantly lower than in the Israeli-born population but those who arrived in 1991 were heavier than those in the 1984-85 Operation Moses. The data on the Ethiopian Jews who arrived in Operation Solomon were not affected by the environmental hardships experienced by those who arrived in the 1984-85 Operation Moses. Therefore their exposure to a Western life-style, such as smoking, contraceptive use, change in diet and its effect on arteriosclerosis, diabetes mellitus and coronary heart disease will be of great interest.","['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Body Mass Index', 'Child', 'Emigration and Immigration', 'Ethiopia', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Israel', 'Jews', 'Lipids', 'Lipoproteins', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Time Factors']",8349449,"[['M01.060.057'], ['M01.060.116'], ['E01.370.600.115.100.125', 'E05.041.124.125', 'G07.100.100.125', 'N06.850.505.200.100.175'], ['M01.060.406'], ['I01.240.600.525.500', 'N01.224.625.525.500', 'N06.850.505.400.700.525.500'], ['Z01.058.290.120.310'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['Z01.252.245.500.375'], ['M01.686.754.600'], ['D10'], ['D10.532', 'D12.776.521'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['G01.910.857']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]']",0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1
Vital records in the development of injury control research.,"Most of the resources of the emergency physician are devoted to persons already injured, with little emphasis on prevention. Analyses of state and local injury statistics are necessary to identify local prevention needs in order to set program priorities. We discuss an example, an analysis of statewide injury fatalities identified through the Illinois Vital Records database. The overall death rate for injuries in illinois was lower than that found for the United States. However, the need for research on several high-risk age groups for certain injuries was identified. Most notably, the homicide rate for those 15 to 24 years old was 140% of the national rate. Other specific nonwhite age groups were overrepresented in poisoning, fire, and firearm deaths, while specific white age groups were overrepresented in suicide, fall, and drowning deaths. The research regarding the etiologies of these injuries and the formulation and evaluation of prevention strategies based on this research must be interdisciplinary. The emergency physician is in a unique position to serve as a member of such an interdisciplinary injury control team, but currently there is little emphasis on or training for this role.","['African Americans', 'Age Factors', 'Cause of Death', 'Emergencies', 'European Continental Ancestry Group', 'Humans', 'Illinois', 'Sex Factors', 'Vital Statistics', 'Wounds and Injuries']",2923338,"[['M01.686.508.100.100', 'M01.686.754.100'], ['N05.715.350.075', 'N06.850.490.250'], ['E05.318.308.985.550.250', 'N01.224.935.698.100', 'N06.850.505.400.975.550.250', 'N06.850.520.308.985.550.250'], ['C23.550.291.781', 'N06.230.100.083', 'N06.850.376'], ['M01.686.508.400'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['Z01.107.567.875.350.350', 'Z01.107.567.875.510.350'], ['N05.715.350.675', 'N06.850.490.875'], ['E05.318.308.985', 'N01.224.935', 'N06.850.505.400.975', 'N06.850.520.308.985'], ['C26']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Geographicals [Z]']",0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1
Effects of benzodiazepine receptor ligands and ethanol in rats trained to discriminate pregnanolone.,"Although GABA(A) receptor positive modulators share many behavioral effects, subtle differences have been detected among their discriminative stimulus effects. The purpose of the present study was to determine the extent of shared discriminative stimulus effects of pregnanolone with various benzodiazepine receptor ligands and with ethanol. Naive male Sprague-Dawley rats were trained to discriminate the endogenous neuroactive steroid pregnanolone (5.6 or 8.0 mg/kg) from vehicle. The benzodiazepine receptor agonists, triazolam and lorazepam, the benzodiazepine receptor partial agonist, bretazenil, the benzodiazepine1 (BZ1) receptor subtype selective agonists, zolpidem and zaleplon and ethanol were tested. Triazolam, lorazepam and bretazenil substituted for pregnanolone. Lorazepam, but not triazolam or bretazenil, decreased response rates at the highest dose tested. Zaleplon completely substituted for pregnanolone with no effect on response rates. Zolpidem substituted for pregnanolone only at a dose that severely disrupted response rates. Ethanol partially substituted for pregnanolone and decreased response rates. The results are consistent with GABA(A) receptor mediation of the discriminative stimulus effects of pregnanolone. The effects on response rates suggest subtle differentiation among the GABA(A) receptor-mediated cues.","['Animals', 'Benzodiazepinones', 'Central Nervous System Depressants', 'Discrimination Learning', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Ethanol', 'GABA Modulators', 'Hypnotics and Sedatives', 'Lorazepam', 'Male', 'Pregnanolone', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Receptors, GABA-A', 'Triazolam']",11164076,"[['B01.050'], ['D03.633.100.079.080.070'], ['D27.505.696.277', 'D27.505.954.427.210'], ['F02.463.425.280'], ['G07.690.773.875', 'G07.690.936.500'], ['D02.033.375'], ['D27.505.519.625.240.500', 'D27.505.696.577.240.500'], ['D27.505.696.277.350', 'D27.505.954.427.210.350'], ['D03.633.100.079.080.070.450'], ['D04.210.500.745.640'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700.750'], ['D12.776.157.530.400.175.562', 'D12.776.157.530.400.400.100.100', 'D12.776.543.550.450.175.562', 'D12.776.543.550.450.500.100.100', 'D12.776.543.585.400.175.562', 'D12.776.543.585.400.500.100.100', 'D12.776.543.750.130.500', 'D12.776.543.750.720.200.300.300'], ['D03.633.100.079.080.900']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",0,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Forearm glucose uptake in cirrhosis and its relationship to glucose tolerance.,"1. Oral glucose-tolerance tests (100 g) were carried out in six patients with stable well-compensated cryptogenic cirrhosis and in 12 control subjects. 2. In confirmation of previous studies, patients with cirrhosis had high post-glucose serum insulin levels and were glucose intolerant (mean incremental glucose area 954 +/- 186 compared with 482 +/- 35 mmol 3 h-1 l-1 in controls; P < 0.05). 3. Forearm arteriovenous differences of glucose and forearm blood flow were measured to estimate the proportion of the glucose load metabolized in peripheral tissues. Values in cirrhotic patients and control subjects (5614 +/- 1630 compared with 5344 +/- 672 mumol of glucose min-1 l-1 of forearm in 3 h) were similar despite higher glucose levels and sustained high insulin levels in the cirrhotic patients. 4. Peak lactate concentrations after glucose were of similar magnitude in the two groups (0.66 +/- 0.12 compared with 0.62 +/- 0.75 mmol/l) but in the patients with cirrhosis the peak occurred later and was more sustained. 5. The glucose intolerance of cirrhosis is primarily due to impaired hepatic retention of the glucose load. Insulin resistance in peripheral tissues may also be important since the higher insulin concentrations found in cirrhotic patients failed to enhance peripheral glucose uptake.","['Adult', 'Blood Glucose', 'Female', 'Forearm', 'Glucose', 'Glucose Tolerance Test', 'Growth Hormone', 'Humans', 'Insulin', 'Insulin Resistance', 'Lactates', 'Liver Cirrhosis', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",7000417,"[['M01.060.116'], ['D09.947.875.359.448.500'], ['A01.378.800.585'], ['D09.947.875.359.448'], ['E01.370.225.124.100.355', 'E01.370.374.355', 'E05.200.124.100.355'], ['D06.472.699.631.525.425', 'D12.644.548.691.525.425'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D06.472.699.587.200.500.625', 'D12.644.548.586.200.500.625'], ['C18.452.394.968.500', 'G07.690.773.984.617'], ['D02.241.511.459'], ['C06.552.630', 'C23.550.355.412'], ['M01.060.116.630']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
[An analysis of the clinical characteristics of patients with chronic hepatitis B superinfected with acute hepatitis E].,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate clinical features of the patients with hepatitis B superinfected with acute hepatitis E (AHE).METHODS: Totally 625 consecutive patients enrolled from Dec 2002 to Dec 2006 were studied retrospectively. All of the patients were subclassified into acute hepatitis E group (AHE=437 cases) and Superinfected Group (S=188 cases), and S group was further divided into the group of chronic hepatitis B superinfected with acute hepatitis E (CHB+AHE, 130 cases) and the group of liver cirrhosis and hepatitis B superinfected with acute hepatitis E (LCB+AHE, 58 cases). In 32 of the 188 superinfected patients the effects of HEV on HBV were observed by comparing the levels of HBV DNA in acute vs. convalescence stages.RESULTS: Compared with the patients with AHE, the superinfected patients had a higher level of total bilirubin (TBil), an elevated frequency of fulminate hepatitis, mortality and a longer period of the mean hospital stay for the cured patients but significantly lower levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), serum albumin and prothrombin activity (PA). Furthermore, the group of LCB+AHE had a higher level of TBil and higher incidences of complications such as ascites, peritonitis, hepatic encephalopathy and disturbance in glycometabolism than the group of CHB+AHE. The follow-up for the superinfected patients showed that 20 of 32 patients (62.5 percent) had decreased copies of HBV DNA during the recovery phase compared with the acute phase, and the mean decrease of HBV DNA was 2.1 log10. The HBV DNA was in a persistently undetectable level in 6 of 32 (18.8 percent) superinfected patients. However, 4 of 32 patients (12.5 percent) showed an unchanged levels of HBV DNA and 2 cases (6.2 percent) had a slightly increased HBV DNA levels.CONCLUSION: Superinfection with AHE in patients with chronic hepatitis B leads to a more severe hepatic damage and the replication of HBV DNA can be transiently inhibited.","['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'DNA, Viral', 'Female', 'Hepatitis B, Chronic', 'Hepatitis E', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Virus Replication']",18322591,"[['C23.550.291.125'], ['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['D13.444.308.568'], ['C01.221.250.500.100', 'C01.925.256.430.400.100', 'C01.925.440.435.100', 'C06.552.380.350.100', 'C06.552.380.705.437.100'], ['C01.925.440.470', 'C01.925.782.455', 'C06.552.380.705.470'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['G06.920.925']]","['Diseases [C]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",0,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
Risk Factor Analysis of the Incidence of Subsequent Adjacent Vertebral Fracture After Lumbar Spinal Fusion Surgery with Instrumentation.,"OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the risk factors for adjacent vertebral compression fractures after lumbar spinal fusion with instrumentation.METHODS: A total of 669 patients who received lumbar instrumented spinal fusion between January 2012 and December 2015 were divided into 2 groups according to whether the adjacent vertebral body was fractured. The covariates recorded were age, sex, bone mineral density, and the number of fixed segments. The anatomic variables were pelvic incidence angle (PI), preoperative lumbar lordosis angle (Pre-LL), postoperative lumbar lordosis angle (Post-LL), Pre-LL minus Post-LL (Loss of LL), postoperative pelvic tilt (Post-PT), postoperative sacral slope, Pre-PI-LL mismatch (Pre-PI minus Pre-LL), and Post-PI-LL mismatch (Post-PI minus Post-LL). A 1-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed with the aforementioned parameters, and binary logistic regression analysis was used to determine the relative risk factors.RESULTS: The 669 patients were followed-up for a mean of 2.7 ± 1.1 years (range, 2-4 years). Twenty-seven patients demonstrated fractures in the adjacent vertebral body after surgery. Analysis by 1-way ANOVA demonstrated that age, PI, Pre-LL, Post-LL, Loss of LL, Post-PI-LL mismatch, Post-PT, and osteoporosis were potential risk factors (all parameters, P < 0.001). Furthermore, binary logistic regression analysis showed that a large Loss of LL, osteoporosis, and old age were also risk factors for adjacent vertebral compression fractures.CONCLUSIONS: A greater Loss of LL, osteoporosis, and advanced age may be risk factors for fractures in the adjacent vertebral body of the fixed segment after lumbar fusion fixation.","['Adult', 'Aged', 'Factor Analysis, Statistical', 'Female', 'Fractures, Compression', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Lumbar Vertebrae', 'Lumbosacral Region', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Risk Factors', 'Spinal Fractures', 'Spinal Fusion', 'Treatment Outcome']",31715415,"[['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['E05.318.740.400', 'N05.715.360.750.350', 'N06.850.520.830.400'], ['C26.404.195'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E05.318.308.985.525.375', 'N01.224.935.597.500', 'N06.850.505.400.975.525.375', 'N06.850.520.308.985.525.375'], ['A02.835.232.834.519'], ['A01.923.176.519'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['E05.318.740.600.800.725', 'N05.715.350.200.700', 'N05.715.360.750.625.700.700', 'N06.850.490.625.750', 'N06.850.520.830.600.800.725'], ['C26.117.500.500', 'C26.404.812'], ['E04.555.100.700'], ['E01.789.800', 'N04.761.559.590.800', 'N05.715.360.575.575.800']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
Effects of an injectable platelet-rich fibrin on osteoblast behavior and bone tissue formation in comparison to platelet-rich plasma.,"Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) has been utilized for many years as a regenerative agent capable of inducing vascularization of various tissues using blood-derived growth factors. Despite this, drawbacks mostly related to the additional use of anti-coagulants found in PRP have been shown to inhibit the wound healing process. For these reasons, a novel platelet concentrate has recently been developed with no additives by utilizing lower centrifugation speeds. The purpose of this study was therefore to investigate osteoblast behavior of this novel therapy (injectable-platelet-rich fibrin; i-PRF, 100% natural with no additives) when compared to traditional PRP. Human primary osteoblasts were cultured with either i-PRF or PRP and compared to control tissue culture plastic. A live/dead assay, migration assay as well as a cell adhesion/proliferation assay were investigated. Furthermore, osteoblast differentiation was assessed by alkaline phosphatase (ALP), alizarin red and osteocalcin staining, as well as real-time PCR for genes encoding Runx2, ALP, collagen1 and osteocalcin. The results showed that all cells had high survival rates throughout the entire study period irrespective of culture-conditions. While PRP induced a significant 2-fold increase in osteoblast migration, i-PRF demonstrated a 3-fold increase in migration when compared to control tissue-culture plastic and PRP. While no differences were observed for cell attachment, i-PRF induced a significantly higher proliferation rate at three and five days when compared to PRP. Furthermore, i-PRF induced significantly greater ALP staining at 7 days and alizarin red staining at 14 days. A significant increase in mRNA levels of ALP, Runx2 and osteocalcin, as well as immunofluorescent staining of osteocalcin was also observed in the i-PRF group when compared to PRP. In conclusion, the results from the present study favored the use of the naturally-formulated i-PRF when compared to traditional PRP with anti-coagulants. Further investigation into the direct role of fibrin and leukocytes contained within i-PRF are therefore warranted to better elucidate their positive role in i-PRF on tissue wound healing.","['Blood Platelets', 'Bone Regeneration', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Movement', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Survival', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Humans', 'Osteoblasts', 'Osteogenesis', 'Platelet-Rich Fibrin', 'Platelet-Rich Plasma', 'Wound Healing']",28351189,"[['A11.118.188', 'A15.145.229.188'], ['G11.427.213.140', 'G16.762.150.150'], ['G04.022'], ['G04.152'], ['G04.198', 'G07.568.500.180'], ['G04.161.750', 'G07.345.249.410.750'], ['G04.346'], ['A11.251'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['A11.329.629'], ['G07.345.500.325.377.625.050.500.729', 'G11.427.578.050.500.729'], ['A12.207.152.693.600.500', 'A12.207.270.695.600.500', 'A15.145.693.600.500'], ['A12.207.152.693.600', 'A12.207.270.695.600', 'A15.145.693.600'], ['G16.762.891']]","['Anatomy [A]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]']",1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Chemical and statistical interpretation of sized aerosol particles collected at an urban site in Thessaloniki, Greece.","The size distribution of aerosol particles (PM0.015-PM18) in relation to their soluble inorganic species and total water soluble organic compounds (WSOC) was investigated at an urban site of Thessaloniki, Northern Greece. The sampling period was from February to July 2007. The determined compounds were compared with mass concentrations of the PM fractions for nano (N: 0.015 < Dp < 0.06), ultrafine (UFP: 0.015 < Dp < 0.125), fine (FP: 0.015 < Dp < 2.0) and coarse particles (CP: 2.0 < Dp < 8.0) in order to perform mass closure of the water soluble content for the respective fractions. Electrolytes were the dominant species in all fractions (24-27%), followed by WSOC (16-23%). The water soluble inorganic and organic content was found to account for 53% of the nanoparticle, 48% of the ultrafine particle, 45% of the fine particle and 44% of the coarse particle mass. Correlations between the analyzed species were performed and the effect of local and long-range transported emissions was examined by wind direction and backward air mass trajectories. Multivariate statistical analysis (cluster analysis and principal components analysis) of the collected data was performed in order to reveal the specific data structure. Possible sources of air pollution were identified and an attempt is made to find patterns of similarity between the different sized aerosols and the seasons of monitoring. It was proven that several major latent factors are responsible for the data structure despite the size of the aerosols - mineral (soil) dust, sea sprays, secondary emissions, combustion sources and industrial impact. The seasonal separation proved to be not very specific.","['Aerosols', 'Air Movements', 'Air Pollutants', 'Chromatography, Ion Exchange', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Environmental Monitoring', 'Greece', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Particle Size', 'Particulate Matter', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Seasons', 'Solubility']",24007436,"[['D20.280.055', 'D26.255.165.055'], ['G16.500.175.249', 'G16.500.275.063.725.154', 'N06.230.300.100.150.185'], ['D27.888.284.101'], ['E05.196.181.400.383'], ['E05.318.740.250', 'N05.715.360.750.200', 'N06.850.520.830.250'], ['N06.850.460.350.080', 'N06.850.780.375'], ['Z01.542.383'], ['E05.318.740.150.500', 'N05.715.360.750.125.500', 'N06.850.520.830.150.500'], ['G02.712'], ['D20.633'], ['E05.318.740.562'], ['G01.910.645.661', 'G16.500.275.071.590', 'N06.230.300.100.250.525'], ['G02.805']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Geographicals [Z]']",0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1

Three-dimensional mapping of cortical thickness using Laplace's equation.,"We present a novel, computerized method of examining cerebral cortical thickness. The normal cortex varies in thickness from 2 to 4 mm, reflecting the morphology of neuronal sublayers. Cortical pathologies often manifest abnormal variations in thickness, with examples of Alzheimer's disease and cortical dysplasia as thin and thick cortex, respectively. Radiologically, images are 2-D slices through a highly convoluted 3-D object. Depending on the relative orientation of the slices with respect to the object, it is impossible to deduce abnormal cortical thickness without additional information from neighboring slices. We approach the problem by applying Laplace's Equation (V2psi = 0) from mathematical physics. The volume of the cortex is represented as the domain for the solution of the differential equation, with separate boundary conditions at the gray-white junction and the gray-CSF junction. Normalized gradients of psi form a vector field, representing tangent vectors along field lines connecting both boundaries. We define the cortical thickness at any point in the cortex to be the pathlength along such lines. Key advantages of this method are that it is fully three-dimensional, and the thickness is uniquely defined for any point in the cortex. We present graphical results that map cortical thickness everywhere in a normal brain. Results show global variations in cortical thickness consistent with known neuroanatomy. The application of this technique to visualization of cortical thickness in brains with known pathology has broad clinical implications.","['Algorithms', 'Brain Mapping', 'Cerebral Cortex', 'Humans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Models, Neurological']",10997850,"[['G17.035', 'L01.224.050'], ['E01.370.350.578.875.500', 'E01.370.376.537.625.500', 'E05.629.875.500'], ['A08.186.211.200.885.287.500'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E01.370.350.825.500'], ['E05.599.395.642']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Organisms [B]']",1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
Glutamate ameliorates experimental vincristine neuropathy.,"The dose-limiting toxicity of the chemotherapeutic agent vincristine is peripheral neuropathy, for which there is no established therapy. The amino acid glutamate has been proposed as a neuroprotectant for vincristine, but a full preclinical evaluation of its efficacy, safety and mechanism of action has been hampered by a lack of suitable animal models. We report the development of a Dark Agouti rat model of sensorimotor peripheral neuropathy, to investigate the neurotoxicity of cytotoxic drugs. Neuropathy was manifested as gait disturbance in 100% of vincristine-treated animals (n = 12), significant elevation of the tail-flick threshold (5.1 +/- 2 sec) and significantly impaired mean Rotarod times (55 +/- 41 sec) developing after administration of 1.5 mg/kg vincristine over 2 weeks. Among vincristine-treated animals supplemented p.o. with sodium glutamate (500 mg/kg/day in drinking water) from 24 hr before vincristine treatment, only one (8%, P = .01) developed gait disturbance, the tall-flick threshold was not significantly different from controls and the mean Rotarod score was 188 +/- 18 sec (P = .004). Glutamate thus significantly protected against both sensory and motor neuropathy. We observed no intrinsic neurotoxicity with glutamate and no interference with the cytotoxic efficacy of vincristine against a transplantable rat mammary adenocarcinoma grown s.c. in Dark Agouti rats. Our findings suggest that glutamate is likely to be a safe and effective neuroprotectant for patients receiving vincristine, and it warrants further clinical evaluation. The mechanism of this selective neuroprotection by glutamate remains to be elucidated. Our rat model may be of use in determining whether glutamate offers protection from other neurotoxic drugs.","['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic', 'Female', 'Gait', 'Glutamic Acid', 'Motor Activity', 'Neoplasms, Experimental', 'Neuroprotective Agents', 'Peripheral Nervous System Diseases', 'Rats', 'Sensory Thresholds', 'Vincristine']",8859020,"[['B01.050'], ['D27.505.954.248.179'], ['E01.370.600.250', 'G11.427.410.568.900.750'], ['D12.125.067.625.349', 'D12.125.119.409.349', 'D12.125.427.300'], ['F01.145.632', 'G11.427.410.698'], ['C04.619', 'E05.598.500.496'], ['D27.505.696.706.548', 'D27.505.954.427.575'], ['C10.668.829'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700'], ['F02.463.593.710'], ['D03.132.436.681.827.817', 'D03.633.100.473.402.681.827.817', 'D03.633.100.496.500.500.681.827.817']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Diseases [C]']",0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Pharmaceutical and pharmacokinetic evaluation of a novel fast dissolving film formulation of flupentixol dihydrochloride.,"The objective of the present study was to develop fast dissolving oral film of the antipsychotic drug, flupentixol dihydrochloride, to enhance its bioavailability, optimize its therapeutic effect when used to treat depression with anxiety, and increase the convenience and compliance by the mentally ill, developmentally disable, elderly, and pediatric patients. Six formulae were prepared with different concentrations of water-soluble polymers vis. hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC E5) and carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) by solvent casting technique. The prepared films were subjected to characterization for folding endurance, weight variations, thickness, disintegration time, drug release pattern, and drug content. Physical compatibility between the drug and excipients was guaranteed in the selected formulation (2% HPMC) by means of differential scanning calorimetry analysis and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy. This formulation revealed high stability after testing according to the International Conference on Harmonisation guidelines. In vivo studies based on single phase parallel design were carried out for the optimized formulation in healthy human volunteers. The concentration of flupentixol dihydrochloride in plasma samples was analyzed by a developed validated LC-MS/MS assay method and the pharmacokinetic parameters of the established formulation were compared with the commercially available oral tablets. Faster rate of absorption of flupentixol could be obtained from the oral film formulation and the relative bioavailability was found to be 151.06% compared to the marketed product.","['Administration, Oral', 'Adult', 'Antipsychotic Agents', 'Biological Availability', 'Calorimetry, Differential Scanning', 'Carboxymethylcellulose Sodium', 'Chemistry, Pharmaceutical', 'Chromatography, Liquid', 'Excipients', 'Flupenthixol', 'Humans', 'Hypromellose Derivatives', 'Male', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Solubility', 'Spectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared', 'Tablets', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry', 'Technology, Pharmaceutical', 'Young Adult']",25142820,"[['E02.319.267.100'], ['M01.060.116'], ['D27.505.696.277.950.040', 'D27.505.954.427.210.950.040', 'D27.505.954.427.700.872.331'], ['G03.787.151', 'G07.690.725.129'], ['E05.196.131.310', 'E05.196.370.310'], ['D09.698.365.180.663.329'], ['H01.158.703.007', 'H01.181.466'], ['E05.196.181.400'], ['D26.650.700.419', 'D27.720.744.770.419'], ['D02.886.952.360', 'D03.383.606.460', 'D03.633.300.953.704.360'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D05.750.078.562.180.357', 'D09.698.365.180.455', 'D25.720.099.500.719', 'J01.637.051.720.099.500.719'], ['E05.318.370.725', 'E05.337.851', 'N05.715.360.325.685', 'N06.850.520.445.725'], ['G02.805'], ['E05.196.712.726.676.700', 'E05.196.867.826.676.700'], ['D26.255.830'], ['E05.196.566.880'], ['E05.916', 'J01.897.836'], ['M01.060.116.815']]","['Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]', 'Health Care [N]']",0,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,0
Intensity-modulated radiation therapy with concurrent chemotherapy as preoperative treatment for localized gastric adenocarcinoma.,"PURPOSE: The goal of this study was to evaluate dosimetric parameters, acute toxicity, pathologic response, and local control in patients treated with preoperative intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and concurrent chemotherapy for localized gastric adenocarcinoma.METHODS: Between November 2007 and April 2010, 25 patients with localized gastric adenocarcinoma were treated with induction chemotherapy, followed by preoperative IMRT and concurrent chemotherapy and, finally, surgical resection. The median radiation therapy dose was 45 Gy. Concurrent chemotherapy was 5-fluorouracil and oxaliplatin in 18 patients, capecitabine in 3, and other regimens in 4. Subsequently, resection was performed with total gastrectomy in 13 patients, subtotal gastrectomy in 7, and other surgeries in 5.RESULTS: Target coverage, expressed as the ratio of the minimum dose received by 99% of the planning target volume to the prescribed dose, was a median of 0.97 (range, 0.92-1.01). The median V(30) (percentage of volume receiving at least 30 Gy) for the liver was 26%; the median V(20) (percentage of volume receiving at least 20 Gy) for the right and left kidneys was 14% and 24%, respectively; and the median V(40) (percentage of volume receiving at least 40 Gy) for the heart was 18%. Grade 3 acute toxicity developed in 14 patients (56%), including dehydration in 10, nausea in 8, and anorexia in 5. Grade 4 acute toxicity did not develop in any patient. There were no significant differences in the rates of acute toxicity, hospitalization, or feeding tube use in comparison to those in a group of 50 patients treated with preoperative three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy with concurrent chemotherapy. R0 resection was obtained in 20 patients (80%), and pathologic complete response occurred in 5 (20%).CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative IMRT for gastric adenocarcinoma was well tolerated, accomplished excellent target coverage and normal structure sparing, and led to appropriate pathologic outcomes.","['Adenocarcinoma', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Anorexia', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols', 'Capecitabine', 'Chemoradiotherapy', 'Dehydration', 'Deoxycytidine', 'Docetaxel', 'Female', 'Fluorouracil', 'Gastrectomy', 'Heart', 'Humans', 'Induction Chemotherapy', 'Kidney', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nausea', 'Organoplatinum Compounds', 'Oxaliplatin', 'Preoperative Care', 'Radiotherapy Dosage', 'Radiotherapy, Intensity-Modulated', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Stomach Neoplasms', 'Taxoids', 'Treatment Outcome']",22137021,"[['C04.557.470.200.025'], ['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['C23.888.821.108'], ['E02.183.750.500', 'E02.319.077.500', 'E02.319.310.037'], ['D03.383.742.680.245.500.425', 'D03.383.742.698.875.404.425', 'D13.570.230.329.313', 'D13.570.685.245.500.425'], ['E02.186.079', 'E02.319.164', 'E02.815.160'], ['C18.452.950.179', 'C23.550.274'], ['D03.383.742.680.245.500', 'D13.570.230.329', 'D13.570.685.245.500'], ['D02.455.426.392.368.242.888.389', 'D02.455.849.291.850.389'], ['D03.383.742.698.875.404'], ['E04.210.419'], ['A07.541'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E02.319.499', 'E02.860.500'], ['A05.810.453'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['C23.888.821.712'], ['D02.691.788'], ['D02.257.750'], ['E02.760.795', 'E04.604.750', 'N02.421.585.795'], ['E02.815.639'], ['E02.815.635.700.700', 'L01.313.500.750.100.710.600.550.700'], ['E05.318.372.500.500.500', 'E05.318.372.500.750.750', 'N05.715.360.330.500.500.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.825', 'N06.850.520.450.500.500.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.825'], ['C04.588.274.476.767', 'C06.301.371.767', 'C06.405.249.767', 'C06.405.748.789'], ['D02.455.426.392.368.242.888', 'D02.455.849.291.850'], ['E01.789.800', 'N04.761.559.590.800', 'N05.715.360.575.575.800']]","['Diseases [C]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Information Science [L]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0
Predation mechanisms of Rapana venosa (Gastropoda: Muricidae) in different biotopes along the Black Sea coast.,"Mechanisms of feeding by the invasive gastropod Rapana venosa from different biotopes of 11 sites along the Black Sea coast are discussed. Two methods--edge-drilling and suffocation--are used, but the prevailing method in a particular biotope depends on the type of bivalve prey. Drill signs were present on almost all shells of Chamelea gallina, captured by rapa whelks in field conditions, while in a field experiment, only 11% of all empty Mytilus galloprovincialis had drilling signatures. The degree of radula abrasion was also dependent on the available bivalves: it was the highest in biotopes with C. gallina and juvenile mussels, and the lowest in biotopes with large mussels. Intermediate degrees of abrasion were observed in biotopes with mixed prey: C. gallina and Anadara kagoshimensis, C. gallina and mussels, or small and large mussels. Since we observed only initial signs of drilling, simultaneous application of boring and suffocation could take place.","['Animals', 'Bivalvia', 'Black Sea', 'Food Chain', 'Gastropoda', 'Introduced Species', 'Predatory Behavior', 'Russia', 'Ukraine']",26242971,"[['B01.050'], ['B01.050.500.644.080'], ['Z01.756.217'], ['G16.500.275.157.250', 'N06.230.124.250'], ['B01.050.500.644.400'], ['B01.050.050.580', 'G16.500.275.157.049.400', 'N06.230.124.049.400'], ['F01.145.113.111.600', 'F01.145.113.252.520'], ['Z01.252.122.500', 'Z01.542.248.775'], ['Z01.542.248.960', 'Z01.542.931.960', 'Z01.586.950.960']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]']",0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1
Runoff transport of pyrethroids from a residential lawn in central California.,"An irrigation runoff study on a residential lawn was conducted in California, northeast of Sacramento, during the summer and fall of 2008 to investigate the contribution of turf uses of pyrethroids to residues in Californian urban creek sediments. This study examined how over irrigation (i.e., irrigation that produces runoff) in the summer season may transport recently applied pyrethroids. The study included liquid and granular applications of both bifenthrin [(2-methyl-3-phenyl-phenyl) methyl 3-(2-chloro-3,3,3-trifluoro-prop-1-enyl)-2,2-dimethyl-cyclopropane-1-carboxylate] and beta-cyfluthrin [Cyano(4-fluoro-3-phenoxyphenyl)methyl 3-(2,2-dichloroethenyl)-2,2-dimethyl-cyclopropanecarboxylate]. Generally, runoff did not occur at irrigation rates of 2.03 cm/h (0.8 in/h) but did occur when the irrigation rates were increased to about 3.81 cm/h (1.5 in/h), generating chemical losses in the first runoff event of up to 0.58 and 0.08% of applied for beta-cyfluthrin and bifenthrin, respectively. Chemical runoff losses dropped significantly between over-irrigation events with the third over-irrigation event chemical runoff losses representing 0.026 and 0.015% of applied for beta-cyfluthrin and bifenthrin, respectively. Runoff losses were generally less for liquid formulations than granular formulations but within a factor of three. Additionally, the study included a simulated winter rainstorm 8 wk after application. The low runoff losses from turf seen in this study suggest that other sources could be contributing to observed residues in urban streams. Other sources could include pyrethroids ending up on impervious surfaces, such as concrete driveways from off-target applications to turf, spills, and other poor handling practices, or pyrechroids applied directly to impervious surfaces for insect control.","['Animals', 'California', 'Cities', 'Geologic Sediments', 'Insecticides', 'Pyrethrins', 'Seasons', 'Water Movements', 'Water Pollutants, Chemical', 'Water Supply']",21520766,"[['B01.050'], ['Z01.107.567.875.580.200', 'Z01.107.567.875.760.200'], ['G16.500.275.069', 'N06.230.069', 'Z01.433'], ['G01.311.330', 'G16.500.320'], ['D27.720.031.700.491', 'D27.888.723.491'], ['D02.455.849.575.188.750'], ['G01.910.645.661', 'G16.500.275.071.590', 'N06.230.300.100.250.525'], ['G16.500.971', 'N06.230.132.644.750', 'N06.230.850'], ['D27.888.284.903.655'], ['J01.293.821.500']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]']",0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1
Comparison of measured resting energy expenditure versus predictive equations in pediatric burn patients.,"Many equations have been developed to estimate resting energy expenditure (REE) in thermally injured patients. A consensus has not been reached on the accuracy of these equations in children. The purpose of our study was to compare three predictive equations: Harris Benedict x 2 multiplier (HB x 2), Mayes (MG), and the WorId Health Organization x 2 multiplier (WHO x 2) with measured resting energy expenditure x I.3 multiplier (MREE x 1.3) in pediatric burn patients. MREE was measured by open-circuit indirect calorimetry in 10 burned children (6 boys, 4 girls) aged 2 to 10 years with TBSA burn ranges from 35% to 97%. MREE x 1.3 was compared with values obtained by HB x 2, MG, and WHO x 2 predictive equations. When comparing MREE x 1.3 with all three equations, significant differences were found when compared with HB x 2 and MG, but there were no significant difference between MREE x 1.3 vs WHO x 2. The HB x 2 and MG equations overpredicted MREE x 1.3 by 29% and 19%, respectively. Many predictive equations have been developed to predict energy expenditure in burns, but their accuracy in predicting MREE x 1.3 is variable. A larger study comparing/contrasting predictive equations and resting energy expenditure measured by indirect calorimetry is needed to improve the prediction of energy needs in burned children.","['Basal Metabolism', 'Breath Tests', 'Burns', 'Calorimetry, Indirect', 'Carbon Dioxide', 'Child', 'Child Nutritional Physiological Phenomena', 'Child, Preschool', 'Energy Intake', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Nutritional Requirements', 'Oxygen Consumption', 'Retrospective Studies']",16278559,"[['G03.295.154'], ['E01.370.100'], ['C26.200'], ['E05.196.131.655'], ['D01.200.200', 'D01.362.150', 'D01.650.550.200'], ['M01.060.406'], ['G07.203.650.220'], ['M01.060.406.448'], ['G07.203.650.240.340'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['G07.203.650.620'], ['G03.680'], ['E05.318.372.500.500.500', 'E05.318.372.500.750.750', 'N05.715.360.330.500.500.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.825', 'N06.850.520.450.500.500.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.825']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Health Care [N]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
Selectively deposited silver coatings on gold-capped silicon nanowires for surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy.,"Gold caps on silicon nanowires are selectively coated with silver by autometallography (electroless deposition). Changing the conditions of silver deposition, a variety of different coating morphologies can be produced [figure: see text]. The different silver coating morphologies are investigated in terms of their capabilities for surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) experiments.Gold caps on silicon nanowires are hemispherical and only a few tens of nanometers in diameter when grown from metal catalysts by the vapor-liquid-solid growth mechanism using chemical vapor deposition. These gold caps are capable of enhancing Raman signals based on the surface-enhanced Raman scattering effect. The Raman signal can be enhanced even further (by at least one order of magnitude) when silver is selectively deposited onto these gold caps by autometallography (electroless deposition). By changing the silver deposition conditions, different coating morphologies can be realized on the gold caps that range from very thin, smooth layers to uneven and extremely rough coatings. The SERS signal enhancement and the spatial homogeneity of the achievable enhancement are compared for the different silver coatings using a model dye molecule.","['Gold', 'Nanowires', 'Silicon', 'Silver', 'Spectrum Analysis, Raman']",19399821,"[['D01.268.556.322', 'D01.268.956.186', 'D01.552.544.322'], ['J01.637.512.925'], ['D01.268.513.937'], ['D01.268.556.812', 'D01.268.956.843', 'D01.552.544.812'], ['E05.196.822.860', 'E05.196.867.890']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
Polypharmacy in nursing home residents in the United States: results of the 2004 National Nursing Home Survey.,"BACKGROUND: Despite the need for and benefits of medications, polypharmacy (defined here as concurrent use of > or =9 medications) in nursing home residents is a concern. As the number of medications taken increases, so does the risk for adverse events. Monitoring polypharmacy in this population is important and can improve the quality of nursing home care.OBJECTIVES: The aims of this article were to estimate the use of polypharmacy in residents of nursing homes in the United States, to examine the associations between select resident and facility characteristics and polypharmacy, and to determine the leading therapeutic subclasses included in the polypharmacy received by these nursing home residents.METHODS: This was a retrospective, cross-sectional study of a nationally representative sample of US nursing home residents in 2004; the outcome was use of polypharmacy. The 2004 National Nursing Home Survey was used to collect medication data and other resident and facility information. Resident characteristics included age, sex, race, primary payment source, number of comorbidities, number of activities of daily living (ADLs) for which the resident required assistance, and length of stay (LOS) since admission. Facility characteristics included ownership and size (number of beds).RESULTS: Of 13,507 nursing home residents who received care, 13,403 had valid responses for all 9 independent variables in the analyses. The prevalence of polypharmacy among nursing home residents in 2004 was approximately 40%. A multiple regression model controlling for resident and facility factors revealed that the odds of receiving polypharmacy were higher for residents who were female (odds ratio [OR] = 1.10; 95% CI, 1.00-1.20), were white, had Medicaid as a primary payer, had >3 comorbidities (OR = 1.57-5.18; 95% CI, 1.36-6.15), needed assistance with < or =4 ADLs, had an LOS since admission of 3 to <6 months (OR = 1.25; 95% CI, 1.04-1.50), and received care in a small, not- for-profit facility (data not shown for reference levels [OR = 1.00]). The most frequently reported medications for residents who received polypharmacy included gastrointestinal agents (laxatives, 47.5%; agents for acid/peptic disorders, 43.3%), drugs that affect the central nervous system (antidepressants, 46.3%; antipsychotics or antimanics, 25.9%), and pain relievers (nonnarcotic analgesics, 43.6%; antipyretics, 41.2%; antiarthritics, 31.2%).CONCLUSIONS: Despite awareness of polypharmacy and its potential consequences in older patients, results of our analysis suggest that polypharmacy remains widespread in US nursing homes. Although complex medication regimens are often necessary for nursing home residents, monitoring polypharmacy and its consequences may improve the quality of nursing home care and reduce unnecessary health care spending related to adverse events.","['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Female', 'Health Care Surveys', 'Homes for the Aged', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nursing Homes', 'Polypharmacy', 'Retrospective Studies', 'United States']",20226393,"[['M01.060.116.100'], ['M01.060.116.100.080'], ['E05.318.372.500.875', 'N05.715.360.330.500.875', 'N06.850.520.450.500.875'], ['E05.318.308.980.344', 'N03.349.380.210', 'N05.425.210', 'N05.715.360.300.800.344', 'N06.850.520.308.980.344'], ['J03.775.462', 'N02.278.825.462'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['N02.278.825.610'], ['E02.319.698'], ['E05.318.372.500.500.500', 'E05.318.372.500.750.750', 'N05.715.360.330.500.500.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.825', 'N06.850.520.450.500.500.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.825'], ['Z01.107.567.875']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Geographicals [Z]']",0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,1
Examining the proteins of functional retinal lipofuscin using proteomic analysis as a guide for understanding its origin.,"PURPOSE: To elucidate the origins of biologically active retinal lipofuscin (RLF) by examining its protein composition.METHODS: Total protein and total lipid were extracted and quantified. Proteins in this lipoprotein granule were identified by limited-scale proteomic analysis using both two-dimensional (2D) gel electrophoresis and SDS-PAGE coupled with MALDI-QqToF MSMS and automated LCMSMS, respectively.RESULTS: RLF granules were 44% protein and 50% lipid. Proteomic analyses identified 41 constituent proteins. Hydrophobic proteins and several proteins specific to photoreceptors, including rhodopsin, that have not previously been reported, were identified. Extensive protein modification, especially oxidative damage, was observed.CONCLUSIONS: Proteins identified support the model that RLF accumulates in RPE cells as a result of the buildup of undigested material from the phagocytosis of photoreceptor outer segments. Perhaps oxidative damage renders some of these proteins indigestible and thus leads to the accumulation of RLF granules.","['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Electrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Lipofuscin', 'Microscopy, Electron, Scanning', 'Microscopy, Immunoelectron', 'Middle Aged', 'Pigment Epithelium of Eye', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'Spectrometry, Fluorescence', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization']",16379024,"[['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['M01.060.116.100.080'], ['E05.196.401.250', 'E05.301.300.230'], ['E05.196.401.402', 'E05.301.300.319'], ['E01.370.225.500.363.342', 'E01.370.225.500.386.350', 'E05.196.712.516.600.240.350', 'E05.200.500.363.342', 'E05.200.500.386.350', 'E05.242.363.342', 'E05.242.386.350'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D10.460', 'D23.767.550'], ['E01.370.350.515.402.541', 'E05.595.402.541'], ['E01.370.350.515.402.625', 'E05.595.402.625'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['A09.371.670', 'A10.272.640'], ['D12.776.817'], ['H01.158.201.843', 'H01.158.273.180.350.700', 'H01.158.273.343.350.700', 'H01.181.122.738'], ['E05.196.712.516.600.676', 'E05.196.867.726'], ['E05.196.566.755']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0
Association between metabolic syndrome and intravesical prostatic protrusion in patients with benign prostatic enlargement and lower urinary tract symptoms (MIPS Study).,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association between metabolic syndrome (MetS) and morphological features of benign prostatic enlargement (BPE), including total prostate volume (TPV), transitional zone volume (TZV) and intravesical prostatic protrusion (IPP).PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between January 2015 and January 2017, 224 consecutive men aged >50 years presenting with lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) suggestive of BPE were recruited to this multicentre cross-sectional study. MetS was defined according to International Diabetes Federation criteria. Multivariate linear and logistic regression models were performed to verify factors associated with IPP, TZV and TPV.RESULTS: Patients with MetS were observed to have a significant increase in IPP (P < 0.01), TPV (P < 0.01) and TZV (P = 0.02). On linear regression analysis, adjusted for age and metabolic factors of MetS, we found that high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol was negatively associated with IPP (r = -0.17), TPV (r = -0.19) and TZV (r = -0.17), while hypertension was positively associated with IPP (r = 0.16), TPV (r = 0.19) and TZV (r = 0.16). On multivariate logistic regression analysis adjusted for age and factors of MetS, hypertension (categorical; odds ratio [OR] 2.95), HDL cholesterol (OR 0.94) and triglycerides (OR 1.01) were independent predictors of TPV ? 40 mL. We also found that HDL cholesterol (OR 0.86), hypertension (OR 2.0) and waist circumference (OR 1.09) were significantly associated with TZV ? 20 mL. On age-adjusted logistic regression analysis, MetS was significantly associated with IPP ? 10 mm (OR 34.0; P < 0.01), TZV ? 20 mL (OR 4.40; P < 0.01) and TPV ? 40 mL (OR 5.89; P = 0.03).CONCLUSION: We found an association between MetS and BPE, demonstrating a relationship with IPP.","['Aged', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Humans', 'Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms', 'Male', 'Metabolic Syndrome', 'Middle Aged', 'Organ Size', 'Prognosis', 'Prostate', 'Prostatic Hyperplasia']",28872764,"[['M01.060.116.100'], ['E05.318.372.500.875', 'N05.715.360.330.500.875', 'N06.850.520.450.500.875'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C23.888.942.343'], ['C18.452.394.968.500.570', 'C18.452.625'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['E01.370.600.115.100.660', 'E05.041.124.715', 'G07.100.100.660', 'G07.345.249.690'], ['E01.789'], ['A05.360.444.575', 'A10.336.707'], ['C12.294.565.500']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
Clinical score and arterial oxygen saturation in children with wheezing associated respiratory illness (WARI).,"OBJECTIVES: To determine the correlation between clinical score (based on respiratory rate, chest wall retractions, air entry, wheezing, consciousness and audible wheezing) and arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2: measured by pulse oximetry) as well as the most appropriate total score for predicting hypoxemia (SaO2 < or = 95%) in children diagnosed to have wheezing associated respiratory illness (WARI).SUBJECTS: 70 children (1 month-5 years old) hospitalized in the Department of Pediatrics, Chulalongkorn Hospital with the diagnosis of WARI from January 1, 1996 to December 31, 1996 were studied. Half of them were diagnosed to have acute lower respiratory tract infection (LRI) with wheezing while the remainder had reactive airway disease (RAD).DESIGN: Cross sectional, analytical study.METHODS: In each group of patients, the clinical score and SaO2 were assessed by the same pediatrician throughout the study. The correlation between the clinical signs and SaO2 as well as the cut off point of total score for predicting hypoxemia were analyzed. The sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of that total score in predicting hypoxemia were also calculated.RESULT: In both groups of patients (acute LRI with wheezing and RAD group), the clinical signs correlated with SaO2 were wheezing (rs = -0.67 and -0.47 respectively) and chest wall retractions (rs = -0.57 and -0.59 respectively). Total score was also correlated with SaO2 (rs = -0.68 and -0.5 respectively). The cut off point of total score in predicting hypoxemia was 4 providing 80 per cent sensitivity in both groups with accuracy 74.3 per cent and 80 per cent respectively.CONCLUSION: This clinical score may be used to assess the severity of hypoxemia in WARI patients. Wheezing, chest wall retractions and total score correlated well with SaO2. The total score > 4 was most appropriate in predicting hypoxemia in both children with RAD and wheezing associated with LRI.","['Child, Preschool', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hypoxia', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Linear Models', 'Male', 'Oximetry', 'Oxygen', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'ROC Curve', 'Respiratory Physiological Phenomena', 'Respiratory Sounds', 'Respiratory Tract Diseases', 'Severity of Illness Index']",11143488,"[['M01.060.406.448'], ['E05.318.372.500.875', 'N05.715.360.330.500.875', 'N06.850.520.450.500.875'], ['E01.171'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C23.888.852.079'], ['M01.060.703'], ['M01.060.703.520'], ['E05.318.740.500.500', 'E05.318.740.750.425', 'E05.599.835.750', 'N05.715.360.750.530.460', 'N05.715.360.750.695.460', 'N06.850.520.830.500.500', 'N06.850.520.830.750.425'], ['E01.370.225.124.100.100.600', 'E01.370.370.380.600', 'E01.370.386.700.100.600', 'E05.200.124.100.100.600'], ['D01.268.185.550', 'D01.362.670'], ['E05.318.370.800.650', 'N05.715.360.325.700.640', 'N06.850.520.445.800.650'], ['E05.318.370.800.750', 'E05.318.740.872.750', 'N05.715.360.325.700.680', 'N06.850.520.445.800.750'], ['G09.772'], ['C23.888.852.779', 'E01.370.386.720', 'G09.772.775'], ['C08'], ['E05.318.308.980.438.475.456.500', 'N05.715.360.300.800.438.375.364.500', 'N06.850.520.308.980.438.475.364.500']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
The effect of grandmultiparity on pregnancy related complications: the Aga Khan University experience.,"BACKGROUND: Grandmultiparity has been associated with complications for both mother and the fetus.OBJECTIVE: To evaluate if grandmultiparity is a risk factor in the presence of adequate antenatal care.SETTING: A tertiary care teaching hospital.METHODS: It was a retrospective study conducted in the department of Obstetrics & Gynecology at The Aga Khan University Hospital in Karachi. During this period 9253 women were delivered, out of these 143 booked grandmultiparas (GMP) served as cases. The outcome of these women was compared with 430 non-grandmultiparas (NGMP). Logistic regression model was used to adjust for potential confounders.RESULTS: Grandmultiparas had almost three times increased risk of having postpartum hemorrhage compared to NGMP group. Similarly, there were significantly low five-minute apgars in the GMPs compared to the NGMP group. Although the neonatal intensive care admissions were three times more in the GMPs but this did not reach statistical significance due to small number of cases in both groups.CONCLUSION: Our study indicates that grandmultiparity is a risk factor for pregnancy in this part of the world, even in the presence of reasonable antenatal care. This may be explained on the basis of the increased age of these women. Finally, we also recommend that an age-matched study needs to be undertaken in order to determine if age is an important determinant for risk factors in grandmultiparas.","['Adult', 'Birth Weight', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Logistic Models', 'Maternal Age', 'Parity', 'Postpartum Hemorrhage', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Complications', 'Pregnancy Outcome', 'Prevalence', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors']",10769523,"[['M01.060.116'], ['C23.888.144.186', 'E01.370.600.115.100.160.120.186', 'E05.041.124.160.750.149', 'G07.100.100.160.120.186', 'G07.345.249.314.120.186'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E05.318.740.500.525', 'E05.318.740.600.800.450', 'E05.318.740.750.450', 'E05.599.835.875', 'N05.715.360.750.530.480', 'N05.715.360.750.625.700.450', 'N05.715.360.750.695.470', 'N06.850.520.830.500.525', 'N06.850.520.830.600.800.450', 'N06.850.520.830.750.450'], ['G08.686.560', 'N05.715.350.075.550', 'N06.850.490.250.550'], ['G08.686.677', 'G08.686.784.769.472', 'N06.850.490.812.600'], ['C13.703.420.725', 'C13.703.844.700', 'C23.550.414.993.850'], ['G08.686.784.769'], ['C13.703'], ['E01.789.700', 'G08.686.784.769.496'], ['E05.318.308.985.525.750', 'N01.224.935.597.750', 'N06.850.505.400.975.525.750', 'N06.850.520.308.985.525.750'], ['E05.318.372.500.500.500', 'E05.318.372.500.750.750', 'N05.715.360.330.500.500.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.825', 'N06.850.520.450.500.500.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.825'], ['E05.318.740.600.800.725', 'N05.715.350.200.700', 'N05.715.360.750.625.700.700', 'N06.850.490.625.750', 'N06.850.520.830.600.800.725']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Health Care [N]']",0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0

Effect of Larval Density on Food Utilization Efficiency of Tenebrio molitor (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae).,"Crowding conditions of larvae may have a significant impact on commercial production efficiency of some insects, such as Tenebrio molitor L. (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae). Although larval densities are known to affect developmental time and growth in T. molitor, no reports were found on the effects of crowding on food utilization. The effect of larval density on food utilization efficiency of T. molitor larvae was studied by measuring efficiency of ingested food conversion (ECI), efficiency of digested food conversion (EDC), and mg of larval weight gain per gram of food consumed (LWGpFC) at increasing larval densities (12, 24, 36, 48, 50, 62, 74, and 96 larvae per dm(2)) over four consecutive 3-wk periods. Individual larval weight gain and food consumption were negatively impacted by larval density. Similarly, ECI, ECD, and LWGpFC were negatively impacted by larval density. Larval ageing, measured as four consecutive 3-wk periods, significantly and independently impacted ECI, ECD, and LWGpFC in a negative way. General linear model analysis showed that age had a higher impact than density on food utilization parameters of T. molitor larvae. Larval growth was determined to be responsible for the age effects, as measurements of larval mass density (in grams of larvae per dm(2)) had a significant impact on food utilization parameters across ages and density treatments (in number of larvae per dm(2)). The importance of mass versus numbers per unit of area as measurements of larval density and the implications of negative effects of density on food utilization for insect biomass production are discussed.","['Animals', 'Biomass', 'Crowding', 'Feeding Behavior', 'Larva', 'Population Density', 'Tenebrio', 'Time Factors']",26453714,"[['B01.050'], ['G16.500.275.157.100', 'N06.230.124.100'], ['F01.145.875.281'], ['F01.145.113.547', 'F01.145.407', 'G07.203.650.353'], ['B05.500.500', 'G07.345.500.550.500.500'], ['N01.224.600', 'N06.850.505.400.600'], ['B01.050.500.131.617.720.500.500.375.615'], ['G01.910.857']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]']",0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
miR26a modulates Th17/T reg balance in the EAE model of multiple sclerosis by targeting IL6.,"A number of different microRNAs (miRNAs) have been implicated in various autoimmune diseases, including multiple sclerosis (MS). T helper (Th)17 and regulatory T cells (Tregs) have likewise been implicated as key players in MS, and a functional imbalance of these cell types is increasingly recognized as a key etiological factor in the disease. Although specific panels of transcription factors and cytokines are known to regulate the Th17/Treg balance, the role of noncoding RNAs remains poorly understood. The inflammatory cytokine, interleukin (IL)6, appears to play a critical role in both the development of the Th17 response and the inhibition of Treg functions. In this research, an IL6-associated miRNA, miR26a, was identified, and its normally downregulated expression was shown to be highly correlated with disease severity in patients suffering from MS as well as in C57BL/6 mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE; a well-established animal model of human MS). Using the EAE model system, in vivo silencing of miR26a was found to result in increased expression of Th17-related cytokines and increased severity of EAE, while overexpression of miR26a was found to result in reduced expression of Th17-related cytokines and a milder form of EAE. By contrast, Treg cell-specific transcription factor, Foxp3, was found to be positively correlated with miR26a expression. Finally, miR26a was found to downregulate Th17 and to upregulate Treg cell function through its targeting of IL6.

To date, the only detailed classifications of perianal Crohn's disease arise from referral center cohorts that do not reflect the spectrum of disease in the population as a whole.OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to document the rate, classification, and time course of symptomatic perianal Crohn's disease in a population-based cohort.DESIGN: This is a population-based cohort study.SETTING: : This study was conducted in the Canterbury region of New Zealand.PATIENTS: All patients with IBD in Canterbury, New Zealand, were eligible for recruitment over a 3-year period.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The clinical records of all patients with Crohn's disease were reviewed, and all symptomatic perianal disease was classified according to the American Gastroenterological Society position statement. The rate of perianal involvement and timing of onset relative to Crohn's diagnosis was determined.RESULTS: Ninety-one percent of IBD patients in the region were recruited. Seven hundred fifteen patients had Crohn's disease, of which 190 (26.6%) patients had symptomatic perianal disease. The median age of patients with perianal disease was 37 years (range, 4-82 years) and 58.4% were female. Median follow-up was 9 years (range, 2 months to 45 years) from Crohn's disease diagnosis. Onset of perianal disease ranged from 18 years pre-Crohn's diagnosis to 33 years post-Crohn's diagnosis. Fistulas were the most common lesion (50% of patients), followed by perianal abscesses (42.1%), fissures (32.6%), skin tags (11.1%), strictures (7.4%), and hemorrhoids (1.6%). The cumulative probability at 20 years of any perianal Crohn's disease was 42.7% and of a perianal fistula 28.3%.LIMITATIONS: This study assumed all noted perianal lesions were related to Crohn's disease and the retrospective classification may have been inaccurate in some cases.CONCLUSIONS: This study provides the first detailed classification of perianal Crohn's disease in a population-based cohort.","['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Anus Diseases', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'Crohn Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'New Zealand', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Time Factors', 'Young Adult']",22706129,"[['M01.060.057'], ['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['M01.060.116.100.080'], ['C06.405.469.860.101'], ['M01.060.406'], ['M01.060.406.448'], ['E05.318.372.500.750', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750'], ['C06.405.205.731.500', 'C06.405.469.432.500'], ['C23.550.291.656'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.249', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.350', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.350'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['Z01.639.760.747', 'Z01.678.100.747'], ['E05.318.372.500.500.500', 'E05.318.372.500.750.750', 'N05.715.360.330.500.500.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.825', 'N06.850.520.450.500.500.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.825'], ['G01.910.857'], ['M01.060.116.815']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1
Transfer of median and ulnar nerve fascicles for lesions of the posterior cord in infraclavicular brachial plexus injury: report of 2 cases.,"In infraclavicular lesions of brachial plexus, severe lesions of the posterior cord often occur when medial and lateral cord function is preserved to a greater or lesser extent. In these cases, shoulder function may be preserved by activity of the muscles innervated by the suprascapular nerve, but complete paralysis exists in the deltoid, triceps, and brachioradialis, and all wrist and finger extensors. Classical reconstruction procedures consist of nerve grafts, but their results in adults are disappointing. We report an approach transferring: (1) an ulnar nerve fascicle to the motor branch of the long portion of the triceps brachii muscle, (2) a median nerve branch from the pronator teres to the motor branch of the extensor carpi radialis longus, and (3) a median nerve branch from the flexor carpi radialis to the posterior interosseous nerve. We describe the procedure and report 2 clinical cases showing the effectiveness of this technique for restoring extension of the elbow, wrist, and fingers in the common infraclavicular lesions of the brachial plexus affecting the posterior cord.","['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Brachial Plexus', 'Humans', 'Hypesthesia', 'Male', 'Median Nerve', 'Muscle, Skeletal', 'Nerve Transfer', 'Paralysis', 'Ulnar Nerve']",23021172,"[['M01.060.057'], ['M01.060.116'], ['A08.800.800.720.050'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C10.597.751.791.500', 'C23.888.592.763.770.500'], ['A08.800.800.720.050.500'], ['A02.633.567', 'A10.690.552.500'], ['E04.525.550'], ['C10.597.622', 'C23.888.592.636'], ['A08.800.800.720.050.850']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
Competing formate- and carbon dioxide-utilizing prokaryotes in an anoxic methane-emitting fen soil.,"Methanogenesis in wetlands is dependent on intermediary substrates derived from the degradation of biopolymers. Formate is one such substrate and is stimulatory to methanogenesis and acetogenesis in anoxic microcosms of soil from the fen Schl?ppnerbrunnen. Formate dissimilation also yields CO(2) as a potential secondary substrate. The objective of this study was to resolve potential differences between anaerobic formate- and CO(2)-utilizing prokaryotes of this fen by stable isotope probing. Anoxic soil microcosms were pulsed daily with low concentrations of [(13)C]formate or (13)CO(2) (i.e., [(13)C]bicarbonate). Taxa were evaluated by assessment of 16S rRNA genes, mcrA (encoding the alpha-subunit of methyl-coenzyme M reductase), and fhs (encoding formyltetrahydrofolate synthetase). Methanogens, acetogens, and formate-hydrogen lyase-containing taxa appeared to compete for formate. Genes affiliated with Methanocellaceae, Methanobacteriaceae, Acetobacteraceae, and Rhodospirillaceae were (13)C enriched (i.e., labeled) in [(13)C]formate treatments, whereas genes affiliated with Methanosarcinaceae, Conexibacteraceae, and Solirubrobacteraceae were labeled in (13)CO(2) treatments. [(13)C]acetate was enriched in [(13)C]formate treatments, but labeling of known acetogenic taxa was not detected. However, several phylotypes were affiliated with acetogen-containing taxa (e.g., Sporomusa). Methanosaetaceae-affiliated methanogens appeared to participate in the consumption of acetate. Twelve and 58 family-level archaeal and bacterial 16S rRNA phylotypes, respectively, were detected, approximately half of which had no isolated representatives. Crenarchaeota constituted half of the detected archaeal 16S rRNA phylotypes. The results highlight the unresolved microbial diversity of the fen Schl?ppnerbrunnen, suggest that differing taxa competed for the same substrate, and indicate that Methanocellaceae, Methanobacteriaceae, Methanosarcinaceae, and Methanosaetaceae were linked to the production of methane, but they do not clearly resolve the taxa responsible for the apparent conversion of formate to acetate.","['Anaerobiosis', 'Biodiversity', 'Carbon Dioxide', 'Carbon Isotopes', 'Cluster Analysis', 'DNA, Archaeal', 'DNA, Bacterial', 'DNA, Ribosomal', 'Formates', 'Genes, rRNA', 'Methane', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Phylogeny', 'RNA, Archaeal', 'RNA, Bacterial', 'RNA, Ribosomal, 16S', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', 'Soil Microbiology', 'Wetlands']",21478308,"[['G02.111.062', 'G03.078'], ['G16.500.275.157.049', 'N06.230.124.049'], ['D01.200.200', 'D01.362.150', 'D01.650.550.200'], ['D01.268.150.075', 'D01.496.123'], ['E05.318.740.250', 'N05.715.360.750.200', 'N06.850.520.830.250'], ['D13.444.308.180'], ['D13.444.308.212'], ['D13.444.308.475'], ['D02.241.081.420'], ['G05.360.340.024.340.645.750'], ['D02.455.326.146.571'], ['L01.453.245.667'], ['G05.697', 'G16.075.605', 'L01.100.697'], ['D13.444.735.300'], ['D13.444.735.473'], ['D13.444.735.686.670'], ['E05.393.760.700'], ['G02.111.810.550', 'G05.810.550'], ['H01.158.273.540.274.555', 'N06.850.425.300'], ['G16.500.275.157.812', 'N06.230.124.625']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]']",0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0
Longitudinal follow-up of patients with Epstein-Barr virus-associated hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Although immunochemotherapy has been reported to be an effective initial treatment for patients with Epstein-Barr virus-associated hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (EBV-HLH), the long-term outcome of these patients remains unknown. The main purpose of this study was to determine the outcome of the EBV-HLH patients treated between 1992 and 2001.DESIGN AND METHODS: During this period, a total of 78 EBV-HLH patients were consecutively registered in 3 separate studies. The rates of initial response, reactivation, and survival as well as causes of death were analyzed. The outcome of the patients who received hematopoietic stem cell transplantation was also studied.RESULTS: With a median follow-up of 43 months, clinical reactivation was noted in 13 patients (19.4%) and a total of 12 patients needed hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, of whom 9 are alive and well. There had been 19 deaths: early deaths were due to hemorrhages and infections (n=11), while late deaths were related to late reactivation (n=4), transplant-associated causes (n=3) and secondary leukemia (n=1). Overall, after a median follow-up of 43 months, 59 (75.6%) of the 78 patients are alive and well.INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: The majority of successfully treated EBV-HLH patients have a good outcome and remain disease-free.","['Adolescent', 'Cause of Death', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cord Blood Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Dexamethasone', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Epstein-Barr Virus Infections', 'Etoposide', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human', 'Histiocytosis, Non-Langerhans-Cell', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulins, Intravenous', 'Immunotherapy', 'Infant', 'Japan', 'Male', 'Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective Studies', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Virus Activation']",15003893,"[['M01.060.057'], ['E05.318.308.985.550.250', 'N01.224.935.698.100', 'N06.850.505.400.975.550.250', 'N06.850.520.308.985.550.250'], ['M01.060.406'], ['M01.060.406.448'], ['E05.318.372.500.750', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750'], ['E02.186'], ['E02.095.147.500.500.312', 'E04.936.225.687.312'], ['D04.210.500.745.432.769.344', 'D04.210.500.908.238'], ['E02.319.310'], ['C01.925.256.466.313', 'C01.925.928.313'], ['D02.455.426.559.847.638.960.675.250', 'D04.615.638.960.675.250', 'D09.408.348.275'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.249', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.350', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.350'], ['B04.280.210.400.500.450', 'B04.280.382.400.500.400', 'B04.613.204.500.500.400'], ['C15.604.250.410'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D12.776.124.486.485.114.619.393.536', 'D12.776.124.486.485.114.632', 'D12.776.124.790.651.114.632', 'D12.776.377.715.548.114.632'], ['E02.095.465.425'], ['M01.060.703'], ['Z01.252.474.463', 'Z01.639.595'], ['E02.095.147.500.500.500.500', 'E04.936.225.687.500.500'], ['E01.789'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.625', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.650', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.650'], ['E02.860'], ['E05.318.740.998', 'N05.715.360.750.795', 'N06.850.520.830.998'], ['E01.789.800', 'N04.761.559.590.800', 'N05.715.360.575.575.800'], ['G06.920.925.940']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1
Ecotoxicological risk of pharmaceuticals from wastewater treatment plants in Korea: occurrence and toxicity to Daphnia magna.,"The overall ecotoxicological effect of pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) detected in the effluents of Korean wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) to Daphnia magna was investigated using biological and chemical analyses. The bioassay results showed median lethal concentrations and no-observed-effect concentrations ranging from a few to tens of ppm levels for nine PhACs in 48-h acute and 21-d chronic tests. The mixture effects of pharmaceuticals also were examined by other acute and chronic tests, which showed no significant toxicity despite a slightly increased combined effect of approximately twofold. The residual concentrations of nine PhACs were analyzed at concentrations ranging from 10 ng/L to 89 microg/L in the influents and from 10 ng/L to 11 microg/L in the effluents from four metropolitan cities in South Korea between January and November of 2004. Through repeated investigations of the influents and the effluents from different WWTPs, relatively higher removal efficiencies (23.9-91.3%) compared with those of previous surveys performed in other countries were observed for most pharmaceuticals, with the exception of acetaminophen (8.7%). The present study showed no significant risk effects of the effluents from WWTPs containing pharmaceuticals (i.e., hazard quotient < 1), even at the 95th percentile contamination range, although a risk assessment factor of 1,000 was applied. Therefore, it can be concluded that the potential risk of pharmaceuticals should be monitored carefully with more bioassay data, because many uncertainties still exist in the determination and toxicity of metabolites in water environments. No significant risk was observed, however, from the selected PhACs in the effluents from WWTPs discharged into surface waters.","['Animals', 'Daphnia', 'Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions', 'Environmental Monitoring', 'Korea', 'Lethal Dose 50', 'No-Observed-Adverse-Effect Level', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Reproduction', 'Risk Assessment', 'Sewage', 'Waste Disposal, Fluid', 'Water Pollutants, Chemical']",16494251,"[['B01.050'], ['B01.050.500.131.365.150.200'], ['C25.100'], ['N06.850.460.350.080', 'N06.850.780.375'], ['Z01.252.474.557', 'Z01.586.407'], ['E05.940.402', 'G07.225.500', 'G07.690.773.875.750', 'G07.690.936.500.750'], ['E05.940.600', 'G07.690.936.750'], ['D26'], ['G08.686.784'], ['E05.318.740.600.800.715', 'N04.452.871.715', 'N05.715.360.750.625.700.690', 'N06.850.505.715', 'N06.850.520.830.600.800.715'], ['D20.944.932.500'], ['N06.850.780.200.800.800.890', 'N06.850.860.510.900.600.900'], ['D27.888.284.903.655']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1
Vascularized fibular epiphyseal transfer for proximal humeral reconstruction in children with a primary sarcoma of bone.,"Aims: Preserving growth following limb-salvage surgery of the upper limb in children remains a challenge. Vascularized autografts may provide rapid biological incorporation with the potential for growth and longevity. In this study, we aimed to describe the outcomes following proximal humeral reconstruction with a vascularized fibular epiphyseal transfer in children with a primary sarcoma of bone. We also aimed to quantify the hypertrophy of the graft and the annual growth, and to determine the functional outcomes of the neoglenofibular joint.Patients and Methods: We retrospectively analyzed 11 patients who underwent this procedure for a primary bone tumour of the proximal humerus between 2004 and 2015. Six had Ewing's sarcoma and five had osteosarcoma. Their mean age at the time of surgery was five years (two to eight). The mean follow-up was 5.2 years (1 to 12.2).Results: The overall survival at five and ten years was 91% (confidence interval (CI) 95% 75% to 100%). At the time of the final review, ten patients were alive. One with local recurrence and metastasis died one-year post-operatively. Complications included seven fractures, four transient nerve palsies, and two patients developed avascular necrosis of the graft. All the fractures presented within the first postoperative year and united with conservative management. One patient had two further operations for a slipped fibular epiphysis of the autograft, and a hemi-epiphysiodesis for lateral tibial physeal arrest. Hypertrophy and axial growth were evident in nine patients who did not have avascular necrosis of the graft. The mean hypertrophy index was 65% (55% to 82%), and the mean growth was 4.6 mm per annum (2.4 to 7.6) in these nine grafts. At final follow-up, the mean modified functional Musculoskeletal Tumour Society score was 77% (63% to 83%) and the mean Toronto Extremity Salvage Score (TESS) was 84% (65% to 94%).Conclusion: Vascularized fibular epiphyseal transfer preserves function and growth in young children following excision of the proximal humerus for a malignant bone tumour. Function compares favourably to other limb-salvage procedures in children. Longer term analysis is required to determine if this technique proves to be durable into adulthood.

"Vasorelaxant effects of Cerebralcare Granule® are mediated by NO/cGMP pathway, potassium channel opening and calcium channel blockade in isolated rat thoracic aorta.","ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Cerebralcare Granule (CG), one of the famous classical recipes in traditional Chinese medicine, is developed from the ""Decoction of Four Drugs"". It has been used for treatment of cerebrovascular related diseases, such as hypertension. It is well known that vasodilatation plays a very important role in hypertensive. Despite the popular medicinal use of CG, little data was available to its activity and mechanism involved in vasodilatation. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the vasorelaxant effects of CG on isolated rat thoracic aorta so as to assess some of the possible mechanisms. The present study was performed to examine the vasodilative activity of CG and its mechanisms in isolated rat thoracic aorta.MATERIALS AND METHODS: CG was studied on isolated rat thoracic aorta in vitro, including endothelium-intact and endothelium-denuded aortic rings. In present study, specific inhibitors including NO synthase inhibitor NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME), cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitor indomethacin (INDO), non-selective K+ channel inhibitor tetraethylammonium chloride (TEA), Kir channel inhibitor BaCl2, KATP channel inhibitor Glibenclamide (Gli) and cholinergic receptor antagonist atropine were used, they were added 20 min before NE contraction and then added CG-induced vasodilation.RESULTS: Removal of endothelium or pretreatment of aortic rings (intact endothelium) with L-NAME (0.1 mM) or INDO (0.01 mM) significantly blocked the CG induced relaxation. Pretreatment with the non-selective K+ channel inhibitor TEA (1 mM), or the Kir channel inhibitor BaCl2 (0.1 mM), neither of them had no influence on the CG-induced response (p>0.05). However, pretreatment with the KATP channel inhibitor Gli (0.01 mM) produced significant inhibition on the CG-induced response (p<0.01). Besides, CG also inhibited the contraction triggered by NE in endothelium-denuded rings in Ca2+-free medium. CG (0.4, 0.8 and 3.2 mg/mL) produced rightward parallel displacement of CaCl2 curves and reduced the maximum contraction induced by 30 mM CaCl2 to 31.1±9.3%, 18.8±6.9% and 9.4±4.5%, respectively. The relaxation, induced by CG on endothelium-intact rat aortic rings pre-contracted with NE, was significantly attenuated in the presence of atropine (EC50=3.7 mg/mL, p<0.01).CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that CG induces relaxation in rat aortic rings through an endothelium-dependent pathway mediated by NO/cGMP pathway and an endothelium-independent pathway involving blockade of Ca2+ channels, inhibition of Ca2+ mobilization from intracellular stores, opening of KATP channel. In addition, the muscarinic receptor stimulation is also one of the vasorelaxant mechanisms.","['Animals', 'Aorta, Thoracic', 'Calcium', 'Calcium Channel Blockers', 'Calcium Channels', 'Cyclic GMP', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drugs, Chinese Herbal', 'Endothelium, Vascular', 'KATP Channels', 'Male', 'Nitric Oxide', 'Potassium Channels', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar', 'Vasodilation', 'Vasodilator Agents']",24924524,"[['B01.050'], ['A07.015.114.056.372'], ['D01.268.552.100', 'D01.552.539.288', 'D23.119.100'], ['D27.505.519.562.249', 'D27.505.696.260.500', 'D27.505.954.411.192'], ['D12.776.157.530.400.150', 'D12.776.543.550.450.150', 'D12.776.543.585.400.150'], ['D03.633.100.759.646.454.160', 'D13.695.462.275', 'D13.695.667.454.160', 'D13.695.827.426.160'], ['G07.690.773.875', 'G07.690.936.500'], ['D20.215.784.500.350', 'D26.335'], ['A07.015.700.500', 'A10.272.491.355'], ['D12.776.157.530.400.600.450.550', 'D12.776.543.550.450.750.450.550', 'D12.776.543.585.400.750.450.550'], ['D01.339.387', 'D01.625.550.500', 'D01.625.700.500', 'D01.650.550.587.600'], ['D12.776.157.530.400.600', 'D12.776.543.550.450.750', 'D12.776.543.585.400.750'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700.900'], ['G09.330.380.928'], ['D27.505.954.411.918']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Clinical inconsistency, benign course and normal employment rates in unselected systemic lupus erythematosus.","Of 65 unselected SLE patients from a defined population, 61 were sequentially followed for two years with an SLE supervision programme. The cumulative clinical manifestations included a relatively high frequency of pulmonary vascular disease and gastrointestinal involvement. Flares were more common during the summer season and a change in the clinical manifestations occurred in 10 of 16 patients with major flares and in 4 of 13 patients with minor flares. ESR, S-orosomucoid, S-CRP, and C1r-C1s-C1 IA complexes, indicating C1 activation, were shown to distinguish inactive from active disease. The prevailing overall benignancy was reflected in a low mortality rate, limited need for treatment or hospitalisation, and good response to moderate dosages of corticosteroids in severe flares. The proportion of patients in gainful employment was comparable to that in the normal population, though absence due to sickness was more common in the SLE group. Joint complaints and mild psychiatric disturbance were the most common causes of enduring incapacity.","['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antibodies, Antinuclear', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Complement System Proteins', 'Employment', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lupus Erythematosus, Systemic', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pregnancy', 'Work Capacity Evaluation']",3878760,"[['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['D12.776.124.486.485.114.323.204', 'D12.776.124.790.651.114.323.204', 'D12.776.377.715.548.114.323.204'], ['C01.150.252'], ['D12.776.124.486.274'], ['N01.824.245'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C17.300.480', 'C20.111.590'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['G08.686.784.769'], ['E01.370.400.925']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
Impaired down-regulation of negative emotion in self-referent social situations in bipolar disorder: A pilot study of a novel experimental paradigm.,"Emotion dysregulation is a core feature of bipolar disorder (BD) that persists into periods of remission. Neuroimaging studies show aberrant neural responses during emotion regulation (ER) in patients with BD relative to healthy controls, but behavioural evidence for ER deficits is sparse and conflicting. This study aimed to explore ER in BD using a novel, personally relevant experimental paradigm. Twenty patients with BD and 20 patients with unipolar disorder (UD), in full or partial remission, and 20 healthy controls were given a novel computerised test. Participants were instructed to react naturally or dampen their emotional response to positive and negative social scenarios and associated self-beliefs. They were also given an established experimental task for comparison, involving reappraisal of negative affective picture stimuli, as well as a questionnaire of habitual ER strategies. BD patients showed reduced ability to down-regulate emotional responses in negative, but not positive, social scenarios relative to healthy controls and UD patients. In contrast, there were no between-group differences in the established ER task or in self-reported habitual reappraisal strategies. Findings highlight the novel social scenario paradigm as a sensitive test for detection of ER difficulties in BD.","['Adult', 'Affective Symptoms', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Down-Regulation', 'Emotions', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pilot Projects']",27086251,"[['M01.060.116'], ['F01.145.126.100'], ['F03.084.500'], ['E05.318.372.500.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.500'], ['G02.111.240', 'G05.308.200', 'G07.690.773.937'], ['F01.470'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['E05.318.372.750', 'E05.337.737', 'N05.715.360.330.720', 'N06.850.520.450.720']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]']",0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
Eosinophilic pustular folliculitis. Studies on possible chemotactic factors involved in the formation of pustules.,"Eosinophilic pustular folliculitis (EPF) is a dermatosis of unknown aetiology, characterized by repeated development of pruritic follicular papulopustules with a tendency to form an annular configuration on the face and other seborrhoeic areas, and by palmoplantar pustular lesions in one-fifth of the patients. Both types of lesions are infiltrated mainly by eosinophils with some polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN). To elucidate the mechanisms underlying pustule formation, we studied the chemotactic activity for leukocytes of the skin surface lipids (SSL) obtained from seborrhoeic areas. No specific chemotactic activity was detectable in stored SSL from patients with EPF. However, fresh SSL collected from the seborrhoeic areas of normal adults contained chemotactic substances for eosinophils and PMN which were labile on storage in air. In stratum corneum extracts from palmoplantar lesions of patients with EPF we demonstrated the presence of a 13000 molecular weight chemoattractant factor for PMN, the activity of which was partially inhibited by antiserum against C5a, and a low molecular weight lipid-soluble chemotactic factor for eosinophils, the activity of which was also lost on storage in air. Our findings suggest that these chemotactic factors play a role in the production of the characteristic pustular lesions of EPF.","['Adult', 'Chemotactic Factors', 'Chemotactic Factors, Eosinophil', 'Chemotaxis, Leukocyte', 'Eosinophilia', 'Female', 'Folliculitis', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Neutrophils', 'Skin', 'Skin Diseases, Vesiculobullous']",3511943,"[['M01.060.116'], ['D23.125'], ['D23.125.320'], ['G04.198.424.233'], ['C15.378.553.231'], ['C17.800.329.500'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['A11.118.637.415.583', 'A11.627.340.583', 'A11.733.689', 'A15.145.229.637.415.583', 'A15.382.490.315.583', 'A15.382.680.689'], ['A17.815'], ['C17.800.865']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
Reprogramming of somatic cells: iPS and iN cells.,"Limited access to human neurons has posed a significant barrier to progress in biological and preclinical studies of the human nervous system. The advent of cell reprogramming technologies has widely disclosed unprecedented opportunities to generate renewable sources of human neural cells for disease modeling, drug discovery, and cell therapeutics. Both somatic reprogramming into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and directly induced Neurons (iNeurons) rely on transcription factor-based cellular conversion processes. Nevertheless, they rely on very distinct mechanisms, biological barriers, technical limitations, different levels of efficiency, and generate neural cells with distinctive properties. Human iPSCs represent a long-term renewable source of neural cells, but over time genomic aberrations might erode the quality of the cultures and the in vitro differentiation process requires extensive time. Conversely, direct neuronal reprogramming ensures a fast and straightforward generation of iNeurons endowed with functional properties. However, in this last case, conversion efficiency is reduced when starting from adult human cells, and the molecular and functional fidelity of iNeurons with respect to their corresponding native neuronal subtype is yet to be fully ascertained in many cases. For any biomedical research application, it should be carefully pondered the reprogramming method to use for generating reprogrammed human neuronal subtypes that best fit with the following analysis considering the existing limitations and gap of knowledge still present in this young field of investigation.","['Cell Differentiation', 'Cellular Reprogramming', 'Humans', 'Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells', 'Neurons', 'Transcription Factors']",28552235,"[['G04.152'], ['G04.152.262', 'G05.135'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['A11.872.040.500', 'A11.872.700.500'], ['A08.675', 'A11.671'], ['D12.776.930']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]']",1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
NK1R/5-HT1AR interaction is related to the regulation of melanogenesis.,"Substance P (SP) is a candidate mediator along the brain-skin axis and can mimic the effects of stress to regulate melanogenesis. Previously, we and others have found that the regulation of SP for pigmentary function was mediated by neurokinin 1 receptor (NK1R). Emerging evidence has accumulated that psychologic stress can induce dysfunction in the cutaneous serotonin 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)-5-HT1A/1B receptor system, thereby resulting in skin hypopigmentation. Moreover, NK1R and 5-HTR (except 5-HT3) belong to GPCR. The present study aimed at assessing the possible existence of NK1R-5-HTR interactions and related melanogenic functions. Western blot and PCR detection revealed that SP reduced expression of 5-HT1A receptor via the NK1 receptor. Biochemical analyses showed that NK1R and 5-HT1AR could colocalize and interact in a cell and in the skin. When the N terminus of the NK1R protein was removed NK1R surface targeting was prevented, the interaction between NK1R-5-HT1AR decreased, and the depigmentation caused by SP and WAY100635 could be rescued. Importantly, pharmaceutical coadministration of NK1R agonist (SP) and 5-HT1A antagonist (WAY100635) enhanced the NK1-5-HT1A receptor coimmunoprecipitation along with the depigmentary response. SP and WAY100635 cooperation elicited activation of a signaling cascade (the extracellular, regulated protein kinase p-JNK signaling pathway) and inhibition of p70S6K1 phosphorylation and greatly reduced melanin production in vitro and in vivo in mice and zebrafish. Moreover, the SP-induced depigmentation response did not be occur in 5-htr1aa+/- zebrafish embryos.

Intraclonal protein expression heterogeneity in recombinant CHO cells.,"Therapeutic glycoproteins have played a major role in the commercial success of biotechnology in the post-genomic era. But isolating recombinant mammalian cell lines for large-scale production remains costly and time-consuming, due to substantial variation and unpredictable stability of expression amongst transfected cells, requiring extensive clone screening to identify suitable high producers. Streamlining this process is of considerable interest to industry yet the underlying phenomena are still not well understood. Here we examine an antibody-expressing Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) clone at single-cell resolution using flow cytometry and vectors, which couple light and heavy chain transcription to fluorescent markers. Expression variation has traditionally been attributed to genetic heterogeneity arising from random genomic integration of vector DNA. It follows that single cell cloning should yield a homogeneous cell population. We show, in fact, that expression in a clone can be surprisingly heterogeneous (standard deviation 50 to 70% of the mean), approaching the level of variation in mixed transfectant pools, and each antibody chain varies in tandem. Phenotypic variation is fully developed within just 18 days of cloning, yet is not entirely explained by measurement noise, cell size, or the cell cycle. By monitoring the dynamic response of subpopulations and subclones, we show that cells also undergo slow stochastic fluctuations in expression (half-life 2 to 11 generations). Non-genetic diversity may therefore play a greater role in clonal variation than previously thought. This also has unexpected implications for expression stability. Stochastic gene expression noise and selection bias lead to perturbations from steady state at the time of cloning. The resulting transient response as clones reestablish their expression distribution is not ordinarily accounted for but can contribute to declines in median expression over timescales of up to 50 days. Noise minimization may therefore be a novel strategy to reduce apparent expression instability and simplify cell line selection.","['Animals', 'CHO Cells', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Shape', 'Cell Size', 'Clone Cells', 'Cricetinae', 'Cricetulus', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescence', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin G', 'Recombination, Genetic']",20037651,"[['B01.050'], ['A11.251.210.200', 'A11.436.155'], ['G04.144'], ['G04.320'], ['G04.325'], ['A11.251.353'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.075.250'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.075.250.250'], ['E01.370.225.500.363.342', 'E01.370.225.500.386.350', 'E05.196.712.516.600.240.350', 'E05.200.500.363.342', 'E05.200.500.386.350', 'E05.242.363.342', 'E05.242.386.350'], ['G01.358.500.505.650.665.500', 'G01.590.540.665.500'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D12.776.124.486.485.114.619.393', 'D12.776.124.790.651.114.619.393', 'D12.776.377.715.548.114.619.393'], ['G05.728']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Bacterial and protozoal pathogens found in ticks collected from humans in Corum province of Turkey.,"BACKGROUND: Tick-borne diseases are increasing all over the word, including Turkey. The aim of this study was to determine the bacterial and protozoan vector-borne pathogens in ticks infesting humans in the Corum province of Turkey.METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: From March to November 2014 a total of 322 ticks were collected from patients who attended the local hospitals with tick bites. Ticks were screened by real time-PCR and PCR, and obtained amplicons were sequenced. The dedected tick was belonging to the genus Hyalomma, Haemaphysalis, Rhipicephalus, Dermacentor and Ixodes. A total of 17 microorganism species were identified in ticks. The most prevalent Rickettsia spp. were: R. aeschlimannii (19.5%), R. slovaca (4.5%), R. raoultii (2.2%), R. hoogstraalii (1.9%), R. sibirica subsp. mongolitimonae (1.2%), R. monacensis (0.31%), and Rickettsia spp. (1.2%). In addition, the following pathogens were identified: Borrelia afzelii (0.31%), Anaplasma spp. (0.31%), Ehrlichia spp. (0.93%), Babesia microti (0.93%), Babesia ovis (0.31%), Babesia occultans (3.4%), Theileria spp. (1.6%), Hepatozoon felis (0.31%), Hepatozoon canis (0.31%), and Hemolivia mauritanica (2.1%). All samples were negative for Francisella tularensis, Coxiella burnetii, Bartonella spp., Toxoplasma gondii and Leishmania spp.CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Ticks in Corum carry a large variety of human and zoonotic pathogens that were detected not only in known vectors, but showed a wider vector diversity. There is an increase in the prevalence of ticks infected with the spotted fever group and lymphangitis-associated rickettsiosis, while Ehrlichia spp. and Anaplasma spp. were reported for the first time from this region. B. microti was detected for the first time in Hyalomma marginatum infesting humans. The detection of B. occultans, B. ovis, Hepatozoon spp., Theileria spp. and Hemolivia mauritanica indicate the importance of these ticks as vectors of pathogens of veterinary importance, therefore patients with a tick infestation should be followed for a variety of pathogens with medical importance.","['Anaplasma', 'Animals', 'Arachnid Vectors', 'Babesia', 'Bartonella', 'Ehrlichia', 'Humans', 'Ixodidae', 'Rickettsia', 'Tick-Borne Diseases', 'Turkey']",29649265,"[['B03.440.664.750.050', 'B03.660.050.783.500.050'], ['B01.050'], ['N06.850.335.188.100.100', 'N06.850.520.203.375.100.100'], ['B01.043.075.600.580.070'], ['B03.440.090.100', 'B03.660.050.030.040'], ['B03.440.664.750.287', 'B03.660.050.783.500.287'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['B01.050.500.131.166.132.832.400'], ['B03.660.050.783.875.650.650'], ['C01.920.930'], ['Z01.252.245.500.850']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Geographicals [Z]']",0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1
Effects of ethanol on muscarinic receptor-stimulated phosphoinositide metabolism during brain development.,"The pattern of muscarinic receptor-stimulated inositol metabolism during postnatal development has a striking resemblance with the curve of rat brain growth spurt. Therefore, the enhanced hydrolysis of membrane inositol lipids by cholinergic agonists during this period may have a relevant role in cell proliferation and differentiation. In this study we have investigated whether exposure to EtOH to rat pups during the brain growth spurt, known to cause a permanent microencephaly, would alter muscarinic receptor-stimulated inositol metabolism in cerebral cortex. Female Long-Evans rats were administered 4 g/kg of EtOH, in two doses of 2 g/kg, by gastric intubation from postnatal day 4 to day 10. This treatment did not have any effect on the pups' body weight as compared to an equally handled, sucrose-fed group of animals. Blood EtOH concentration in the pups during exposure ranged between 237 and 283 mg/dl. Muscarinic receptor-stimulated inositol metabolism was measured in cerebral cortex slices of control and EtOH-treated rats at days 4, 7, 10, 12, 20 and 45 of age. Carbachol-induced accumulation of [3H] inositol phosphates was reduced significantly in EtOH-exposed animals on day 7 and 10, but not at other ages. This decrease was not due to an alteration of muscarinic receptor density or affinity. Exposure to EtOH had no effect on phosphoinositide metabolism stimulated by norepinephrine, serotonin or histamine in cerebral cortex, whereas the effect of glutamate was increased. Similar results were observed in the hippocampus. An identical treatment with EtOH in adult rats did not cause alteration in any of the biochemical parameters of the cholinergic system measured.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'Brain', 'Carbachol', 'Ethanol', 'Female', 'Phosphatidylinositols', 'Pregnancy', 'Quinuclidinyl Benzilate', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Muscarinic']",2547937,"[['B01.050'], ['B01.050.050.282'], ['A08.186.211'], ['D02.092.877.883.333.115', 'D02.675.276.232.115'], ['D02.033.375'], ['D10.570.755.375.760.400.942'], ['G08.686.784.769'], ['D02.241.223.601.238.306.740', 'D02.241.511.085.740', 'D03.605.687.800'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700'], ['D12.776.543.750.695.475', 'D12.776.543.750.720.360.500']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Autologous Induced Stem-Cell-Derived Retinal Cells for Macular Degeneration.,"We assessed the feasibility of transplanting a sheet of retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells differentiated from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) in a patient with neovascular age-related macular degeneration. The iPSCs were generated from skin fibroblasts obtained from two patients with advanced neovascular age-related macular degeneration and were differentiated into RPE cells. The RPE cells and the iPSCs from which they were derived were subject to extensive testing. A surgery that included the removal of the neovascular membrane and transplantation of the autologous iPSC-derived RPE cell sheet under the retina was performed in one of the patients. At 1 year after surgery, the transplanted sheet remained intact, best corrected visual acuity had not improved or worsened, and cystoid macular edema was present.

[Study and preparation of a novel apatite-wollastonite bioactive glass-ceramic-calcium sulphate hemihydrate composite].,"OBJECTIVE: To prepare a novel apatite-wollastonite bioactive glass-ceramic-calcium sulphate hemihydrate(AW-BGC-CSH) composite, to study its biocompatibility, and to provide experimental support for its further clinical application.METHODS: Samples of AW-BGC-CSH composite were prepared with different AW-BGC granules-CSH ratios (50%, 40%, 30%, 20%). Surface morphology, microstructure and mechanical features of the composite were measured. Osteoblasts were cultivated in vitro on the composite. Cell morphology, proliferation, and the alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity of osteoblasts were examined to determine the biocompatibility of the composite.RESULTS: The composite showed a three-dimensional pored structure with communicated micropores under scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The plasticity of the composite could be maintained within 3 - 5 min. Its top solidification temperature was 36.4°C and the maximum compressive strength was 9.3 MPa. The osteoblasts adhered to the composite and grew well. At 1, 3, 5, 7 d after cultivated, the microprotein contents of the composite were (251 ± 12), (296 ± 31), (580 ± 13) and (571 ± 15) mg/L, and the ALP activity of the composite were (4.50 ± 0.68), (6.90 ± 0.27), (12.05 ± 0.28) and (11.86 ± 0.63) U/mg. The results of the ALP activity and microprotein contents in the experiment group were significantly higher than those in the control group (P < 0.05).CONCLUSIONS: The prepared AW-BGC-CSH composite has a three-dimensional pored structure, favourable plasticity, mechanical property and good biocompatibility.","['Apatites', 'Biocompatible Materials', 'Calcium Compounds', 'Calcium Sulfate', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Ceramics', 'Materials Testing', 'Osteoblasts', 'Silicates']",21122439,"[['D01.029.260.700.675.374.075.025', 'D01.146.360.050', 'D01.578.122', 'D01.695.625.675.650.075.025'], ['D25.130', 'D27.720.102.130', 'J01.637.051.130'], ['D01.146'], ['D01.146.375', 'D01.578.215', 'D01.875.800.800.850.125'], ['A11.251'], ['J01.637.153'], ['E05.570'], ['A11.329.629'], ['D01.578.725', 'D01.837.725.700.760']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
[SELECTIVE EFFICACY OF GEORGIAN LEGUME EXTRACTS ON JURKAT AND MDCK CELLS].,"The goal of our study was to establish the anti- proapoptotic activity of the common in Georgia crops on the Jurkat and MDCK cells. Extracts of various varieties of beans (Tirkmela, Batumi meadow, Shulavera, Udelebi, as well as green peas, Lens Culinaris lentils, soy beans) were added to the intact or incubated under oxidative stress conditions Jurkat and MDCK cells. Cell viability (apoptosis intensity) was determined by a cell proliferative activity test (MTT test). Correlation and statistical analysis of ANOVA was performed using the package (SPSS version 11.0). In the presented study the selective effectiveness of extracts with different antioxidant activity on intact and incubated under oxidative stress Jurkat and MDCK cells was revealed, related with different sensitivity of cells to the oxidative stress. In normal MDCK epithelial cells, resistant to redox-active factors (H2O2), inverse relationship between the intensity of apoptosis and the antiradical potential of the extract was found; in leukemia transformated Jurkat cells, characterized by high sensitivity to oxidants (H2O2), a violation of the redox-dependent anti-apoptotic cell protection mechanisms was revealed, which is manifested by the absence of regularity of the cytoprotective / cytotoxic effects of the extracts on intact and incubated cells under oxidative stress conditions. These results can be used in the development of schemes of anti-tumor and anti-inflammatory therapy.","['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Dogs', 'Fabaceae', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Madin Darby Canine Kidney Cells', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Plant Extracts']",31101797,"[['B01.050'], ['G04.146.954.035'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.750.250.216.200'], ['B01.650.940.800.575.912.250.401'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D01.248.497.158.685.750.424', 'D01.339.431.374.424', 'D01.650.550.750.400', 'D02.389.338.253'], ['A11.251.210.190.495', 'A11.251.860.180.495', 'A15.382.490.555.567.569.440'], ['A11.251.210.827', 'A11.436.589'], ['G03.673', 'G07.775.750'], ['D20.215.784.500', 'D26.667']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
The human transforming growth factor alpha promoter directs transcription initiation from a single site in the absence of a TATA sequence.,"Transforming growth factor alpha (TGF-alpha) is a transformation-responsive mitogenic polypeptide that is expressed in the brain, epithelial cells, and activated macrophages. We isolated and characterized the TGF-alpha promoter and localized the 5' end of the TGF-alpha transcript to a unique position. Surprisingly, no apparent TATA box was present in the promoter sequence, suggesting that transcription from mammalian genes can initiate at unique and specific positions from promoters lacking this sequence motif.","['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Chimera', 'Genes', 'Genes, Homeobox', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Plasmids', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'RNA, Messenger', 'Restriction Mapping', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transforming Growth Factors']",2907605,"[['G02.111.570.060', 'L01.453.245.667.060'], ['G02.111.570.080', 'G05.360.080', 'L01.453.245.667.080'], ['B05.200'], ['G05.360.340.024.340'], ['G05.360.340.024.340.230.500'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['L01.453.245.667'], ['G05.360.600'], ['G02.111.570.080.689.675', 'G05.360.080.689.675', 'G05.360.340.024.340.137.750.680'], ['D13.444.735.544'], ['E05.393.183.620.650', 'E05.393.712'], ['G02.111.873', 'G05.297.700'], ['D12.644.276.963', 'D12.776.467.960', 'D23.529.960']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
Resident Participation is Not Associated With Worse Outcomes After TKA.,"BACKGROUND: Approximately one-half of all US surgical procedures, and one-third of orthopaedic procedures, are performed at teaching hospitals. However, the effect of resident participation and their level of training on patient care for TKA postoperative physical function, operative time, length of stay, and facility discharge are unclear.QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: (1) Are resident participation, postgraduate year (PGY) training level, and number of residents associated with absolute postoperative Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS®-10) global physical function score (PCS), and achieving minimum clinically important difference (MCID) PCS improvement, after TKA? (2) Are resident participation, PGY, and number of residents associated with increased TKA operative time? (3) Are resident participation, PGY, and number of residents associated with increased length of stay after TKA? (4) Are resident participation, PGY, and number of residents associated with higher odds of patients being discharged to another inpatient facility, rather than to their home (facility discharge)?METHODS: We performed a retrospective study using a longitudinally maintained institutional registry of TKAs that included 1626 patients at a single tertiary academic institution from April 2011 through July 2016. All patients who underwent primary, elective unilateral TKA were included with no exclusions. All patients were included in the operative time, length of stay, and facility discharge models. The PCS model required postoperative PCS score (n = 1417; 87%; mean, 46.4; SD, 8.5) and the MCID PCS model required pre- and postoperative PCS (n = 1333; 82%; 55% achieved MCID). Resident participation was defined as named residents being present in the operating room and documented in the operative notes, and resident PGY level was determined by the date of TKA and its duration since the resident entered the program and using the standard resident academic calendar (July - June). Multivariable regression was used to assess PCS scores, operative time, length of stay, and facility discharge in patients whose surgery was performed with and without intraoperative resident participation, accounting for PGY training level and number of residents. We defined the MCID PCS score improvement as 5 points on a 100-point scale. Adjusting variables included surgeon, academic year, age, sex, race-ethnicity, Charlson Comorbidity Index, preoperative PCS, and patient-reported mental function, BMI, tobacco use, alcohol use, and postoperative PCS time for the PCS models. We had postoperative PCS for 1417 (87%) surgeries.RESULTS: Compared with attending-only TKAs (5% of procedures), no postgraduate year or number of residents was associated with either postoperative PCS or MCID PCS improvement (PCS: PGY-1 = -0.98, 95% CI, -6.14 to 4.17, p = 0.708; PGY-2 = -0.26, 95% CI, -2.01to 1.49, p = 0.768; PGY-3 = -0.32, 95% CI, -2.16 to 1.51, p = 0.730; PGY-4 = -0.28, 95% CI, -1.99 to 1.43, p = 0.746; PGY-5 = -0.47, 95% CI, -2.13 to 1.18, p = 0.575; two residents = 0.28, 95% CI, -1.05 to 1.62, p = 0.677) (MCID PCS: PGY-1 = odds ratio [OR], 0.30, 95% CI, 0.07-1.30, p = 0.108; PGY-2 = OR, 0.86, 95% CI, 0.46-1.62, p = 0.641; PGY-3 = OR, 0.97, 95% CI, 0.49-1.89, p = 0.921; PGY-4 = OR, 0.73, 95% CI, 0.39-1.36, p = 0.325; PGY-5 = OR, 0.71, 95% CI, 0.39-1.29, p = 0.259; two residents = OR, 1.23, 95% CI, 0.80-1.89, p = 0.337). Longer operative times were associated with all PGY levels except for PGY-5 (attending surgeon only [reference] = 85.60 minutes, SD, 14.5 minutes; PGY-1 = 100. 13 minutes, SD, 21.22 minutes, +8.44 minutes, p = 0.015; PGY-2 = 103.40 minutes, SD, 23.01 minutes, +11.63 minutes, p < 0.001; PGY-3 = 97.82 minutes, SD, 18.24 minutes, +9.68 minutes, p < 0.001; PGY-4 = 96.39 minutes, SD, 18.94 minutes, +4.19 minutes, p = 0.011; PGY-5 = 88.91 minutes, SD, 19.81 minutes, -0.29 minutes, p = 0.853) or the presence of multiple residents (+4.39 minutes, p = 0.024). There were no associations with length of stay (PGY-1 = +0.04 days, 95% CI, -0.63 to 0.71 days, p = 0.912; PGY-2 = -0.08 days, 95% CI, -0.48 to 0.33 days, p = 0.711; PGY-3 = -0.29 days, 95% CI, -0.66 to 0.09 days, p = 0.131; PGY-4 = -0.30 days, 95% CI, -0.69 to 0.08 days, p = 0.120; PGY-5 = -0.28 days, 95% CI, -0.66 to 0.10 days, p = 0.145; two residents = -0.12 days, 95% CI, -0.29 to 0.06 days, p = 0.196) or facility discharge (PGY-1 = OR, 1.03, 95% CI, 0.26-4.08, p = 0.970; PGY-2 = OR, 0.61, 95% CI, 0.31-1.20, p = 0.154; PGY-3 = OR, 0.98, 95% CI, 0.48-2.02, p = 0.964; PGY-4 = OR, 0.83, 95% CI, 0.43-1.57, p = 0.599; PGY-5 = OR, 0.7, 95% CI, 0.41-1.40, p = 0.372; two residents = OR, 0.93, 95% CI, 0.56-1.54, p = 0.766) for any PGY or number of residents.CONCLUSIONS: Our findings should help assure patients, residents, physicians, insurers, and hospital administrators that resident participation, after adjusting for numerous patient and clinical factors, does not have any association with key medical and financial metrics, including postoperative PCS, MCID PCS, length of stay, and facility discharge. Future research in this field should focus on whether residents affect knee-specific patient-reported outcomes such as the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Score and additional orthopaedic procedures, and determine how resident medical education can be further enhanced without compromising patient care and safety.Level of Evidence Level III, therapeutic study.","['Adult', 'Aged', 'Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee', 'Clinical Competence', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Internship and Residency', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Minimal Clinically Important Difference', 'Orthopedic Surgeons', 'Physical Functional Performance', 'Postoperative Period', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Treatment Outcome']",29480888,"[['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['E04.555.110.110.115', 'E04.650.110.115', 'E04.680.101.110.115'], ['I02.399.630.210', 'N04.761.210', 'N05.715.175'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['I02.358.337.350.500', 'I02.358.399.350.750'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['N04.761.559.590.399.750', 'N05.715.360.575.575.399.750'], ['M01.526.485.810.910.875', 'N02.360.810.910.875'], ['N01.400.545.750'], ['E04.614.750', 'N02.421.585.753.750'], ['E05.318.372.500.500.500', 'E05.318.372.500.750.750', 'N05.715.360.330.500.500.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.825', 'N06.850.520.450.500.500.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.825'], ['E01.789.800', 'N04.761.559.590.800', 'N05.715.360.575.575.800']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]']",0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0
Automated nucleic acid isolation in viral molecular diagnostics: evaluation of the QIAsymphony SP.,"The Qiagen QIAsymphony SP is a high-throughput (up to 96 samples per run), fully-automated nucleic acid isolation system. It was implemented in the authors' laboratory to cope with the high demand for pandemic H1N1 influenza testing in 2009. This study evaluated the QIAsymphony SP for viral nucleic acid isolation from quality control materials, pure cultures and various clinical specimens. The effect of varying sample volume on detection sensitivity was investigated using serial 10-fold dilutions of pure viral specimens and target nucleic acids were detected by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays. Little variability in detection sensitivity was observed for all the viral targets tested, although variation in cycle threshold values was apparent in some cases. Importantly, pathogens were detectable over a broad concentration range and from diverse clinical specimens. Removal of PCR inhibitors was generally effective, as demonstrated by detection of viral nucleic acids and/or internal controls. The results demonstrate that the QIAsymphony SP is suitable for use in routine virology molecular diagnostics, and provides a high-throughput capacity, which is needed in peak seasons of infection or in centralised laboratories.","['Animals', 'Automation, Laboratory', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chick Embryo', 'DNA, Viral', 'Dogs', 'Humans', 'Influenza A Virus, H1N1 Subtype', 'Nucleic Acids', 'Pathology, Molecular', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Quality Control', 'RNA, Viral', 'Reagent Kits, Diagnostic', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction']",22558800,"[['B01.050'], ['E05.064', 'J01.897.104.416'], ['A11.251'], ['A13.350.150', 'A16.331.200'], ['D13.444.308.568'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.750.250.216.200'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['B04.820.480.968.405.400.214'], ['D13.444'], ['H01.158.201.636.475.750', 'H01.158.273.343.595.475.750', 'H01.181.122.650.475.680', 'H02.403.650.505'], ['E05.393.620.500'], ['J01.897.608'], ['D13.444.735.828'], ['D27.505.259.875', 'D27.720.470.410.680', 'E07.720'], ['E05.393.620.500.706']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0
"Comparison of hospital databases on antibiotic consumption in France, for a single management tool.","CONTEXT: The surveillance of antibiotic use in hospitals and of data on resistance is an essential measure for antibiotic stewardship. There are 3 national systems in France to collect data on antibiotic use: DREES, ICATB, and ATB RAISIN. We compared these databases and drafted recommendations for the creation of an optimized database of information on antibiotic use, available to all concerned personnel: healthcare authorities, healthcare facilities, and healthcare professionals.METHODOLOGY: We processed and analyzed the 3 databases (2008 data), and surveyed users.RESULTS: The qualitative analysis demonstrated major discrepancies in terms of objectives, healthcare facilities, participation rate, units of consumption, conditions for collection, consolidation, and control of data, and delay before availability of results. The quantitative analysis revealed that the consumption data for a given healthcare facility differed from one database to another, challenging the reliability of data collection. We specified user expectations: to compare consumption and resistance data, to carry out benchmarking, to obtain data on the prescribing habits in healthcare units, or to help understand results.CONCLUSIONS: The study results demonstrated the need for a reliable, single, and automated tool to manage data on antibiotic consumption compared with resistance data on several levels (national, regional, healthcare facility, healthcare units), providing rapid local feedback and educational benchmarking.","['Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Automation', 'Benchmarking', 'Cross Infection', 'Data Collection', 'Database Management Systems', 'Databases, Factual', 'Drug Utilization', 'France', 'Humans', 'Inappropriate Prescribing', 'Pharmacy Service, Hospital', 'Qualitative Research']",25015309,"[['D27.505.954.122.085'], ['J01.897.104'], ['N04.452.500.150', 'N04.761.685.150', 'N04.761.700.150', 'N05.700.150', 'N05.715.360.650.150'], ['C01.248', 'C23.550.291.875.500'], ['E05.318.308', 'L01.399.250', 'N05.715.360.300', 'N06.850.520.308'], ['L01.224.068', 'L01.224.900.280', 'N04.452.515.110'], ['L01.313.500.750.300.188.400', 'L01.470.750.750'], ['N04.452.706.477'], ['Z01.542.286'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E02.319.490', 'N02.421.450.500.249'], ['N02.278.216.500.968.603', 'N02.421.668.556', 'N04.452.442.452.422.603'], ['H01.770.644.241.850']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,1
Ingestion of bar soap may produce serious injury: clinical effects and risk factors.,"INTRODUCTION: Most household and body soaps have an alkaline pH (9-12). In addition to their foaming effect, they irritate the skin. This study aims to review soap exposure reported to the Angers Poison Control Centre.METHOD: A retrospective study of accidental or deliberate oral exposure to solid soaps reported to the Angers Poison Control Centre between 1 January 2000 and 1 April 2015. Poisoning severity was reassessed for each case according to the Poisoning Severity Score (PSS).RESULTS: 553 cases of exposure were recorded. In more than 40% of cases (n = 226), exposure occurred in community settings (retirement homes, nursing homes). Patients had a history of dementia in 220 cases (40%). The most common symptoms were labial oedema (28%, n = 153), oropharyngeal irritation (10%, n = 56), salivation (10%, n = 53), vomiting (9%, n = 48) and cough (8%, n = 45). Among symptomatic patients (n = 276), one patient died from aspiration pneumonia and one patient died from a cardiogenic shock following oropharyngeal oedema, vomiting, cough and bronchial obstruction. Patients with dementia were more often symptomatic (75% vs 34%, p < .001) and more frequently hospitalised (22% vs 0.8%, p < .001). They experienced more moderate to severe symptoms (8% vs 0%, p < .001). Mildly severe (PSS2, n = 14), highly severe (PSS3, n = 1) and fatal (PSS4, n = 2) poisoning were observed only in patients with dementia.CONCLUSION: Ingestion of soap bars is potentially serious, especially in patients with dementia. This type of soap should not be available to them in community settings and close monitoring should be considered in the event of oral exposure.","['Accidents, Home', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Dementia', 'Edema', 'Female', 'France', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Poisoning', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Soaps', 'Volition', 'Young Adult']",30307335,"[['N06.850.135.217'], ['M01.060.057'], ['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['M01.060.116.100.080'], ['M01.060.406'], ['M01.060.406.448'], ['C10.228.140.380', 'F03.615.400'], ['C23.888.277'], ['Z01.542.286'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.703'], ['M01.060.703.520'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['C25.723'], ['E05.318.372.500.500.500', 'E05.318.372.500.750.750', 'N05.715.360.330.500.500.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.825', 'N06.850.520.450.500.500.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.825'], ['E05.318.740.600.800.715', 'N04.452.871.715', 'N05.715.360.750.625.700.690', 'N06.850.505.715', 'N06.850.520.830.600.800.715'], ['E05.318.740.600.800.725', 'N05.715.350.200.700', 'N05.715.360.750.625.700.700', 'N06.850.490.625.750', 'N06.850.520.830.600.800.725'], ['E05.318.308.980.438.475.456.500', 'N05.715.360.300.800.438.375.364.500', 'N06.850.520.308.980.438.475.364.500'], ['D27.720.877.265.861', 'J01.516.872'], ['F02.463.902'], ['M01.060.116.815']]","['Health Care [N]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]']",0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,1
Melatonin alleviates behavioral deficits associated with apoptosis and cholinergic system dysfunction in the APP 695 transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.,"Melatonin is an endogenous antioxidant and free radical scavenger. A transgenic (Tg) mouse model for Alzheimer's disease mimics the accumulation of senile plaques, neuronal apoptosis and memory impairment. Previous studies indicated that melatonin reduced beta-amyloid (Abeta)-induced neurotoxicity. In this study, after giving melatonin at 10 mg/kg to APP 695 transgenic (APP 695 Tg) mice for 4 months, we evaluated the long-term influence of melatonin on behavior, biochemical and neuropathologic changes in APP 695 Tg mice. Step-down and step-through passive avoidance tests suggested that 8-month-old APP 695 Tg mice showed decreases in step-down latency and step-through latency and increases in count of error throughout the entire learning trial and memory session, which suggested learning and memory impairment. However, melatonin alleviated learning and memory deficits. Additionally, choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) activity also decreased in the frontal cortex and hippocampus of APP 695 Tg mice compared with non-Tg littermates. Melatonin supplementation increased ChAT activity in the frontal cortex and hippocampus. DNA fragmentation was present in the frontal cortex of the APP 695 Tg mice; melatonin reduced the number of apoptotic neurons. Congo Red staining and Bielschowsky silver impregnation both showed the apparent extracellular Abeta deposition in frontal cortex of APP 695 Tg mice. However, melatonin decreased the Abeta deposits. Our results indicate that neuroprotection by melatonin is partly related to modulation of apoptosis and protection of the cholinergic system. Early rational melatonin interventions may be one of the most promising strategies in the development of approaches to retard or prevent Abeta-mediated disease progression.","['Alzheimer Disease', 'Amyloid beta-Peptides', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Behavior, Animal', 'Brain', 'Choline O-Acetyltransferase', 'Cholinergic Fibers', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'In Situ Nick-End Labeling', 'Learning', 'Melatonin', 'Memory', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Neuroprotective Agents']",15298672,"[['C10.228.140.380.100', 'C10.574.945.249', 'F03.615.400.100'], ['D12.644.024', 'D12.776.049.407.249.500', 'D12.776.543.039.500'], ['B01.050'], ['G04.146.954.035'], ['F01.145.113'], ['A08.186.211'], ['D08.811.913.050.134.180'], ['A08.675.127.500', 'A08.675.542.234', 'A11.671.188.500', 'A11.671.501.234'], ['C22.232', 'E05.598.500', 'E05.599.395.080'], ['E05.393.475'], ['F02.463.425', 'F02.784.629.529'], ['D03.633.100.473.914.481', 'D06.472.506'], ['F02.463.425.540'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500'], ['B01.050.050.136.500', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500.800'], ['D27.505.696.706.548', 'D27.505.954.427.575']]","['Diseases [C]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

"The relationship of breakfast skipping and type of breakfast consumed with overweight/obesity, abdominal obesity, other cardiometabolic risk factors and the metabolic syndrome in young adults. The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES): 1999-2006.","OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between breakfast skipping and type of breakfast consumed with overweight/obesity, abdominal obesity, other cardiometabolic risk factors and the metabolic syndrome (MetS).DESIGN: Cross-sectional. Three breakfast groups were identified, breakfast skippers (BS), ready-to-eat-cereal (RTEC) consumers and other breakfast (OB) consumers, using a 24 h dietary recall. Risk factors were compared between the breakfast groups using covariate-adjusted statistical procedures.SETTING: The 1999–2006 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, USA.SUBJECTS: Young adults (20–39 years of age).RESULTS: Among these young adults (n 5316), 23.8% were BS, 16.5% were RTEC consumers and 59.7% were OB consumers. Relative to the BS, the RTEC consumers were 31%, 39%, 37%, 28%, 23%, 40% and 42% less likely to be overweight/obese or have abdominal obesity, elevated blood pressure, elevated serum total cholesterol, elevated serum LDL-cholesterol, reduced serum HDL-cholesterol or elevated serum insulin, respectively. Relative to the OB consumers, the BS were 1.24, 1.26 and 1.44 times more likely to have elevated serum total cholesterol, elevated serum LDL-cholesterol or reduced serum HDL-cholesterol, respectively. Relative to the OB consumers, the RTEC consumers were 22%, 31% and 24% less likely to be overweight/ obese or have abdominal obesity or elevated blood pressure, respectively. No difference was seen in the prevalence of the MetS by breakfast skipping or type of breakfast consumed.CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that consumption of breakfast, especially that included an RTEC, was associated with an improved cardiometabolic risk profile in U.S. young adults. Additional studies are needed to determine the nature of these relationships.","['Adult', 'Blood Pressure', 'Breakfast', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cholesterol', 'Cholesterol, HDL', 'Cholesterol, LDL', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Diet', 'Diet Records', 'Edible Grain', 'Fast Foods', 'Feeding Behavior', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hypertension', 'Insulin', 'Male', 'Mental Recall', 'Metabolic Syndrome', 'Nutrition Surveys', 'Obesity', 'Obesity, Abdominal', 'Overweight', 'Risk Factors', 'Young Adult']",23031568,"[['M01.060.116'], ['E01.370.600.875.249', 'G09.330.380.076'], ['G07.203.300.590.120', 'J02.500.590.120'], ['C14'], ['D04.210.500.247.222.284', 'D04.210.500.247.808.197', 'D10.570.938.208'], ['D04.210.500.247.808.197.238', 'D10.532.432.400', 'D10.570.938.208.270', 'D12.776.521.479.470'], ['D04.210.500.247.808.197.244', 'D10.532.515.500', 'D10.570.938.208.275', 'D12.776.521.550.500'], ['E05.318.372.500.875', 'N05.715.360.330.500.875', 'N06.850.520.450.500.875'], ['G07.203.650.240'], ['N04.452.859.360'], ['A18.024.500.750.500', 'B01.650.160.250', 'B01.650.510.250', 'G07.203.300.300.550', 'G07.203.300.775.500', 'J02.500.300.550', 'J02.500.775.500'], ['G07.203.300.477', 'J02.500.477'], ['F01.145.113.547', 'F01.145.407', 'G07.203.650.353'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C14.907.489'], ['D06.472.699.587.200.500.625', 'D12.644.548.586.200.500.625'], ['F02.463.425.540.641'], ['C18.452.394.968.500.570', 'C18.452.625'], ['E05.318.308.980.485', 'N05.715.360.300.800.469', 'N06.850.505.616', 'N06.850.520.308.980.469'], ['C18.654.726.500', 'C23.888.144.699.500', 'E01.370.600.115.100.160.120.699.500', 'G07.100.100.160.120.699.500'], ['C18.654.726.500.615', 'E01.370.600.115.100.160.120.699.500.249', 'G07.100.100.160.120.699.500.249'], ['C23.888.144.699', 'E01.370.600.115.100.160.120.699', 'G07.100.100.160.120.699'], ['E05.318.740.600.800.725', 'N05.715.350.200.700', 'N05.715.360.750.625.700.700', 'N06.850.490.625.750', 'N06.850.520.830.600.800.725'], ['M01.060.116.815']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]']",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0
Young adults' attitudes to sharing whole-genome sequencing information: a university-based survey.,"BACKGROUND: Genomic services are increasingly accessible to young adults starting their independent lives with responsibility for their self-care, yet their attitudes to sharing genomic information remain under-researched. This study explored attitudes of university-based 18-25 year-olds towards sharing personal whole-genome sequencing (WGS) information with relatives.METHODS: We surveyed 112 young adults. Hypotheses were tested regarding the relationships between their preferences for sharing personal WGS information with relatives and factors including their gender, previous genetics-specific education, general educational attainment level and current study in a science, technology, engineering, maths or medicine (STEMM) field.RESULTS: Most participants were positive about both their intention to share their WGS results with their parents and siblings, and their desire to know their relatives' results. Being female and having a university-level genetics education were consistently positively correlated with intention to share one's results with parents and with siblings as well as the desire to know relatives' results. Additionally, females who had undertaken a genetics course at university had significantly greater intentions and desires than females who had not. Lower general educational attainment was related to a lower intention to share with siblings. Participants who were in a STEMM field had a greater desire to know their relatives' results.CONCLUSIONS: Participants' gender and prior genetics education were consistently related to their intentions to share WGS results with relatives and their desire to know relatives' results. Educational attainment was found to be positively correlated with intention to share with siblings. Being in a STEMM field was related to participants' desire to know their relatives' results. These findings indicate that gender and genetics education are particularly important influencers on young adults' stated sharing preferences. More research is required to examine the dependent variables studied to further understand their influence on attitudes to sharing WGS results.

The control diets (CON-CaP and CON-NaP, respectively) did not contain any added phosphorus. Calcium/phosphorus ratio was adjusted to 1.3/1 by adding calcium carbonate. Twenty-three cats were available for the trials. All cats were fed the control diets for 29 days; then, the HP diets were tested for 29 days against controls in a crossover design. Faeces and urine were collected in the last 10 days of each trial. Phosphorus in food, faeces and urine was measured by photometry after wet digestion. Phosphorus intake amounted to 84 ± 10 mg/kg body weight (BW) in CON-NaP (n = 13) and to 74 ± 7 in CON-CaP (n = 12). In the HP groups, the intake was 255 ± 34 mg/kg BW (HP-NaP; n = 13) and 216 ± 20 mg/kg BW (HP-CaP; n = 12). The sodium monophosphate in group HP-NaP led to a higher renal phosphorus excretion (83 ± 15 mg/kg BW) than the calcium monophosphate (25 ± 5 mg/kg BW; p < 0.05), even though the apparent phosphorus digestibility was higher in HP-CaP than in HP-NaP (p < 0.05). Faecal calcium excretion was strictly correlated to faecal phosphorus excretion (r2  = 0.98). The same was true for calcium and phosphorus balance (r2  = 0.89). In group HP-NaP, seven of 13 cats showed glucosuria. By contrast, in HP-CaP glucosuria was not observed. Highly water-soluble inorganic phosphorus sources such as sodium phosphate are likely to lead to phosphaturia and may present a risk for renal health of cats.","['Animal Feed', 'Animal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena', 'Animals', 'Calcium Phosphates', 'Cats', 'Cross-Over Studies', 'Diet', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Interactions', 'Feces', 'Female', 'Male', 'Phosphates', 'Phosphorus', 'Phosphorus, Dietary', 'Urinalysis']",30151843,"[['G07.203.300.300.100', 'J02.500.300.100'], ['G07.203.650.161'], ['B01.050'], ['D01.029.260.700.675.374.075', 'D01.146.360', 'D01.695.625.675.650.075'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.750.377.750.250.125'], ['E05.318.370.150', 'N05.715.360.325.150', 'N06.850.520.445.150'], ['G07.203.650.240'], ['G07.690.773.875', 'G07.690.936.500'], ['G07.690.773.968'], ['A12.459'], ['D01.029.260.700.675.374', 'D01.248.497.158.730', 'D01.695.625.675.650'], ['D01.268.666'], ['D01.695.635'], ['E01.370.225.124.810', 'E01.370.390.810', 'E05.200.124.810']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0
"Bioactivation of the tobacco carcinogens 4-aminobiphenyl (4-ABP) and 2-amino-9H-pyrido[2,3-b]indole (AáC) in human bladder RT4 cells.","Occupational and tobacco exposure to aromatic amines (AAs) including 4-aminobiphenyl (4-ABP) and 2-naphthylamine (2-NA) are associated with bladder cancer (BC) risk. Several epidemiological studies have also reported a possible role for structurally related heterocyclic aromatic amines (HAAs) formed in tobacco smoke or cooked meats with BC risk. We had screened for DNA adducts of 4-ABP, 2-NA, and several prominent HAAs formed in tobacco smoke or grilled meats including 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP), 2-amino-3,8-dimethylmidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline (MeIQx), and 2-amino-9H-pyrido[2,3-b]indole (AáC) in the bladder DNA of BC patients, using liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry. We detected DNA adducts of 4-ABP, but not adducts of the other carcinogens. In this study, we have examined the capacity of RT4 cells, an epithelial human bladder cell line, to bioactivate AAs and HAAs to DNA damaging agents, which may contribute to BC. 4-ABP and AáC formed DNA adducts, but DNA adducts of 2-NA, PhIP, and MeIQx were not detected. 4-ABP DNA adducts were formed at tenfold higher levels than AáC adducts. Pretreatment of RT4 cells with á-naphthoflavone (1-10 µM), a specific cytochrome P450 1 (CYP1) inhibitor, decreased AáC adduct formation by 50% but did not affect the level of 4-ABP adducts. However, cell pretreatment with 8-methoxypsoralen (0.1-1 µM), a potent inhibitor of CYP2A, resulted in a 90% decrease of 4-ABP DNA adducts levels. These data signify that CYP2A and CYP1A isoforms expressed in the target urothelium bioactivate 4-ABP and AáC, respectively, and may be a critical feature of aromatic amine-induced urinary bladder carcinogenesis. The bioactivation of other tobacco and environmental AAs by bladder CYPs and their ensuing bladder DNA damage warrants further study.","['2-Naphthylamine', 'Aminobiphenyl Compounds', 'Carbolines', 'Carcinogens', 'Cell Line', 'Chromatography, Liquid', 'DNA Adducts', 'DNA Damage', 'Humans', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Urinary Bladder']",31203411,"[['D02.092.710', 'D02.455.426.559.847.638.850', 'D04.615.638.850'], ['D02.455.426.559.389.185.060'], ['D03.383.725.150', 'D03.633.100.473.155', 'D03.633.300.154'], ['D27.888.569.100'], ['A11.251.210'], ['E05.196.181.400'], ['D13.444.308.135', 'G05.200.104'], ['G05.200'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E05.196.566'], ['A05.810.890']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Effect of counter-ions and penetration enhancers on the skin permeation of flurbiprofen.,"The aim of this work was to investigate the percutaneous absorption of flurbiprofen (FP) using counter-ions as enhancers as well as to compare their enhancing activity with penetration enhancers in vitro. The in vitro permeation studies of FP were performed in isopropyl myristate (IPM) solution by two-chamber diffusion cells, using rat abdominal skin as a model. Among the penetration enhancers examined, including the cosolvents of propylene glycol and ethanol (EtOH), oleic acid, menthol, laurocapram, sorbitan monooleate, and N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP), 10% (w/w) EtOH and NMP exhibited the most potent solubilization and enhancing effects of FP from IPM, with a flux of (372.60 +/- 45.12) microg/cm(2)/h and (474.21 +/- 46.64) microg/cm(2)/h, respectively. Ten percent (w/w) EtOH/IPM binary system was used to investigate the effect of the counter-ions, namely diethylamine (DEA), triethylamine (TEA), ethanolamine (EtA), diethanolamine (DEtA), triethanolamine (TEtA), and N-(2'-hydroxyethanol)-piperdine (HEPP). The cumulative amounts were markedly increased in the presence of the counter-ions, and the highest flux of (1297.53 +/- 121.81) microg/cm(2)/h was obtained by DEA. This was related to the decreased lipophilicity and different physicochemical properties of the ion-pairs. In particular, we proved the formation of an FP/amine ion-pair in solution by (1)H-NMR. The results suggest that the counter-ions are more efficient than penetration enhancers.","['Amines', 'Animals', 'Ethanol', 'Flurbiprofen', 'Ions', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Male', 'Propylene Glycol', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar', 'Skin', 'Skin Absorption']",19894269,"[['D02.092'], ['B01.050'], ['D02.033.375'], ['D02.241.081.751.161', 'D02.455.426.559.389.185.350'], ['D01.248.497'], ['E05.196.867.519'], ['D02.033.455.706.725'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700.900'], ['A17.815'], ['G03.015.500.750', 'G03.787.024.500.750', 'G07.690.725.015.500.750', 'G13.750.778']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

[Sodium- and water balance in the dog in the conscious state and under nitrous-oxide and barbiturate anesthesia (author's transl)].,"By a suitable pattern of saline infusion we established an equilibrium between input and renal output of sodium and water in the conscious animal, which was maintained for six hours. During this period of equilibrium we found an increase in GFR, plasma volume and functional ECFV of about 30% each, the amount of intravascular protein and albumin being unchanged. Under nitrous-oxide and thiopentone anaesthesia renal sodium and water excretion was unchanged compared with values of conscious animals. However there was a striking decrease in plasma volume as well as in circulating protein and albumin by approximately 20%. Similarly functional ECFV (sulphate space) was found to be reduced under thiopentone anaesthesia. Retention of sodium about 12 hours after the end of anesthesia amounted to 7% of the quantities infused (about 50 mval per animal), whilst the applied water load had been completely excreted.","['Anesthesia', 'Animals', 'Barbiturates', 'Dogs', 'Extracellular Space', 'Female', 'Nitrous Oxide', 'Plasma Volume', 'Sodium', 'Water-Electrolyte Balance']",1217690,"[['E03.155'], ['B01.050'], ['D03.383.742.698.253'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.750.250.216.200'], ['A10.082.500', 'A11.284.295'], ['D01.362.635.625', 'D01.625.550.550', 'D01.650.550.587.650'], ['G09.188.130.610', 'G09.330.380.092.610'], ['D01.268.549.750', 'D01.268.557.650', 'D01.552.528.850', 'D01.552.547.725'], ['G02.111.635.500', 'G03.615.500', 'G07.410.810.500']]","['Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Evaluating and prescribing new medicines in general practice.,"BACKGROUND: In Australia, the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) approves new medicines that general practitioners (GPs) may prescribe. Medicines listed under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) have undergone a rigorous independent evaluation in relation to comparative efficacy, safety and effectiveness against medicines already on the market. However, GPs need to appraise the medicines they prescribe for individual patients, taking a number of factors into consideration.OBJECTIVE: The aim of this article is to assist GPs' decision making when prescribing new medicines, and provide information about the most reliable sources of unbiased information to help them evaluate the risks and benefits in partnership with their patients.DISCUSSION: GPs require accurate summaries of a medicine's properties, efficacy and side‑effect profile from trusted sources such as the Australian Medicines Handbook, Therapeutic Guidelines, NPS MedicineWise, Australian Prescriber or the TGA.

Noninvasive measurements of nonlinear arterial elasticity.,"To describe fully the compliance characteristics of an artery with nonlinear elastic properties, measurements must be obtained over a wide range of pressures. Furthermore, repeated measurements, as required in temporal studies of arterial implants, require that the measuring technique be noninvasive. The application of a pulsed ultrasound echo-tracking device is described, which fulfills both criteria. Nonlinear compliance-pressure (CP) curves were obtained from the femoral arteries of dogs, with the use of halothane anesthesia to vary systemic pressure, and were used to compare the gross elastic properties of different vessels. Studies using controlled hemorrhage or the vasoactive drugs, nitroprusside and levarterenol (norepinephrine), were used to verify that the CP curves obtained during halothane anesthesia did not reflect varying degrees of smooth muscle activation. However, surgical exposure did temporarily reduce arterial compliance at pressures between 60 and 140 mmHg. The effect of vasoactive intervention and of postsurgical changes in arterial or graft compliance can thus be quantitated by use of CP curves or by comparing incremental elastic moduli, which can also be estimated from the noninvasively derived measurements.","['Animals', 'Arteries', 'Blood Flow Velocity', 'Dogs', 'Elasticity', 'Femoral Artery', 'Hypotension', 'Mathematics', 'Pressure', 'Rheology', 'Ultrasonics']",3946617,"[['B01.050'], ['A07.015.114'], ['E01.370.370.130', 'G09.330.380.630.080'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.750.250.216.200'], ['G01.374.590'], ['A07.015.114.351'], ['C14.907.514'], ['H01.548'], ['G01.374.715'], ['E05.830', 'H01.671.808'], ['H01.671.031.849']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]']",1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
Study of genetic variance in the fluctuating asymmetry of anthropometrical traits.,"We have studied the fluctuating asymmetry (FA) of 8 bilateral morphometric traits in two-parent families, comprising 216 families with one newborn baby, and 60 families with two children (age range 5-18 years). Heritability was assessed by: (1) multiple regression analyses of the children's measurements on the mother's and father's measurements; (2) midparent-child regressions; and (3) sibling correlations. The extent of genetic determination of individual FA measurements was generally low, albeit statistically significant in some cases. However, even these correlations were inconsistent between samples and relatives. However, the mean FA values for all 8 studied traits showed positive and significant correlation between parents and children in two samples and in total. Additive genetic variance, calculated from multiple regression analyses and midparent-child correlations, was estimated to be between 0.25-0.30. Three multiple regressions (two for the separate group and one for the total sample) yielded a statistically significant value (between 0.21-0.33) also for the non-additive genetic component.","['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Anthropometry', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Family', 'Female', 'Genetic Variation', 'Humans', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Israel', 'Male', 'Nuclear Family']",2729889,"[['M01.060.057'], ['M01.060.116'], ['E01.370.600.024', 'E05.041', 'N06.850.505.200.100'], ['M01.060.406'], ['M01.060.406.448'], ['F01.829.263', 'I01.880.853.150'], ['G05.365'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.703.520'], ['Z01.252.245.500.375'], ['F01.829.263.500', 'I01.880.853.150.500']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Geographicals [Z]']",0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1
X-ray absorption spectroscopy of the copper chaperone HAH1 reveals a linear two-coordinate Cu(I) center capable of adduct formation with exogenous thiols and phosphines.,"The human copper chaperone HAH1 transports copper to the Menkes and Wilson proteins, which are copper-translocating P-type ATPases located in the trans-Golgi apparatus and believed to provide copper for important enzymes such as ceruloplasmin, tyrosinase, and peptidylglycine monooxygenase. Although a substantial amount of structural data exist for HAH1 and its yeast and bacterial homologues, details of the copper coordination remain unclear and suggest the presence of two protein-derived cysteine ligands and a third exogenous thiol ligand. Here we report the preparation and reconstitution of HAH1 with Cu(I) using a protocol that minimizes the use of thiol reagents believed to be the source of the third ligand. We show by x-ray absorption spectroscopy that this reconstitution protocol generates an occupied Cu(I) binding site with linear biscysteinate coordination geometry, as evidenced by (i) an intense edge absorption centered at 8982.5 eV, with energy and intensity identical to the rigorously linear two-coordinate model complex bis-2,3,5,6-tetramethylbenzene thiolate Cu(I) and (ii) an EXAFS spectrum that could be fit to two Cu-S interactions at 2.16 A, a distance typical of digonal Cu(I) coordination. Binding of exogenous ligands (GSH, dithiothreitol, and tris-(2-carboxyethyl)-phosphine) to the Cu(I) was investigated. When GSH or dithiothreitol was added to the chaperone during the reconstitution procedure, the resulting Cu(I)- HAH1 remained two-coordinate, whereas the addition of the phosphine during reconstitution elicited a three-coordinate species. When the exogenous ligands were titrated into the Cu(I)-HAH1, all formed three-coordinate adducts but with differing affinities. Thus, GSH and dithiothreitol showed weaker binding, with estimated KD values in the range 10-25 mm, whereas tris-(2-carboxyethyl)-phosphine showed stronger affinity, with a KD value of <5 mm.

Fluoroquinolone-resistant acute prostatitis requiring hospitalization after transrectal prostate biopsy: effect of previous fluoroquinolone use as prophylaxis or long-term treatment.,"OBJECTIVES: This study aims to scrutinize the hospitalized patients with the diagnosis of acute prostatitis after transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy of the prostate (TRUSBP) focusing their history of previous antibiotic use, clinical pictures, microbiologic features, and resistance patterns of the isolates.PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective evaluation of the records between 2005 and 2010 revealed 13 patients. All patients received ciprofloxacin 500 mg twice a day starting from the day before TRUSBP for 5 days.RESULTS: Positive 13 urine and 7 blood samples (Escherichia coli in 12 patients, Enterococcus species in one) were evaluated for resistance patterns. All were resistant to fluoroquinolones. Extended spectrum beta-lactamase producing E. coli isolated in 4 patients were treated with carbapenems. Empirical ceftriaxone was shifted to carbapenem (4 patients), vancomycin (1 patient). Empirical carbapenem was maintained in 5 patients. Seven patients with elevated PSA received fluoroquinolones for 4 weeks before TRUSBP on the assumption that they had subclinical infectious prostatitis. Previous exposure to fluoroquinolones did not lead to important differences in respect to the studied parameters.CONCLUSIONS: The prompt initiation of effective treatment is essential to decrease morbidity and mortality. Empirical treatment would be a second or third generation cephalosporins, or carbapenems according to clinical severity of patients.","['Aged', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Anti-Infective Agents', 'Antibiotic Prophylaxis', 'Biopsy', 'Carbapenems', 'Ceftriaxone', 'Ciprofloxacin', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple, Bacterial', 'Enterococcus', 'Escherichia coli', 'Escherichia coli Infections', 'Fluoroquinolones', 'Hospitalization', 'Humans', 'Length of Stay', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prostate', 'Prostate-Specific Antigen', 'Prostatitis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Vancomycin']",21547465,"[['M01.060.116.100'], ['D27.505.954.122.085'], ['D27.505.954.122'], ['E02.319.162.150', 'E02.319.703.150'], ['E01.370.225.500.384.100', 'E01.370.225.998.054', 'E01.370.388.100', 'E04.074', 'E05.200.500.384.100', 'E05.200.998.054', 'E05.242.384.100'], ['D02.065.589.099.124', 'D03.633.100.300.124'], ['D02.065.589.099.249.190.190.155', 'D02.886.665.074.190.190.155', 'D03.633.100.300.249.190.190.155'], ['D03.633.100.810.835.322.186'], ['G06.099.225.812', 'G06.225.347.812', 'G07.690.773.984.269.347.812', 'G07.690.773.984.300.500'], ['B03.353.750.250.250', 'B03.510.550.250.250'], ['B03.440.450.425.325.300', 'B03.660.250.150.180.100'], ['C01.150.252.400.310.330'], ['D03.633.100.810.835.322'], ['E02.760.400', 'N02.421.585.400'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E02.760.400.480', 'N02.421.585.400.480'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['A05.360.444.575', 'A10.336.707'], ['D08.811.277.656.300.760.442.750', 'D08.811.277.656.959.350.442.750', 'D12.776.866.249.500', 'D23.050.285.625', 'D23.101.140.625'], ['C12.294.565.750'], ['E05.318.372.500.500.500', 'E05.318.372.500.750.750', 'N05.715.360.330.500.500.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.825', 'N06.850.520.450.500.500.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.825'], ['D09.400.420.925', 'D12.644.233.925']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
Sex differences in energetic costs explain sexual dimorphism in the circadian rhythm modulation of the electrocommunication signal of the gymnotiform fish Brachyhypopomus pinnicaudatus.,"To understand the evolution of sexually dimorphic communication signals, we must quantify their costs, including their energetic costs, the regulation of these costs, and the difference between the costs for the sexes. Here, we provide the first direct measurements of the relative energy expended on electric signals and show for the focal species Brachyhypopomus pinnicaudatus that males spend a significantly greater proportion of their total energy budget on signal generation (11-22%) compared with females (3%). Both sexes significantly reduce the energy spent on electric signals during daylight hours through circadian modulation of the amplitude, duration and repetition rate of the electric signal, but this effect is more marked in males. Male body condition predicted the energy spent on electric signals (R(2)=0.75). The oxygen consumed by males for signal production closely paralleled the product of the electric signal's waveform area (R(2)=0.99) and the discharge rate (R(2)=0.59), two signal parameters that can be assessed directly by conspecifics. Thus the electric communication signal of males carries the information to reveal their body condition to prospective mates and competing males. Because the electric signal constitutes a significant fraction of the energy budget, energy savings, along with predation avoidance, provides an adaptive basis for the production of circadian rhythms in electric signals.","['Animal Communication', 'Animals', 'Circadian Rhythm', 'Electric Organ', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Female', 'Gymnotiformes', 'Male', 'Models, Biological', 'Oxygen Consumption', 'Sex Characteristics', 'Signal Transduction']",18310126,"[['F01.145.113.055'], ['B01.050'], ['G07.180.562.190'], ['A13.332'], ['G03.295'], ['B01.050.150.900.493.378.430'], ['E05.599.395'], ['G03.680'], ['G08.686.815'], ['G02.111.820', 'G04.835']]","['Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
A Glycine soja 14-3-3 protein GsGF14o participates in stomatal and root hair development and drought tolerance in Arabidopsis thaliana.,"It is well established that 14-3-3 proteins are key regulators of multiple stress signal transduction cascades. However, the biological functions of soybean 14-3-3 proteins, especially in plant drought response, are not yet known. In this study, we characterized a Glycine soja 14-3-3 gene, GsGF14o, which is involved in plant development and drought response. GsGF14o expression was greatly induced by drought stress, as evidenced by the quantitative real-time PCR and â-glucuronidase (GUS) activity analysis. GsGF14o overexpression in Arabidopsis thaliana resulted in decreased drought tolerance during seed germination and seedling growth. Furthermore, silencing of AtGF14µ, the most homologous 14-3-3 gene of GsGF14o, led to enhanced drought tolerance at both the seed germination and seedling stage. Unexpectedly, GsGF14o transgenic lines showed reduced water loss and transpiration rates compared with wild-type plants, which was demonstrated to be the consequence of the decreased stomatal size. At the same time, the smaller stomata due to GsGF14o overexpression led to a relatively slow net photosynthesis rate, which led to a growth penalty under drought stress. We further demonstrated that GsGF14o overexpression caused deficits in root hair formation and development, and thereby reduced the water intake capacity of the transgenic root system. In addition, GsGF14o overexpression down-regulated the transcript levels of drought-responsive marker genes. Finally, we also investigated the tissue-specific accumulation of GsGF14o by using a GUS activity assay. Collectively, the results presented here confirm that GsGF14o plays a dual role in drought stress responses through its involvement in the regulation of stomatal size and root hair development.","['14-3-3 Proteins', 'Adaptation, Physiological', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Arabidopsis', 'Droughts', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Plant', 'Gene Knockout Techniques', 'Genes, Plant', 'Germination', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Osmotic Pressure', 'Photosynthesis', 'Plant Roots', 'Plant Stomata', 'Plants, Genetically Modified', 'RNA, Messenger', 'Seeds', 'Sequence Analysis, Protein', 'Soybean Proteins', 'Soybeans', 'Stress, Physiological']",24272249,"[['D12.644.360.024.050', 'D12.776.157.057.002', 'D12.776.476.024.050'], ['G07.025', 'G16.012.500'], ['G02.111.570.060', 'L01.453.245.667.060'], ['B01.650.940.800.575.912.250.157.100'], ['G16.500.175.781', 'G16.500.750.775.154', 'N06.230.100.230.150'], ['G05.308.375'], ['E05.393.335.750'], ['G05.360.340.024.340.393', 'G05.360.340.365.500'], ['G07.345.625.249', 'G15.357'], ['L01.453.245.667'], ['G01.374.715.578', 'G02.640.249', 'G02.723.661'], ['G02.111.158.937', 'G02.111.669.700', 'G02.740.921', 'G03.191.937', 'G03.493.700', 'G03.800.700', 'G15.568'], ['A18.400'], ['A18.024.750.650', 'A18.024.812.650'], ['B01.650.520', 'B05.620.600'], ['D13.444.735.544'], ['A18.024.500.750', 'G07.203.300.775', 'J02.500.775'], ['E05.393.760.705'], ['D12.776.765.741', 'G07.203.300.428.920.750', 'G07.203.300.850.450.500.750', 'J02.500.428.920.750', 'J02.500.850.800.500.750'], ['B01.650.940.800.575.912.250.401.750'], ['G07.775']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0
Scirrhous colonic metastasis from ductal carcinoma of the breast: report of a case.,"Metastasis of breast cancer to the colon is rare. We report a case of a 49-year-old female who presented with a stenotic tumor of the descending colon five years after treatment of breast cancer with mastectomy and pedicled transverse rectus abdominis musculocutaneous flap. Laparotomy showed a diffusely infiltrated tumor over the descending colon. Anterior resection with loop ileostomy was performed, and the pathology showed that the colonic wall and the mesentery were diffusely infiltrated with poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma, which stained strongly for cytokeratin 7. The histologic diagnosis is consistent with colonic metastasis from ductal carcinoma of breast origin. In a patient with a history of breast cancer, colonic metastasis from the breast primary cancer should be considered, especially if the colonic lesion is scirrhous in nature. The incision for laparotomy and the probable stoma site should be planned carefully in females after breast reconstructive surgery.","['Adenocarcinoma, Scirrhous', 'Breast Neoplasms', 'Carcinoma, Ductal', 'Colonic Neoplasms', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Middle Aged']",14530687,"[['C04.557.470.200.025.095'], ['C04.588.180', 'C17.800.090.500'], ['C04.557.470.200.025.232', 'C04.557.470.615.132'], ['C04.588.274.476.411.307.180', 'C06.301.371.411.307.180', 'C06.405.249.411.307.180', 'C06.405.469.158.356.180', 'C06.405.469.491.307.180'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.116.630']]","['Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Named Groups [M]']",0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
Postprandial increase of cardiac output in patients with acute myocardial infarction.,"The influence on the hemodynamics of oral and intravenous nourishment containing the same amount of calories in comparison to isotonic solution of sodium chloride was studied in 14 patients with acute myocardial infarction. Forty minutes after administration of nourishment, a 34% increase in cardiac index, rising from 2.61 +/- 0.43 to 3.49 +/- 0.68 l/min/m2 was measured in the oral group, P less than 0.001. The increase was 22% (from 2.75 +/- 0.54 to 3.36 +/- 0.83 l/min/m2) in the intravenous group, P less than 0.025. Stroke index rose by 26% (from 33.4 +/- 7.8 to 42.1 +/- 10.6 ml/m2) in the oral group, P less than 0.025; and by 13% (from 32.7 +/- 8.3 to 37.0 +/- 9.7 ml/m2) in the intravenous group, P less than 0.05. No increases were seen in heart rate, mean blood pressure and pulmonary arterial diastolic pressure. The systemic vascular resistance decreased significantly in both groups.

Revealing the Usefulness of Aroma Networks to Explain Wine Aroma Properties: A Case Study of Portuguese Wines.,"Wine aroma is the result of complex interactions between volatile compounds and non-volatile ones and individual perception phenomenon. In this work, an aroma network approach, that links volatile composition (chromatographic data) with its corresponding aroma descriptors was used to explain the wine aroma properties. This concept was applied to six monovarietal wines from Bairrada Appellation (Portugal) and used as a case study. A comprehensive determination of the wines' volatile composition was done (71 variables, i.e., volatile components), establishing a workflow that combines extraction techniques and gas chromatographic analysis. Then, a bipartite network-based approach consisting of two different nodes was built, one with 19 aroma descriptors, and the other with the corresponding volatile compound(s). To construct the aroma networks, the odor active values were calculated for each determined compound and combined with the bipartite network. Finally, the aroma network of each wine was compared with sensory descriptive analysis. The analysis of the specific aroma network of each wine revealed that Sauvignon Blanc and Arinto white wines present higher fruity (esters) and sweet notes (esters and C13 norisoprenoids) than Bical wine. Sauvignon Blanc also exhibits higher toasted aromas (thiols) while Arinto and Bical wines exhibit higher flowery (C13 norisoprenoids) and herbaceous notes (thiols), respectively. For red wines, sweet fruit aromas are the most abundant, especially for Touriga Nacional. Castel?o and Touriga Nacional wines also present toasted aromas (thiols). Baga and Castel?o wines also exhibit fusel/alcohol notes (alcohols). The proposed approach establishes a chemical aroma fingerprint (aroma ID) for each type of wine, which may be further used to estimate wine aroma characteristics by projection of the volatile composition on the aroma network.","['Chromatography, Gas', 'Fruit', 'Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry', 'Humans', 'Norisoprenoids', 'Odorants', 'Portugal', 'Sulfhydryl Compounds', 'Vitis', 'Volatile Organic Compounds', 'Wine']",31936556,"[['E05.196.181.349'], ['A18.024.500', 'G07.203.300.562', 'J02.500.562'], ['E05.196.181.349.500', 'E05.196.566.500'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D02.455.326.271.665.202.309', 'D02.455.426.392.368.367.379.249.375', 'D02.455.849.131.309'], ['G16.500.275.640', 'N06.230.480'], ['Z01.542.727'], ['D02.886.489'], ['B01.650.940.800.575.912.250.965.500'], ['D02.974'], ['G07.203.100.100.900', 'G07.203.200.887', 'J02.200.100.900', 'J02.350.887']]","['Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Geographicals [Z]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1
Change in the body temperature of healthy term infant over the first 72 hours of life.,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the range of body temperature in a group of healthy Chinese term neonates over the first 72 hours of life and to assess the influence of body weight, gestational age and route of delivery.METHOD: All 200 consecutive cases of neonates delivered at our hospital from March to August 2001 were included in this retrospective study. Temperatures were measured immediately after delivery, after 30 minutes, 1 hour, 2 hours, 8 hours and 15 hours and on the 2nd and 3rd day. Axillary temperatures ranging from 36.5 degrees C to 37 degrees C were regarded as normal. No cases of maternal fever or systemic infection of the newborns were discovered. All infants were discharged in good general condition.RESULTS: The mean rectal temperature at birth was 37.19 degrees C. The lowest average temperature was reached at 1 hour after delivery (36.54 degrees C) with a significant difference between natural delivery (36.48 degrees C) and section (36.59 degrees C) (P<0.05). Temperature subsequently rose to 36.70 degrees C at 8 hours and 36.78 degrees C at 15 hours (P<0.05). Hypothermia was seen in 51.8% and hypothermia in 42.5% of the patients. On the 3rd day after delivery, 96% of all temperatures were in the normal range. A significant relation was found between hypothermia and both low birth weight (P<0.001) and low gestational age (P<0.05).CONCLUSION: The reference range presently used did not include all physiological temperatures in the first 72 hours of life. Considering other factors, such as birth weight, route of delivery, gestational age and body temperature on the 2nd and 3rd day of life, may help to correctly assess the significance of temperatures beyond the reference range.","['Adaptation, Physiological', 'Age Factors', 'Birth Weight', 'Body Temperature', 'China', 'Female', 'Fever', 'Gestational Age', 'Humans', 'Hypothermia', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Retrospective Studies']",14994443,"[['G07.025', 'G16.012.500'], ['N05.715.350.075', 'N06.850.490.250'], ['C23.888.144.186', 'E01.370.600.115.100.160.120.186', 'E05.041.124.160.750.149', 'G07.100.100.160.120.186', 'G07.345.249.314.120.186'], ['E01.370.600.875.374', 'G07.110'], ['Z01.252.474.164'], ['C23.888.119.344'], ['G07.345.500.325.235.968', 'G08.686.320'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C23.888.119.565'], ['M01.060.703.520'], ['E05.318.372.500.500.500', 'E05.318.372.500.750.750', 'N05.715.360.330.500.500.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.825', 'N06.850.520.450.500.500.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.825']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Named Groups [M]']",0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1
Patient education using virtual reality increases knowledge and positive experience for breast cancer patients undergoing radiation therapy.,"PURPOSE: Improved access to technology in the radiation therapy (RT) workforce education has resulted in opportunities for innovative patient education methods. This study investigated the impact of a newly developed education tool using the Virtual Environment for Radiotherapy Training (VERT) system on patients' RT knowledge and anxiety.METHOD: Breast cancer patients were recruited into a control group (CG) (n = 18) who underwent the standard pre-RT education package at a targeted cancer therapy centre, followed by a VERT group (VG) (n = 19). VG patients attended a VERT-based education session detailing RT immobilisation, planning and treatment. All patients completed questionnaires at four time points throughout their treatment, with survey sub-sections on RT knowledge, experience and anxiety.RESULTS: For both groups, anxiety levels were highest at time point 1(T1 after initial radiation oncologist consultation) (CG, 41.2; VG, 43.1), with a gradual decrease observed thereafter at time points before simulation, at the beginning of treatment and at the end of treatment (p > 0.05). The VG's RT knowledge scores were statistically significantly higher than those of the CG scores at all time points following VERT education (p < 0.05).CONCLUSION: This study reports the high value of VERT breast cancer-targeted education programs in improving RT knowledge and perhaps decreasing patient anxiety. Continued efforts are required to improve patients' accessibility to VERT in Australia, and to better understand the effect of VERT's unique educational features on patients' emotional and physical needs throughout their RT.","['Adult', 'Aged', 'Breast Neoplasms', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Knowledge', 'Middle Aged', 'Patient Education as Topic', 'Patient Reported Outcome Measures', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Virtual Reality']",29536200,"[['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['C04.588.180', 'C17.800.090.500'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['K01.468'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['I02.233.332.500', 'N02.421.726.407.680'], ['E05.318.308.980.344.500', 'N03.349.380.210.750', 'N04.761.559.590.399.875', 'N05.425.210.500', 'N05.715.360.300.800.344.500', 'N05.715.360.575.575.399.875', 'N06.850.520.308.980.344.500'], ['E05.318.308.980', 'N05.715.360.300.800', 'N06.850.520.308.980'], ['L01.224.160.875', 'L01.296.555']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Humanities [K]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Information Science [L]']",0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,0
Substrate and inhibitor specificity of kynurenine monooxygenase from Cytophaga hutchinsonii.,"Kynurenine monooxygenase (KMO) is a potential drug target for treatment of neurodegenerative disorders such as Huntington's and Alzheimer's diseases. We have evaluated substituted kynurenines as substrates or inhibitors of KMO from Cytophaga hutchinsonii. Kynurenines substituted with a halogen at the 5-position are excellent substrates, with values of kcat and kcat/Km comparable to or higher than kynurenine. However, kynurenines substituted in the 3-position are competitive inhibitors, with KI values lower than the Km for kynurenine. Bromination also enhances inhibition, and 3,5-dibromokynurenine is a potent competitive inhibitor with a KI value of 1.5ìM. A pharmacophore model of KMO was developed, and predicted that 3,4-dichlorohippuric acid would be an inhibitor. The KI for this compound was found to be 34ìM, thus validating the pharmacophore model. We are using these results and our model to design more potent inhibitors of KMO.","['Cytophaga', 'Enzyme Inhibitors', 'Halogenation', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Kynurenine', 'Kynurenine 3-Monooxygenase', 'Models, Molecular', 'Neurodegenerative Diseases', 'Substrate Specificity']",28302400,"[['B03.440.080.130.150', 'B03.440.400.425.300.150'], ['D27.505.519.389'], ['G02.111.323', 'G03.360'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['G01.374.661', 'G02.111.490'], ['D12.125.608'], ['D08.811.682.690.708.557'], ['E05.599.595'], ['C10.574'], ['G02.111.835']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Diseases [C]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Highly fluorescent reticulocytes after CD34+ peripheral blood progenitor cell transplantation.,"Highly fluorescent reticulocyte (HFR) counts were evaluated in 13 consecutive patients affected by hematological malignancies and submitted to autologous selected CD34+ peripheral blood progenitor cell (PBPC) transplantation. Results were compared with a historical group of patients comparable for age, disease and conditioning regimen submitted to unfractionated PBPC transplantation. HFR counts of the CD34+ group declined to an undetectable level from day +4 to day +10 when they became detectable and reached 5% of total reticulocyte count by day +12. In the historical group, the nadir was identical but the recovery was faster (day +9). Total reticulocyte count > 1% was achieved at days +17 and +11, respectively. The absolute neutrophil count (ANC) recovery was identical in both groups, achieving a value > 0.5 x 10(9)/l at day +13 after reinfusion. Hence, in the historical group, HFR count gave advance notice of complete and stable hemopoietic engraftment while in the CD34+ group HFR and ANC count showed almost simultaneous recovery.","['Adult', 'Antigens, CD34', 'Female', 'Fluorescent Dyes', 'Graft Survival', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Hodgkin Disease', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma', 'Reticulocyte Count', 'Reticulocytes', 'Transplantation, Autologous']",9509969,"[['M01.060.116'], ['D23.050.301.264.035.134', 'D23.101.100.110.134'], ['D27.720.233.348', 'D27.720.470.410.505.500'], ['G12.875.545.340'], ['G04.152.825', 'G09.188.343'], ['E02.095.147.500.500.500', 'E04.936.225.687.500'], ['C04.557.386.355', 'C15.604.515.569.355', 'C20.683.515.761.355'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['G01.374.661', 'G02.111.490'], ['C04.557.386.480', 'C15.604.515.569.480', 'C20.683.515.761.480'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['C04.557.595.500', 'C14.907.454.460', 'C15.378.147.780.650', 'C15.378.463.515.460', 'C20.683.515.845', 'C20.683.780.650'], ['E01.370.225.500.195.107.330.725', 'E01.370.225.625.107.330.725', 'E05.200.500.195.107.330.725', 'E05.200.625.107.330.725', 'E05.242.195.107.330.725', 'G04.140.107.330.725', 'G09.188.105.330.725'], ['A11.118.290.760', 'A11.148.790', 'A11.443.240.665', 'A15.145.229.334.760', 'A15.378.316.790'], ['E04.936.664']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
[Gamma knife radiosurgery in neurosurgery].,"The gamma knife is a stereotactic radiosurgery device which allows well defined, deep seated brain tumors, or arteriovenous malformations having a diameter of less than 3 cm, to be treated in a single session under local anesthesia. This technique, which was first described over 40 years ago, has undergone major development in recent years and is the most commonly used method for radiosurgery worldwide. The principle relies on the over-lapping of narrow collimated beams from 201 cobalt-60 sources. The technique, which was introduced into Switzerland in September 1994, has rapidly gained recognition. 184 patients have been treated by 30 April 1997. An average follow-up period of 15 months is much too short for analysis of patients treated by radiosurgery. However, our series of benign tumors shows stabilization of volume in the first few months followed by a slow reduction of the tumor volume, in all but two cases. The gamma knife represents the treatment of choice for recurrent and unsuccessfully operated patients with endocrine active pituitary adenomas. With brain metastases, a rapid reduction in tumor volume is seen in the first few weeks in the majority of cases. The tumor volume may then remain stable or reduce further until complete disappearance. In the case of arteriovenous malformations complete obliteration of the nidus is not seen, on average, for 2-3 years. Individual patient follow-up studies illustrate these results. To date our results have shown zero morbidity and mortality. International statistics from 58,766 cases (as of December 1996) from 77 gamma knife centers demonstrate the value of this technique as a complement or, depending on the indication, an alternative to classical microsurgery.","['Anesthesia, Local', 'Arteriovenous Malformations', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Humans', 'Neurosurgery', 'Radiosurgery']",9522414,"[['E03.155.086.231'], ['C14.240.850.750', 'C14.907.150', 'C16.131.240.850.750'], ['C04.588.614.250.195', 'C10.228.140.211', 'C10.551.240.250'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['H02.403.810.425'], ['E02.815.530', 'E04.525.800.650', 'E05.873.500']]","['Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]']",0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
Efficient gene targeting by homology-directed repair in rat zygotes using TALE nucleases.,"The generation of genetically modified animals is important for both research and commercial purposes. The rat is an important model organism that until recently lacked efficient genetic engineering tools. Sequence-specific nucleases, such as ZFNs, TALE nucleases, and CRISPR/Cas9 have allowed the creation of rat knockout models. Genetic engineering by homology-directed repair (HDR) is utilized to create animals expressing transgenes in a controlled way and to introduce precise genetic modifications. We applied TALE nucleases and donor DNA microinjection into zygotes to generate HDR-modified rats with large new sequences introduced into three different loci with high efficiency (0.62%-5.13% of microinjected zygotes). Two of these loci (Rosa26 and Hprt1) are known to allow robust and reproducible transgene expression and were targeted for integration of a GFP expression cassette driven by the CAG promoter. GFP-expressing embryos and four Rosa26 GFP rat lines analyzed showed strong and widespread GFP expression in most cells of all analyzed tissues. The third targeted locus was Ighm, where we performed successful exon exchange of rat exon 2 for the human one. At all three loci we observed HDR only when using linear and not circular donor DNA. Mild hypothermic (30°C) culture of zygotes after microinjection increased HDR efficiency for some loci. Our study demonstrates that TALE nuclease and donor DNA microinjection into rat zygotes results in efficient and reproducible targeted donor integration by HDR. This allowed creation of genetically modified rats in a work-, cost-, and time-effective manner.","['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA Restriction Enzymes', 'Female', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genetic Engineering', 'Hypoxanthine Phosphoribosyltransferase', 'Male', 'Microinjections', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Rats, Transgenic', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Recombinational DNA Repair', 'Zygote']",24989021,"[['B01.050'], ['G02.111.570.080', 'G05.360.080', 'L01.453.245.667.080'], ['A11.251'], ['D08.811.150.280', 'D08.811.277.352.335.350.300', 'D08.811.277.352.355.325.300'], ['E05.393.335'], ['E05.393.420'], ['D08.811.913.400.725.450'], ['E02.319.267.530.690', 'E05.591.570'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700.750'], ['B01.050.050.136.700', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700.825'], ['D12.776.828'], ['G02.111.222.700', 'G05.219.700', 'G05.728.615.612'], ['A05.360.490.690.970', 'A11.497.497.950', 'A16.950']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
Flow cytometric sorting of paraffin-embedded tumor tissues considerably improves molecular genetic analysis.,"The characterization of genetic aberrations in paraffin-embedded tumor material is impaired by contaminating normal cells. In the present study on the genetic causes of loss of HLA expression in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), we compared the efficacy of microdissection with flow cytometric sorting of tumor cells. Single-cell suspensions from paraffin-embedded material of 5 DLBCL cases were stained for CD79a and DNA content (propidium iodide). Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) using HLA class II and chromosome 6 centromeric probes and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) analysis with 5 HLA-specific microsatellite markers were performed on microdissected and flow cytometry-sorted fractions. FISH confirmed considerable enrichment of the samples after flow cytometric sorting and disclosed tumor heterogeneity in 4 cases. Moreover, lymphomas with a so-called zebra LOH pattern in the microdissected material showed unambiguous LOH after flow cytometric sorting, revealing in 1 case a biologically relevant hemizygous deletion in the HLA region.","['Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 6', 'Dissection', 'Flow Cytometry', 'HLA Antigens', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Loss of Heterozygosity', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin', 'Paraffin Embedding']",14502796,"[['C23.550.210', 'G05.365.590.175'], ['A11.284.187.520.300.325.330', 'G05.360.162.520.300.325.330'], ['E01.370.225.998.221', 'E04.221', 'E05.200.998.221'], ['E01.370.225.500.363.342', 'E01.370.225.500.386.350', 'E05.196.712.516.600.240.350', 'E05.200.500.363.342', 'E05.200.500.386.350', 'E05.242.363.342', 'E05.242.386.350'], ['D23.050.301.500.450', 'D23.050.705.552.450'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E01.370.225.500.620.670.325.350', 'E01.370.225.750.600.670.325.350', 'E05.200.500.620.670.325.350', 'E05.200.750.600.670.325.350', 'E05.393.285.350', 'E05.393.661.475.350'], ['G05.365.590.029.530'], ['C04.557.386.480.150', 'C15.604.515.569.480.150', 'C20.683.515.761.480.150'], ['C04.557.386.480', 'C15.604.515.569.480', 'C20.683.515.761.480'], ['E01.370.225.500.620.760.440.610', 'E01.370.225.750.600.760.440.610', 'E05.200.500.620.760.440.610', 'E05.200.750.600.760.440.610']]","['Diseases [C]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

A second-generation genetic linkage map for bighead carp (Aristichthys nobilis) based on microsatellite markers.,"Bighead carp (Aristichthys nobilis) is an important aquaculture fish worldwide. Genetic linkage maps for the species were previously reported, but map resolution remained to be improved. In this study, a second-generation genetic linkage map was constructed for bighead carp through a pseudo-testcross strategy using interspecific hybrids between bighead carp and silver carp. Of the 754 microsatellites genotyped in two interspecific mapping families (with 77 progenies for each family), 659 markers were assigned to 24 linkage groups, which were equal to the chromosome numbers of the haploid genome. The consensus map spanned 1917.3 cM covering 92.8% of the estimated bighead carp genome with an average marker interval of 2.9 cM. The length of linkage groups ranged from 52.2 to 133.5 cM with an average of 79.9 cM. The number of markers per linkage group varied from 11 to 55 with an average of 27.5 per linkage group. Normality tests on interval distances of the map showed a non-normal marker distribution; however, significant correlation was found between the length of linkage group and the number of markers below the 0.01 significance level (two-tailed). The length of the female map was 1.12 times that of the male map, and the average recombination ratio of female to male was 1.10:1. Visual inspection showed that distorted markers gathered in some linkage groups and in certain regions of the male and female maps. This well-defined genetic linkage map will provide a basic framework for further genome mapping of quantitative traits, comparative mapping and marker-assisted breeding in bighead carp.","['Animals', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Crosses, Genetic', 'Cyprinidae', 'Female', 'Genetic Linkage', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genotype', 'Male', 'Microsatellite Repeats']",25040196,"[['B01.050'], ['E05.393.183'], ['E05.393.281'], ['B01.050.150.900.493.200.244'], ['G05.348'], ['D23.101.387', 'G05.695.450'], ['G05.380'], ['G02.111.570.080.708.800.500', 'G05.360.080.708.800.500', 'G05.360.340.024.850.500']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]']",0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Three-Dimensional Needle Shape Estimation in TRUS-Guided Prostate Brachytherapy Using 2-D Ultrasound Images.,"In this paper, we propose an automated method to reconstruct the three-dimensional (3-D) needle shape during needle insertion procedures using only 2-D transverse ultrasound (US) images. Using a set of transverse US images, image processing and random sample consensus are used to locate the needle within each image and estimate the needle shape. The method is validated with an in vitro needle insertion setup and a transparent tissue phantom, where two orthogonal cameras are used to capture the true 3-D needle shape for verification. Results showed that the use of at least three images obtained at 75% of the maximum insertion depth or greater allows for maximum needle shape estimation errors of less than 2 mm. In addition, the needle shape can be calculated consistently as long as the needle can be identified in 30% of the transverse US images obtained. Application to permanent prostate brachytherapy is also presented, where the estimated needle shape is compared to manual segmentation and sagittal US images. Our method is intended to help to assess needle placement during manual or robot-assisted needle insertion procedures after the needle has been inserted.","['Brachytherapy', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Needles', 'Phantoms, Imaging', 'Prostate', 'Prostatic Neoplasms', 'Ultrasonography, Interventional']",26372660,"[['E02.815.150'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E07.612'], ['E07.671'], ['A05.360.444.575', 'A10.336.707'], ['C04.588.945.440.770', 'C12.294.260.750', 'C12.294.565.625', 'C12.758.409.750'], ['E01.370.350.850.855', 'E04.502.890']]","['Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Diseases [C]']",1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
"BX795, a TBK1 inhibitor, exhibits antitumor activity in human oral squamous cell carcinoma through apoptosis induction and mitotic phase arrest.","TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1), a member of IêB Kinase (IKK)-related kinases, plays a role in regulating innate immunity, inflammation and oncogenic signaling. This study aims to investigate the role of BX795, an inhibitor of TBK1, in a panel of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) cell lines. The antitumor effects and mechanisms of BX795 were assessed by MTT assays, flow cytometry, Western blotting, and confocal microscopy. BX795 exhibited a dose-responsive antiproliferative effect on OSCC cells with relative sparing of normal human oral keratinocytes. The compound caused apoptosis as evidenced by PARP cleavage, the presence of pyknotic nuclei in the TUNEL assay, and fragmented DNA tails in the Comet assay. BX795 inhibits Akt and NF-êB signaling, arrests cells in the mitotic phase, and increases generation of autophagy in oral cancer cells. Interestingly, the antiproliferative activity of BX795 does not correlate with TBK1 protein expression level in OSCC cells. We propose that the TBK1-independet effect is related to mitotic phase arrest. Pleiotropic anticancer activity with relative sparing of normal oral keratinocytes underscores the potential value of BX795 and warrants its further study in oral squamous cell carcinoma therapy.","['Antineoplastic Agents', 'Apoptosis', 'Autophagy', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoints', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Survival', 'Humans', 'I-kappa B Kinase', 'Mitosis', 'Mouth Neoplasms', 'Phosphoproteins', 'Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'Pyrimidines', 'Signal Transduction', 'Thiophenes']",26607461,"[['D27.505.954.248'], ['G04.146.954.035'], ['G04.011'], ['C04.557.470.200.400', 'C04.557.470.700.400'], ['G04.144.109'], ['A11.251.210.190', 'A11.251.860.180'], ['G04.161.750', 'G07.345.249.410.750'], ['G04.346'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D08.811.913.696.620.682.700.494', 'D12.644.360.361', 'D12.776.476.378'], ['G04.144.220.220.781', 'G05.113.220.781'], ['C04.588.443.591', 'C07.465.530'], ['D12.776.744'], ['D08.811.913.696.620.682.700'], ['D08.811.913.696.620.682.700.755', 'D12.776.476.565', 'D12.776.624.664.700.168'], ['D03.383.742'], ['G02.111.820', 'G04.835'], ['D02.886.778', 'D03.383.903']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Organisms [B]']",1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
The antigen-binding capacity of serum IgG. An immunosorbent method applied to subtilisin as antigen.,"A method for estimating the antigen-binding capacity of serum IgG is presented. A Sepharose anti-human IgG immunosorbent is incubated with test serum and washed. The antigen-binding capacity of the bound specific IgG is determined by incubation with purified, inactivated 125I-subtilisin. The method was applied tp the sera of workers in the detergent industry exposed to enzymatic preparations from Bacillus subtilis. The sera of 33 out of 69 workers bound a detectable amount of subtilisin, the detection limit ranging from 8--34 ng/ml in different assays. The amount of antigen bound ranged from 42--9380 ng/ml. IgG to subtilisin was not detected in the sera of 61 subjects with no known exposure to subtilisin and who were not factory workers.","['Absorption', 'Antibody Specificity', 'Binding Sites, Antibody', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin G', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Iodine Radioisotopes', 'Occupational Medicine', 'Subtilisins', 'Time Factors']",1270812,"[['G01.015', 'G02.010', 'G03.015', 'G03.787.024', 'G07.690.725.015'], ['G12.100'], ['G02.111.570.060.425.079', 'G02.111.570.120.408', 'G12.122.232', 'G12.125'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D12.776.124.486.485.114.619.393', 'D12.776.124.790.651.114.619.393', 'D12.776.377.715.548.114.619.393'], ['E05.481'], ['D01.268.380.400.500.496', 'D01.496.448.496', 'D01.496.749.474'], ['H02.403.720.750.510'], ['D08.811.277.656.300.760.787', 'D08.811.277.656.959.350.787'], ['G01.910.857']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]']",0,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
Comparison of the effects of endothelin-1 and endothelin-3 on the rat stomach.,"The effects of systemic administration of endothelin-1 and endothelin-3 on the susceptibility of the stomach to injury were compared in the anesthetized rat, as were their effects on gastric vascular tone, systemic blood pressure and hematocrit. When infused at concentrations in the 10(-7)-10(-6) M range, endothelin-1 was a far more potent hypertensive agent than endothelin-3. Endothelin-1 caused significant hemoconcentration, while endothelin-3 did not Endothelin-1 was approximately 5- to 10-times more potent as a vasoconstrictor in the stomach and a similar difference in potencies was observed when the ability of these peptides to increase the susceptibility of the stomach to ethanol-induced damage was compared. The two peptides were equipotent in producing gastric mucosal hemorrhage in the absence of any exogenous irritant. These results demonstrate that like endothelin-1, endothelin-3 has ulcerogenic and vasoconstriction actions in the stomach. While there are very large differences in the potencies of the two peptides in terms of producing systemic hypertension and hemoconcentration, the differences in the potency of the gastric ulcerogenic and vasoconstrictor effects are much less marked.","['Animals', 'Blood Pressure', 'Endothelins', 'Endothelium, Vascular', 'Ethanol', 'Gastric Mucosa', 'Hematocrit', 'Male', 'Peptides', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred Strains', 'Stomach', 'Stomach Ulcer', 'Vasoconstriction']",2673803,"[['B01.050'], ['E01.370.600.875.249', 'G09.330.380.076'], ['D12.644.276.400', 'D12.776.467.400', 'D23.529.400'], ['A07.015.700.500', 'A10.272.491.355'], ['D02.033.375'], ['A03.556.875.875.440', 'A10.615.550.291'], ['E01.370.225.625.400', 'E05.200.625.400', 'G09.188.370.374'], ['D12.644'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700'], ['B01.050.050.199.520.760', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700.400'], ['A03.556.875.875'], ['C06.405.469.275.800.849', 'C06.405.748.586.849'], ['G09.330.380.925']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Diseases [C]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Experiments with a biological material for the closure of incisional hernias.,"A new preparation process was studied which should allow the implantation of collagen type I in its native structure in reconstructive surgery, in this special case for closure of incisional hernias. As experimental animals we used 30 female Lewis rats. A defect of the anterior abdominal wall measuring 3 cm X 4 cm was closed with our collagen substitute. Biopsies taken after 4, 6 and 8 weeks were examined morphologically. As criteria for revitalization and revascularization we used the type of infiltrating cells, the depth and density of infiltration and the formation of new blood vessels. After 4 weeks the implants were infiltrated by fibroblasts that decreased in density towards the centre. Good revascularization could be seen on the muscle-implant interface. After 6 weeks the density of infiltrating cells had increased markedly even to the centre of the collagen implant. Sporadically small vessels could be seen. Eight weeks after implantation the density of infiltrated cells was at the same high level, and capillary bundles could be seen within the whole implant. We believe that this collagen implant is suitable for the closure of hernias as shown by its physical and morphological properties. In particular it appears to guarantee and earlier and tighter closure of hernias than other materials.","['Animals', 'Biocompatible Materials', 'Collagen', 'Female', 'Hernia, Ventral', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred Lew', 'Rats, Inbred Strains']",3498092,"[['B01.050'], ['D25.130', 'D27.720.102.130', 'J01.637.051.130'], ['D05.750.078.280', 'D12.776.860.300.250'], ['C23.300.707.374.937'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700'], ['B01.050.050.199.520.760.280', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700.400.280'], ['B01.050.050.199.520.760', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700.400']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]', 'Diseases [C]']",0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
Intracranial hyperthermia through local photothermal heating with a fiberoptic microneedle device.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The fiberoptic microneedle device (FMD) seeks to leverage advantages of both laser-induced thermal therapy (LITT) and convection-enhanced delivery (CED) to increase volumetric dispersal of locally infused chemotherapeutics through sub-lethal photothermal heat generation. This study focused on determination of photothermal damage thresholds with 1,064 nm light delivered through the FMD into in vivo rat models.MATERIALS AND METHODS: FMDs capable of co-delivering laser energy and fluid agents were fabricated through a novel off-center splicing technique involving fusion of a multimode fiberoptic to light-guiding capillary tubing. FMDs were positioned at a depth of 2.5 mm within the cerebrum of male rats with fluoroptic temperature probes placed within 1 mm of the FMD tip. Irradiation (without fluid infusion) was conducted at laser powers of 0 (sham), 100, 200, 500, or 750 mW. Evans blue-serum albumin conjugated complex solution (EBA) and laser energy co-delivery were performed in a second set of preliminary experiments.RESULTS: Maximum, steady-state temperatures of 38.7 ± 1.6 and 42.0 ± 0.9 °C were measured for the 100 and 200 mW experimental groups, respectively. Histological investigation demonstrated needle insertion damage alone for sham and 100 mW irradiations. Photothermal damage was detected at 200 mW, although observable thermal damage was limited to a small penumbra of cerebral cortical microcavitation and necrosis that immediately surrounded the region of FMD insertion. Co-delivery of EBA and laser energy presented increased volumetric dispersal relative to infusion-only controls.CONCLUSION: Fluoroptic temperature sensing and histopathological assessments demonstrated that a laser power of 100 mW results in sub-lethal brain hyperthermia, and the optimum, sub-lethal target energy range is likely 100-200 mW. The preliminary FMD-CED experiments confirmed the feasibility of augmenting fluid dispersal using slight photothermal heat generation, demonstrating the FMD's potential as a way to increase the efficacy of CED in treating MG.","['Animals', 'Body Temperature', 'Cerebrum', 'Evans Blue', 'Hyperthermia, Induced', 'Lasers', 'Male', 'Necrosis', 'Needles', 'Optical Fibers', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred F344', 'Serum Albumin']",23390044,"[['B01.050'], ['E01.370.600.875.374', 'G07.110'], ['A08.186.211.200.885.287'], ['D02.172.560', 'D02.455.426.559.847.638.555.400', 'D02.886.645.600.080.050.650.300', 'D04.615.638.555.400'], ['E02.565'], ['E07.632.490', 'E07.710.520'], ['C23.550.717'], ['E07.612'], ['E07.632.750'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700'], ['B01.050.050.199.520.760.200', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700.400.200'], ['D12.776.034.841', 'D12.776.124.727']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Diseases [C]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Suction fixation system for stereotactic radiosurgery of intraocular malignancies.,"We designed a suction fixation system for the radiosurgical treatment of intraocular malignancies with the Leksell gamma unit (gamma knife). OUr device consists of a circular suction chamber and an adjustable unit to be fixed to the Leksell stereotactic head frame. All components are made of plastic materials in order to avoid artifacts in CT or MRT imaging. A permanent suction of 600 to 800 millibars is provided by a standard vacuum pump, powered by a portable battery. Suction times up to 40 minutes were well tolerated in all cases. In the gamma knife of the Neurosurgical Department at the University of Vienna, we successfully used this device. Up to January 1994 we have performed 19 radiosurgical treatments in 9 patients with large or extra-large uveal melanomas and in one patient suffering from a choroidal metastasis.","['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Choroid Neoplasms', 'Ciliary Body', 'Equipment Design', 'Eye Neoplasms', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Male', 'Melanoma', 'Neoplasms, Unknown Primary', 'Radiosurgery', 'Suction', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Uveal Neoplasms']",7502720,"[['M01.060.116.100'], ['M01.060.116.100.080'], ['C04.588.364.978.223', 'C11.319.494.198', 'C11.941.160.238', 'C11.941.855.198'], ['A09.371.060.160', 'A09.371.894.280'], ['E05.320'], ['C04.588.364', 'C11.319'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E01.370.350.825.500'], ['C04.557.465.625.650.510', 'C04.557.580.625.650.510', 'C04.557.665.510'], ['C04.697.650.895', 'C23.550.727.650.895'], ['E02.815.530', 'E04.525.800.650', 'E05.873.500'], ['E04.237.890'], ['E01.370.350.350.810', 'E01.370.350.600.350.700.810', 'E01.370.350.700.700.810', 'E01.370.350.700.810.810', 'E01.370.350.825.810.810'], ['E01.789.800', 'N04.761.559.590.800', 'N05.715.360.575.575.800'], ['C04.588.364.978', 'C11.319.494', 'C11.941.855']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Health Care [N]']",1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
Spontaneous True Gastroduodenal Artery Aneurysm Rupture after an Inguinal Hernia Operation.,"Gastroduodenal artery aneurysms are a very rare subtype of visceral artery aneurysms. These are divided into two groups as true and pseudoaneurysms. Pseudogastroduodenal artery aneurysms, which develops secondary to pancreatitis, is seen more frequently, whereas the true aneurysms are much less common. Spontaneous rupture may be fatal. Sudden onset of abdominal pain and hypotension are the most important clinical findings. Endovascular interventions are the gold standard for diagnosis. Regardless of their sizes, GDA aneurysms should be treated as soon as possible. In patients diagnosed with gastroduodenal artery aneurysm rupture, endovascular embolization is recommended if the hemodynamics is stable and surgical treatment, if not. Aneurysm ruptures, especially from the GDA divisions, are deeply localized in the pancreas parenchyma and are difficult to detect during the operation. In such cases, the earliest postoperative diagnosis with endovascular intervention and applying embolization are life-saving.

Circadian control of innate immunity in macrophages by miR-155 targeting Bmal1.,"The response to an innate immune challenge is conditioned by the time of day, but the molecular basis for this remains unclear. In myeloid cells, there is a temporal regulation to induction by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) of the proinflammatory microRNA miR-155 that correlates inversely with levels of BMAL1. BMAL1 in the myeloid lineage inhibits activation of NF-êB and miR-155 induction and protects mice from LPS-induced sepsis. Bmal1 has two miR-155-binding sites in its 3'-UTR, and, in response to LPS, miR-155 binds to these two target sites, leading to suppression of Bmal1 mRNA and protein in mice and humans. miR-155 deletion perturbs circadian function, gives rise to a shorter circadian day, and ablates the circadian effect on cytokine responses to LPS. Thus, the molecular clock controls miR-155 induction that can repress BMAL1 directly. This leads to an innate immune response that is variably responsive to challenges across the circadian day.","[""3' Untranslated Regions"", 'ARNTL Transcription Factors', 'Adipose Tissue', 'Animals', 'Circadian Rhythm', 'Cytokines', 'Immunity, Innate', 'Macrophages', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'MicroRNAs', 'NF-kappa B']",25995365,"[['D13.444.735.544.875.880', 'D13.444.735.790.878.880', 'G05.360.340.024.220.880.880', 'G05.360.340.024.340.137.910.880'], ['D12.644.360.138.049', 'D12.776.260.103.249', 'D12.776.476.156.100', 'D12.776.930.125.249'], ['A10.165.114'], ['B01.050'], ['G07.180.562.190'], ['D12.644.276.374', 'D12.776.467.374', 'D23.529.374'], ['G12.450.564'], ['A11.329.372', 'A11.627.482', 'A11.733.397', 'A15.382.670.522', 'A15.382.680.397'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500'], ['B01.050.050.136.500.500', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500.550.455', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500.800.500'], ['D13.150.650.319', 'D13.444.735.150.319', 'D13.444.735.790.552.500'], ['D05.500.672', 'D12.776.260.600', 'D12.776.660.600', 'D12.776.930.600']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Organisms [B]']",1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
"[Neonatal chylothorax: aetiology, clinical course and efficacy of treatment].","OBJECTIVES: To investigate the aetiology, clinical course and response to treatment of neonatal chylothorax.PATIENTS AND METHOD: Prospective study over a 2-year period in a neonatal intensive care unit of a tertiary university hospital. All newborns followed a predefined therapeutic protocol that included the sequential administration of total parenteral nutrition (TPN), octreotide and surgery. The influence of aetiology on outcome and response to treatment was investigated.RESULTS: The study included 22 newborns. Surgery for congenital heart disease (CHD) (n = 14) and congenital diaphragmatic hernia (n = 4) were the most common aetiologies. The incidence of chylothorax in these aetiological groups was 11.2 % (95 % CI 5.7-16.8 %) and 26.6 % (95 % CI 4.3-40 %), respectively. Medical treatment was successful in 17 patients. Five of the 10 patients who did not respond to TPN were successfully treated with octreotide; none of the patients in whom octreotide failed responded to the subsequent 3 weeks of TPN. No side-effects were observed during octreotide administration. No significant association between aetiology and response to treatment was found, although all 4 patients who ultimately required surgery were in the CHD group. All patients had complications attributable to chylothorax. Five patients died during the 6 months of follow-up although mortality was never directly attributed to chylothorax.CONCLUSIONS: Most patients can be successfully managed with medical treatment but early surgery should be considered in patients who do not respond to medical treatment. Aetiology is the main determinant of mortality. Randomized controlled studies are needed to demonstrate the efficacy and adequate timing of application of each therapeutic intervention.","['Algorithms', 'Chylothorax', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Gastrointestinal Agents', 'Gestational Age', 'Humans', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Injections, Intravenous', 'Octreotide', 'Prospective Studies', 'Suction']",18358132,"[['G17.035', 'L01.224.050'], ['C08.528.142'], ['E02.186'], ['D27.505.954.483'], ['G07.345.500.325.235.968', 'G08.686.320'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.703.520'], ['E02.319.267.082.750', 'E02.319.267.530.540'], ['D04.345.566.650', 'D12.644.641.650'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.625', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.650', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.650'], ['E04.237.890']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Health Care [N]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0
[Determination of 8-methoxypsoralen in mouse plasma by high performance liquid chromatography and its application to pharmacokinetic study].,"OBJECTIVE: To establish a high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method for the determination of 8-methoxypsoralen (8-MOP) in mouse plasma and apply it to a pharmacokinetic study of 8-MOP.METHODS: 8-MOP was separated on a Waters Symmetry18 column (250 mm ? 4.6 mm, 5 ìm) and determined by HPLC using isocratic elution, and 5-methoxypsoralen was used as internal standard. The mobile phase consisted of methanol-water (55:45, V/V) at a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min. The excitation and emission wavelength of fluorescence detector were set at 334 nm and 484 nm respectively, and the internal standard method was used for quantitative analysis. In the study, 60 healthy ICR male mice were randomly divided into twelve groups. The mice in control group were administered intragastrically with 1% Tween 80, and the mice in the other eleven groups were administered intragastrically with 8-MOP (40 mg/kg). Plasma concentrations of 8-MOP in the mice at different time points after treatment were determined by HPLC. Pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated by DAS 2.0 software.RESULTS: The calibration curve of 8-MOP was linear with a correlation coefficient of 0.999 3 over the concentration range of 0.05 to 10 mg/L, and the limit of detection was 0.015 mg/L. The average recoveries of 8? MOP at three different concentrations (0.10, 0.50, 2.5 mg/L) were from 92.5% to 100.6%. The intra-day precision of 8-MOP was from 3.3% to 8.2%, while the inter-day precision was from 3.4% to 6.7% at three spiked concentration levels. The extraction recoveries of 8-MOP were from 90.9% to 92.0%, and the plasma samples could be stored at -80°C for 15 days at least at three spiked concentration levels. 8-MOP could be detected in mouse plasma 5 min after intragastrical administration to the mice (1.4 mg/L). The concentration of 8-MOP in the mouse plasma reached a maximum 2 h after administration, and 8-MOP could still be detected 24 h after administration (1.1 mg/L). t1/2 was (39.21±3.65) h, Cmax was (2.31±0.02) mg/L, tmax was (2.00±0.00) h, and AUC0-t was (33.34±1.19) (h?mg)/L.CONCLUSION: The proposed method is accurate and simple,suitable for pharmacokinetics of 8-MOP in mice.","['Animals', 'Calibration', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Male', 'Methoxsalen', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred ICR', 'Photosensitizing Agents', 'Plasma', 'Random Allocation']",30337737,"[['B01.050'], ['E05.978.155'], ['E05.196.181.400.300'], ['D03.383.663.283.446.794.500', 'D03.633.100.150.446.794.500', 'D03.633.300.770.500'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500'], ['B01.050.050.199.520.520.510', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500.400.510'], ['D27.505.954.444.600', 'D27.505.954.600.710'], ['A12.207.152.693', 'A12.207.270.695', 'A15.145.693'], ['E05.318.370.700', 'E05.581.500.805', 'N05.715.360.325.675', 'N06.850.520.445.700']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Health Care [N]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
Enhancement of LPS-induced microglial inflammation response via TLR4 under high glucose conditions.,"BACKGROUND: Microglia activation mediated by toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) plays an important role in neuroinflammation and postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD). Diabetes mellitus (DM) has been recently suggested as an independent risk factor for POCD. In this study, we investigate the potential exacerbation of the inflammatory response in primary microglia due to high glucose conditions.METHODS: Primary microglial cells were exposed to normal glucose (25 mmol/L) and high glucose (35 mmol/L) levels alone or with lipopolyscaccharide (LPS 0, 2, 5, 10 ng/mL). The pro-inflammatory response of the cells was assessed by measuring changes in cytokine levels and the evaluation of associated signaling pathways.RESULTS: Neither high glucose nor low LPS (?5 ng/ml) alone had an effect on TNF-a and IL-6 levels, but the combination of low LPS and high glucose stimulated the inflammatory response. Analyses of the associated signaling pathways demonstrated that high glucose enhanced the LPS-induced microglial activation via the TLR4/JAK2/STAT3 pathway.CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that high glucose, one of the key abnormalities characteristic of DM, can augment LPS-induced microglial activation and inflammatory cytokine levels through the TLR4/JAK2/STAT3 pathway, offering new insight into the pathophysiological relationship between DM and POCD.","['Animals', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Glucose', 'Inflammation', 'Interleukin-6', 'Janus Kinase 2', 'Lipopolysaccharides', 'Microglia', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor', 'Signal Transduction', 'Toll-Like Receptor 4', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha']",25790769,"[['B01.050'], ['A11.251'], ['D09.947.875.359.448'], ['C23.550.470'], ['D12.644.276.374.465.224', 'D12.776.467.374.465.202', 'D23.529.374.465.224'], ['D08.811.913.696.620.682.725.124.200', 'D12.776.476.393.200', 'D12.776.624.664.700.117'], ['D09.400.500', 'D09.698.718.450', 'D10.494', 'D23.050.161.616.525', 'D23.946.123.329.500'], ['A08.637.400', 'A11.650.400'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700.750'], ['D12.644.360.024.342.300', 'D12.776.157.057.186.300', 'D12.776.476.024.430.300', 'D12.776.930.840.300'], ['G02.111.820', 'G04.835'], ['D12.776.543.750.705.910.500.400'], ['D12.644.276.374.500.800', 'D12.644.276.374.750.626', 'D12.776.124.900', 'D12.776.395.930', 'D12.776.467.374.500.800', 'D12.776.467.374.750.626', 'D23.529.374.500.800', 'D23.529.374.750.626']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Immunology in diabetic pregnancy: activated T cells in diabetic mothers and neonates.,"Lymphocytes bearing surface antigens indicating early and full activation have been evaluated, in addition to T cell subsets, in blood samples from diabetic pregnant patients, neonates from diabetic mothers and control groups. The type of diabetes and the trimester of pregnancy were taken into account. Monoclonal antibodies were used to enumerate total T cells, helper/inducer, cytotoxic/suppressor Tlymphocytes and activated mononuclear cells using antibodies binding lymphocyte surface antigens as markers of early lymphocyte activation, and MHC Class II surface antigens as markers of late activation. A decrease in T-helper cells during the third trimester of pregnancy in Type 1 (insulin-dependent) and gestational diabetic patients (p less than 0.02) and a decrease in T-suppressor cells in Type 2 (non-insulin-dependent) diabetic pregnant patients during the third trimester (p less than 0.01) were observed in relation to normal values. As in normal pregnancy, 4F2-positive cells were increased in 48% of diabetic pregnant patients during the second and third trimesters of gestation. Class II-positive cells were increased in almost 60% of Type 1 and gestational diabetic patients during the last trimester of pregnancy in comparison with normal pregnant women and control subjects. A decrease in T-helper cells (p less than 0.02) and a clear increase in 4F2-positive cells (p less than 0.001) and Class II-positive lymphocytes (p less than 0.005) were observed in the infants of diabetic mothers in comparison with control subjects. The maternal cellular immune system, actively altered in pregnancy, is fully activated in a number of Type 1 and gestational diabetic pregnant patients. Activated lymphocytes are even found in the neonates of diabetic mothers, but these do not trigger the events leading to the onset of diabetes in the short term.","['Adult', 'Antigens, Surface', 'Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1', 'Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy in Diabetics', 'T-Lymphocytes']",3494642,"[['M01.060.116'], ['D23.050.301'], ['C18.452.394.750.124', 'C19.246.267', 'C20.111.327'], ['C18.452.394.750.149', 'C19.246.300'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.703.520'], ['E01.370.225.812.482', 'E05.200.812.482', 'E05.478.594.530', 'G12.450.050.400.545', 'G12.565'], ['G08.686.784.769'], ['C13.703.726'], ['A11.118.637.555.567.569', 'A15.145.229.637.555.567.569', 'A15.382.490.555.567.569']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
Mitochondrial oxidative stress causes chromosomal instability of mouse embryonic fibroblasts.,"Reactive oxygen species are an inevitable by-product of mitochondrial respiration. It has been estimated that between 0.4 and 4% of molecular oxygen is converted to the radical superoxide (O2*-) and this level is significantly influenced by the functional status of the mitochondria. It is well established that exogenous oxidative stress and high doses of mitochondrial poisons such as paraquat and carbonyl cyanide 4 (trifluoromethoxy) phenylhydrazone (FCCP) can lead to genomic instability. In this report we show for the first time that endogenous mitochondrial oxidative stress in standard cell culture conditions results in nuclear genomic instability in primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). We show that lack of mitochondrial superoxide dismutase in MEFs leads to a severe increase of double strand breaks, end-to-end fusions, chromosomal translocations, and loss of cell viability and proliferative capacity. Our results predict that endogenous mitochondrial oxidative stress can induce genomic instability, and therefore may have a profound effect in cancer and aging.","['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspases', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chromosomal Instability', 'Embryo, Mammalian', 'Female', 'Fibroblasts', 'Mice', 'Mitochondria', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Oxygen', 'Pregnancy', 'Superoxide Dismutase', 'Translocation, Genetic']",14570235,"[['B01.050'], ['G04.146.954.035'], ['D08.811.277.656.262.500.126.350.300', 'D08.811.277.656.300.200.126.350.300', 'D12.644.360.075.405.350.300', 'D12.776.476.075.405.350.300'], ['D08.811.277.656.262.500.126', 'D08.811.277.656.300.200.126', 'D12.644.360.075.405', 'D12.776.476.075.405'], ['G04.144.220', 'G04.161.750.500', 'G05.113', 'G07.345.249.410.750.500'], ['C04.697.098.500', 'C23.550.727.098.500'], ['A11.251'], ['C23.550.210.110', 'C23.550.362.180', 'G05.365.590.175.165', 'G05.370.180'], ['A16.254'], ['A11.329.228'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500'], ['A11.284.430.214.190.875.564', 'A11.284.835.626'], ['G03.673', 'G07.775.750'], ['D01.268.185.550', 'D01.362.670'], ['G08.686.784.769'], ['D08.811.682.881'], ['C23.550.210.870', 'G05.365.590.175.870', 'G05.558.860']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Accuracy and the effect of possible subject-based confounders of magnitude-based MRI for estimating hepatic proton density fat fraction in adults, using MR spectroscopy as reference.","PURPOSE: To determine the accuracy and the effect of possible subject-based confounders of magnitude-based magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for estimating hepatic proton density fat fraction (PDFF) for different numbers of echoes in adults with known or suspected nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, using MR spectroscopy (MRS) as a reference.MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this retrospective analysis of 506 adults, hepatic PDFF was estimated by unenhanced 3.0T MRI, using right-lobe MRS as reference. Regions of interest placed on source images and on six-echo parametric PDFF maps were colocalized to MRS voxel location. Accuracy using different numbers of echoes was assessed by regression and Bland-Altman analysis; slope, intercept, average bias, and R2 were calculated. The effect of age, sex, and body mass index (BMI) on hepatic PDFF accuracy was investigated using multivariate linear regression analyses.RESULTS: MRI closely agreed with MRS for all tested methods. For three- to six-echo methods, slope, regression intercept, average bias, and R2 were 1.01-0.99, 0.11-0.62%, 0.24-0.56%, and 0.981-0.982, respectively. Slope was closest to unity for the five-echo method. The two-echo method was least accurate, underestimating PDFF by an average of 2.93%, compared to an average of 0.23-0.69% for the other methods. Statistically significant but clinically nonmeaningful effects on PDFF error were found for subject BMI (P range: 0.0016 to 0.0783), male sex (P range: 0.015 to 0.037), and no statistically significant effect was found for subject age (P range: 0.18-0.24).CONCLUSION: Hepatic magnitude-based MRI PDFF estimates using three, four, five, and six echoes, and six-echo parametric maps are accurate compared to reference MRS values, and that accuracy is not meaningfully confounded by age, sex, or BMI.","['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Liver', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Young Adult']",26201284,"[['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['M01.060.116.100.080'], ['E05.318.372.500.875', 'N05.715.360.330.500.875', 'N06.850.520.450.500.875'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['A03.620'], ['E01.370.350.825.500'], ['E05.196.867.519'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['C06.552.241.519'], ['E05.318.370.725', 'E05.337.851', 'N05.715.360.325.685', 'N06.850.520.445.725'], ['E05.318.372.500.500.500', 'E05.318.372.500.750.750', 'N05.715.360.330.500.500.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.825', 'N06.850.520.450.500.500.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.825'], ['M01.060.116.815']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Diseases [C]']",1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
[Determination of the overall migration of chemicals from the plastic packaging into the aqueous models of food using the EU methods].,"Overall migration from food plastic packaging to aquatic food simulants (distilled water, 3% acetic acid) was determined according to the EU methods. Testing conditions (time and temperature) reflected normal use of tested food packaging. The overall migration studies using different food simulants (distilled water, 3% acetic acid) shows that the migration rate was very low, far below the allowed limit (10 mg/dm2). The high results of overall migration into 3% acetic acid (average 250.2 mg/dm2), markedly exceeding the allowed limit, was found in the case of multilayer film. It means that the multilayer film tested does not comply with the migration limit and it can not be used as a food packaging for the sour foodstuffs of pH below 4.5. Differences between the magnitude of overall migration into distilled water (0.5-1.1 mg/dm2) and 3% acetic acid are probably due to the presence of easy washable substances into the sour medium. From that reason the application of such food packaging materials must be limited.","['Acetic Acid', 'European Union', 'Food Additives', 'Food Contamination', 'Food Packaging', 'Food Preservation', 'Humans', 'Plastics', 'Poland', 'Sodium Chloride', 'Water']",15307610,"[['D02.241.081.018.165', 'D10.251.400.045.500'], ['I01.615.500.475'], ['D27.720.372.300', 'G07.203.300.514.500', 'J02.500.514.500'], ['J01.576.423.850.730.500.249', 'N06.850.460.400', 'N06.850.601.500.249'], ['J01.576.423.200.375', 'J01.576.423.850.600', 'J01.576.761.400'], ['J01.576.423.850.700'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D05.750.716', 'D25.720.716', 'J01.637.051.720.716'], ['Z01.542.248.679'], ['D01.210.450.150.875', 'D01.857.650'], ['D01.045.250.875', 'D01.248.497.158.459.650', 'D01.650.550.925']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Geographicals [Z]']",0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,1
Progressive resistive exercise in weaning high quadriplegics from the ventilator.,"Acutely high level quadriplegics may experience neuromuscular respiratory insufficiency secondary to loss of use of intercostal and abdominal muscles as well as partial involvement of the phrenic nerve. Frequently, these patients will require mechanical ventilation in the initial stages of their treatment. These patients may present difficulty with weaning off the ventilator. In addition, poor respiratory reserve increases the risk of episodic decompensation. We have instituted a progressive resistive exercise protocol (PRE) analogous to PRE commonly used in training skeletal muscle, to wean patients off the ventilator. This involves determining the patient's endurance to the development of fatigue while off the ventilator. Patients are re-evaluated weekly until they are weaned from the ventilator. Three case studies are reported in which this protocol was used. In addition to our standard respiratory therapy and physical therapy protocols, values for vital capacity and maximum inspiratory force at admission and post-weaning were recorded. After completion of the programme, none of the patients required re-intubation or subsequent mechanical ventilation. This method of diaphragm training may be useful in weaning high level quadriplegics from the ventilator.","['Adult', 'Breathing Exercises', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Quadriplegia', 'Respiration, Artificial', 'Respiratory Paralysis', 'Respiratory Therapy']",3588008,"[['M01.060.116'], ['E02.190.525.186', 'E02.779.474.124'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['C10.597.622.760', 'C23.888.592.636.786'], ['E02.041.625', 'E02.365.647.729', 'E02.880.820'], ['C08.618.846.812', 'C10.597.622.812', 'C23.888.592.636.812'], ['E02.880']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]']",0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
Foot-and-mouth disease virus protease 3C inhibits cellular transcription and mediates cleavage of histone H3.,"Foot-and-mouth disease virus protease 3C is essential for the processing of the viral precursor polyprotein. It is shown here to also inhibit gene expression in baby hamster kidney cells after transient expression from transfected cDNA fragments. Protease 3C could not be detected by indirect immunofluorescence in contrast to other cDNA-encoded virus proteins, but protein synthesized de novo 16 hr after transfection could be detected by radioimmunoprecipitation. The cellular translation apparatus was, therefore, not inhibited. The enzyme, although produced as part of a fusion protein, was in size indistinguishable from that found in virus-infected cells. This suggested that the enzyme was released by autocatalysis from the recombinant fusion protein and from viral precursor protein in a similar manner. Transcription of protease 3C-encoding cDNA fragments as well as that of cotransfected fragments, which do not encode protease 3C, was inhibited as determined by hybridization assays. The shut off of transcription which was one of the cytopathic effects observed in virus-infected cells therefore correlates with the production of transactive protease 3C. The inhibitory molecular mechanism may involve truncation of the nuclear protein histone H3 at its N-terminus since this protein was found similarly truncated in virus-infected cells and after transfer of 3C-encoding cDNA fragments.","['Animals', 'Aphthovirus', 'Cricetinae', 'DNA', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Gene Expression', 'Histones', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'Peptide Hydrolases', 'Precipitin Tests', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transfection']",2154880,"[['B01.050'], ['B04.820.578.750.070'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.075.250'], ['D13.444.308'], ['E01.370.225.500.607.512.240', 'E01.370.225.750.551.512.240', 'E05.200.500.607.512.240', 'E05.200.750.551.512.240', 'E05.478.583.375'], ['G05.297'], ['D12.776.157.687.485', 'D12.776.660.720.485', 'D12.776.664.469'], ['E05.393.661', 'G02.111.611'], ['D08.811.277.656'], ['E01.370.225.812.735.645', 'E05.196.150.639.500', 'E05.200.812.735.645', 'E05.478.594.760.645', 'E05.478.605.492'], ['G02.111.873', 'G05.297.700'], ['E05.393.350.810', 'G05.728.860']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Anatomic considerations of anterior instrumentation of the thoracic spine.,"Forty-seven dry thoracic specimens from T-3 to T-12 (470 thoracic vertebrae) were used to measure the dimensions of the vertebral body of the thoracic spine and to determine the relationship of the posterior angulation of screw placement to the spinal canal from different entrance points. Statistically significant differences in dimensions of male and female specimens were found in the anterior vertebral body height and all of the angular measurements. The average maximum posterior angle relative to the frontal plane from T-3 to T-12 for both sexes ranged from 11 degrees to 14 degrees at the initial point (the level of the most anterior edge of the upper costal facet), from 20 degrees to 23 degrees at the point of 5 mm anterior to the initial point, and from 30 degrees to 34 degrees at the point of 10 mm anterior to the initial point. This study suggests that there is considerable risk of violating the spinal canal if the screws are inadvertently angled posteriorly. The authors recommend insertion of screws in the anterior or middle part of the lateral aspect of the vertebral body. The screws should be directed perpendicular to the lateral plane of the vertebral body. A posteriorly placed screw should be directed anteriorly.","['Adult', 'Aged', 'Bone Screws', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Sex Factors', 'Spinal Fusion', 'Thoracic Vertebrae']",9193696,"[['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['E07.695.370.437', 'E07.858.442.660.460.437', 'E07.858.690.725.460.437'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['N05.715.350.675', 'N06.850.490.875'], ['E04.555.100.700'], ['A02.835.232.834.892']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
Participation in Cancer Pharmacogenomic Studies: A Study of 8456 Patients Registered to Clinical Trials in the Cancer and Leukemia Group B (Alliance).,"BACKGROUND: Clinically annotated specimens from cancer clinical trial participants offer an opportunity for discovery and validation of pharmacogenomic findings. The purpose of this observational study is to better understand patient/institution factors that may contribute to participation in the pharmacogenomic component of prospective cancer clinical trials.METHODS: Patient demographic information (age, sex, self-reported race) and institutional characteristics (CALGB/CTSU site, ""diversity,"" and accrual) were evaluated for 8456 patients enrolled in seven CALGB phase III studies with a pharmacogenomic component. All statistical tests were two-sided.RESULTS: The majority of patients (81%) consented to participate in the pharmacogenomic component. However, in a multivariable analysis, site (CALGB vs CTSU) and ""institutional diversity"" (percent minority cancer patients on national trials) were statistically significantly associated with participation. For both whites and nonwhites, patients from CALGB sites were more likely to participate compared with patients from CTSU sites (whites: odds ratio [OR] = 2.26, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.68 to 3.04, P < .001; nonwhites: OR = 1.79, 95% CI = 1.52 to 2.11, P < .001). However, as ""institutional diversity"" increased, the likelihood of participation in the pharmacogenomics component decreased for both white (OR = 0.94, 95% CI = 0.91 to 0.97, P < .001) and nonwhite patients (OR = 0.90, 95% CI = 0.81 to 1.00, P = .05).CONCLUSIONS: Most clinical trial cancer patients across geographical, racial, and practice settings are willing to participate in pharmacogenomic studies. However, to promote equitable benefit to the larger cancer community, optimization of both patient and institutional participation are needed. Institutional factors may be even more compelling than patient demographics. Prospective studies are needed to identify and address barriers/incentives to participation in pharmacogenomic research at the patient, clinician, and institutional levels.","['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Clinical Trials, Phase III as Topic', 'Female', 'Healthcare Disparities', 'Humans', 'Leukemia', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multicenter Studies as Topic', 'Neoplasms', 'Odds Ratio', 'Patient Participation', 'Pharmacogenetics']",26160883,"[['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['M01.060.116.100.080'], ['E05.318.372.250.250.220', 'N05.715.360.330.250.250.220', 'N06.850.520.450.250.250.220'], ['N04.590.374.380', 'N05.300.493'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C04.557.337'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['E05.318.372.658', 'N05.715.360.330.643', 'N06.850.520.450.643'], ['C04'], ['E05.318.740.600.600', 'G17.680.500', 'N05.715.360.750.625.590', 'N06.850.520.830.600.600'], ['F01.100.150.750.500.620', 'F01.145.488.887.500.620', 'N02.421.143.212.300', 'N03.540.245.360.300', 'N05.300.150.800.500.620'], ['H01.158.273.343.750', 'H01.158.703.052', 'H02.628.479']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]']",0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0

Action of fatty acids on the exocrine pancreatic secretion of the conscious rat: further evidence for a protein pancreatic inhibitory factor.,The existence of a delayed inhibition of the secretion of protein by the rat pancreas after intraduodenal injection of oleic acid has been confirmed. 1. This phenomenon is not dependent on the presence or absence of bile or pancreatic juice in the intestine. 2. The action of oleic acid is not a pathological phenomenon due to lesions of the gut mucosa because isotonic solutions of Na oleate dispersed into polysorbate 80 or olive oil (rich in oleic acid) plus pancreatic juice have the same effect. 3. Fatty acids must be free or saponified but not esterified in the form of triglycerides. Triglycerides are only effective if pancreatic juice is simultaneously reintroduced into the duodenum. 4. Oleic acid (C18 mono?ne) is more efficient than caprylic acid (C8) and butyric acid (C4) is ineffective. The effect of chain length in releasing the inhibitory factor is therefore approximately the same as in CCK-PZ release. 5. Intraduodenal infusion of hypertonic glucose solution does not inhibit pancreatic protein secretion indicating that release of enteroglucagon is probably not responsible for the inhibition. The inhibitory action of hypertonic NaCl solution is not explained.,"['Animals', 'Butyrates', 'Caprylates', 'Fatty Acids', 'Glucose', 'Male', 'Oleic Acids', 'Osmolar Concentration', 'Pancreas', 'Pancreatic Juice', 'Proteins', 'Rats', 'Secretory Rate', 'Triglycerides']",633115,"[['B01.050'], ['D02.241.081.114', 'D10.251.400.143'], ['D02.241.081.222', 'D10.251.122'], ['D10.251'], ['D09.947.875.359.448'], ['D10.251.355.325.600'], ['G02.640'], ['A03.734'], ['A12.200.567'], ['D12.776'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700'], ['G03.857'], ['D10.351.801']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Biologically active synthetic peptides as probes of embryonic development: a competitive peptide inhibitor of fibronectin function inhibits gastrulation in amphibian embryos and neural crest cell migration in avian embryos.,"We describe a new method for analyzing embryonic events dependent on a specific peptide recognition signal. A short, specific amino acid sequence in fibronectin has been implicated as a recognition site in fibronectin-mediated interactions. Fibroblast adhesion to fibronectin is competitively inhibited by certain synthetic peptides, including the decapeptide Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser-Pro-Ala-Ser-Ser-Lys-Pro, which appears to contain the cell recognition sequence. We found that this peptide inhibited both amphibian gastrulation and avian neural crest cell migration in vivo, as well as the attachment and migration of neural crest cells in vitro. These processes are major cell migratory events previously suggested to involve fibronectin. Negative controls included another conserved fibronectin peptide from the collagen-binding region containing the sequence Cys-Gln-Asp-Ser-Glu-Thr-Arg-Thr-Phe-Tyr and another peptide. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of using synthetic peptides directed at recognition sites in extracellular proteins as probes of morphogenetic processes, and they provide further support for the hypothesis that fibronectin is involved in gastrulation and neural crest cell migration.","['Animals', 'Cell Movement', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chick Embryo', 'Fibronectins', 'Gastrula', 'Microscopy, Electron, Scanning', 'Neural Crest', 'Oligopeptides', 'Peptide Fragments', 'Pleurodeles', 'Quail']",6490722,"[['B01.050'], ['G04.198', 'G07.568.500.180'], ['A11.251'], ['A13.350.150', 'A16.331.200'], ['D12.776.377.715.390', 'D12.776.395.550.350', 'D12.776.543.550.350', 'D12.776.860.300.450'], ['A16.441'], ['E01.370.350.515.402.541', 'E05.595.402.541'], ['A16.627'], ['D12.644.456'], ['D12.644.541'], ['B01.050.150.900.090.608.700.540'], ['B01.050.150.900.248.350.650']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Five patients underwent segmental fibula resection because of tumour disease, seven patients by reason of harvesting an intercalary allograft. Five patients suffered from lower leg pain. Spindle-shaped thickenings of the tibial cortex could be confirmed by most x-rays, in one case the tibial shaft diameter increased up to 10%. Usually the rest of the fibula will become atrophic in grown-up patients; in children the fibula may restore completely if the preparation is performed by sparing the periosteum. Three patients suffered a stress fracture of the tibia. As pain and tibial stress fracture appeared mainly if the remaining fibula was less than 1/4th of the original fibula length, the distal part should be preserved longer if justifiable from an oncological point of view.

Should the amputations of the great toe be replanted?,"Seventeen great toes, amputated at the distal phalangeal to the level of the MTP joint, were replanted between 1990 and 1998, at Izmir Hand and Microsurgery Hospital. Replantation in five out of six complete amputations, and seven out of eleven incomplete amputations were successful, and the overall survival rate was 76.4%. In failed replantations, the base of the proximal phalanx of the great toe was preserved during closing of the stump. Nine of 17 patients were available for review in the follow-up period of mean 3.5 years (range 1-6.5 years). Clinical and biomechanical evaluations of the operated feet were carried out in five patients who had replanted great toe, and in four patients who had amputated one. The uninjured sides were used as control group. The patients in the two groups had no significant subjective symptoms, nearly normal ROM of the MTP joint and protective sensation was achieved in the replanted great toes. With the numbers available, while radiographical parameters of the involved and the control sides demonstrated no significant differences in either groups, pedographical studies revealed consistent changes in weight-bearing distribution of the feet with amputated great toes.

Assessment of pain in temporomandibular disorders: the bio-psychosocial complexity.,"Temporomandibular joint disorders (TMD) affect the joint, the masticatory muscles, or are expressed as a clinical combination of these two factors. The aims of this study were to: (i) identify the clinical and psychosocial factors that aid in the diagnosis and classification of acute and chronic TMD, (ii) determine specific initiating and perpetuating factors which may act as a guide to differentiate between acute and chronic TMD, (iii) identify factors which might predispose to conversion from acute to chronic TMD. Twenty-two patients were examined in the pain clinics at the Eastman Dental Institute. The assessment technique incorporated questionnaires, clinical history and examination including dental panoramic tomography. The results of this pilot study show a significant correlation between mood and enjoyment of life in both groups, mood and relationships in the chronic group, average pain and sleep in the chronic group, average pain and eating-chewing in the chronic group, and phobia for physical disease with trust in clinicians in the chronic group.

Here, we demonstrate that LON protease 2 (LON2), which is encoded by ABERRANT PEROXISOME MORPHOLOGY 10 (APEM10), is responsible for the functional transition of peroxisomes with autophagy. The Arabidopsis apem10 mutant displayed accelerated peroxisome degradation and a dramatically reduced number of peroxisomes. LON2 deficiency caused enhanced peroxisome degradation by autophagy, and peroxisomal proteins accumulated in the cytosol due to a decrease in the number of peroxisomes. We also show the proteolytic consequence of LON2 for the degradation of peroxisomal proteins, and we demonstrated that unnecessary proteins are eliminated by LON2- and autophagy-dependent degradation pathways during the functional transition of peroxisomes. LON2 plays dual roles as an ATP-dependent protease and a chaperone. We show that the chaperone domain of LON2 is essential for the suppression of autophagy, whereas its peptidase domain interferes with this chaperone function, indicating that intramolecular modulation between the proteolysis and chaperone functions of LON2 regulates degradation of peroxisomes by autophagy.","['Arabidopsis', 'Arabidopsis Proteins', 'Autophagy', 'Molecular Chaperones', 'Peroxisomes', 'Protease La']",24492254,"[['B01.650.940.800.575.912.250.157.100'], ['D12.776.765.149'], ['G04.011'], ['D12.776.580'], ['A11.284.430.214.190.500.585.600', 'A11.284.430.214.190.875.190.190.755.600'], ['D08.811.277.040.013.500.032.099.750', 'D08.811.277.040.025.024.032.099.750', 'D08.811.277.656.149.099.750', 'D08.811.277.656.300.065.750', 'D12.776.157.025.750.032.099.750']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Psychosis Following an Increase in Intrathecal Baclofen.,"Baclofen is a commonly used medication to treat spasticity in neurologic disorders. In the traumatic brain injury (TBI) population, the intrathecal administration of baclofen is often preferred over oral administration due to cognitive side effects. Here we report on a case of a psychotic episode following an increase in intrathecal baclofen in a young man with a history of a TBI. Although intrathecal baclofen is commonly used and is generally well tolerated, this case highlights an important potential effect of intrathecal baclofen that has rarely been reported in the literature.LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: V.","['Baclofen', 'Brain Injuries, Traumatic', 'Humans', 'Injections, Spinal', 'Male', 'Muscle Relaxants, Central', 'Muscle Spasticity', 'Psychotic Disorders']",27346089,"[['D02.241.081.114.500.350.100'], ['C10.228.140.199.444', 'C10.900.300.087.235', 'C26.915.300.200.194'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E02.319.267.530.580'], ['D27.505.696.510', 'D27.505.696.663.700.600', 'D27.505.954.427.525'], ['C05.651.512', 'C10.597.613.550.550', 'C23.888.592.608.550.550'], ['F03.700.675']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]']",0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Virological characteristics of hepatitis C virus infection in chronic hemodialysis patients: a cross-sectional study.,"Detection of hepatitis C virus viremia (HCV RNA) in serum of hemodialysis (HD) patients is crucial for documenting ongoing infection because the clinical and epidemiological importance of anti-HCV positivity is not clear. HCV viremia was studied in 104 HD patients by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT PCR) using primers localized in the 5' non-coding region of the viral genome. We used two different methods to detect HCV RNA: a direct PCR amplification of HCV RNA from human serum, and a standard RT PCR procedure (requiring the RNA extraction step). There were 50 (48%) anti-HCV positive patients in this population. Twenty-two (21.1%) out of 104 patients showed HCV RNA in serum by standard RT PCR technique: they belonged to the anti-HCV positive patient group, whereas all anti-HCV negative patients were HCV RNA negative. Prevalence of HCV RNA was more than doubled when standard RT PCR was used compared to direct RT PCR protocol. There was a good association between serum HCV RNA and circulating anti-HCV antibodies, tested by second-generation ELISA and RIBA assays. HCV viremia was not associated with either the presence or the absence of a particular RIBA antibody specificity. AST and ALT levels had no predictive value for HCV viremia, because they were repeatedly normal in the majority of viremic patients (16/22: 73%).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Female', 'Hepacivirus', 'Hepatitis C', 'Hepatitis C Antibodies', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Kidney Failure, Chronic', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Prevalence', 'RNA, Viral', 'Renal Dialysis', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Seroepidemiologic Studies', 'Specimen Handling', 'Viremia']",7554533,"[['E05.318.372.500.875', 'N05.715.360.330.500.875', 'N06.850.520.450.500.875'], ['E05.478.566.350.170', 'E05.478.566.380.360', 'E05.478.583.400.170', 'E05.601.470.350.170', 'E05.601.470.380.360'], ['B04.450.380', 'B04.820.578.344.475'], ['C01.221.250.750', 'C01.925.440.440', 'C01.925.782.350.350', 'C06.552.380.705.440'], ['D12.776.124.486.485.114.254.450.510', 'D12.776.124.790.651.114.254.450.510', 'D12.776.377.715.548.114.254.450.510'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E05.478.566.320', 'E05.601.470.320'], ['C12.777.419.780.750.500', 'C13.351.968.419.780.750.500'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['E05.393.620.500'], ['E05.318.308.985.525.750', 'N01.224.935.597.750', 'N06.850.505.400.975.525.750', 'N06.850.520.308.985.525.750'], ['D13.444.735.828'], ['E02.870.300', 'E02.912.800'], ['E05.318.370.800', 'E05.318.740.872', 'G17.800', 'N05.715.360.325.700', 'N05.715.360.750.725', 'N06.850.520.445.800', 'N06.850.520.830.872'], ['E05.318.372.500.950', 'N05.715.360.330.500.950', 'N06.850.520.450.500.950'], ['E01.370.225.998', 'E05.200.998'], ['C01.925.937', 'C23.550.470.790.500.900']]","['Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
Thermal epiphysiodesis performed with radio frequency in a porcine model.,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Current techniques for epiphysiodesis involve opening of cortical windows; use of staples, screws, and tension devices; and fusion with curettes or drills. Complications may have serious consequences. There is a need for a more reliable, precise, and less traumatic procedure that overcomes the known complications from existing techniques. We analyzed a new epiphysiodesis technique using radio-frequency ablation (RFA) in a porcine model.METHODS: Six 35-kg and two 25-kg immature pigs were used. 1 hind leg of each animal was randomly selected and the proximal tibia growth plate was ablated laterally and medially. The contralateral leg was used as a control. MR images were obtained immediately after the ablation and 12 weeks later for 6 animals, and 24 weeks later for the other 2 animals. CT was done for the 2 animals that were followed for 24 weeks for proof of bone bridges.RESULTS: Both tibias were equal in length initially. At the 12-week follow-up, there was an average leg length discrepancy of 3.9 mm (95% CI: 3.0-4.8), and at 24 weeks the difference was 8.4 mm and 7.5 mm. No damage to the adjacent tissue was found. Bone bridges and physeal closure were found after 24 weeks. The pigs showed no discomfort after the intervention.INTERPRETATION: We found RFA to be feasible for epiphysiodesis in a pig model. The method is minimally invasive and recovery may be quick compared to conventional methods. We recommend that the method should be tested in larger-scale safety studies before clinical application.","['Ablation Techniques', 'Animals', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Epiphyses', 'Female', 'Growth Plate', 'Leg Length Inequality', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Radiosurgery', 'Swine', 'Tibia']",25036720,"[['E04.014'], ['B01.050'], ['C22.232', 'E05.598.500', 'E05.599.395.080'], ['A02.835.232.251'], ['A02.835.232.251.352'], ['C05.116.099.655', 'C23.300.808'], ['E01.370.350.825.500'], ['E02.815.530', 'E04.525.800.650', 'E05.873.500'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.500.880'], ['A02.835.232.043.650.883']]","['Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Long-term Results of 180 Consecutive Patients with Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Treated with the Endurant Stent Graft System.,"BACKGROUND: Registry studies have shown that the Endurant stent graft is associated with low rates of all-cause and aneurysm-related mortality when used for the endovascular treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). However, many were limited by length of follow-up and all had a proportion of patients lost to follow-up. The aim of this study is to report results from a large, real-world experience using Endurant, utilizing methods to ensure complete ascertainment of mortality.METHODS: This study describes a large, single vascular unit experience using the Endurant stent graft in consecutive patients treated between August 2008 and March 2019.RESULTS: One-hundred eighty patients (mean age 76.0 ± 8.6 years; 90% male) with mean AAA diameter of 57.5 ± 10.5 mm underwent endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR). Technical success was achieved in all cases. At median follow-up of 55.0 months (interquartile range 29.8-79.0), 51 (28.3%) patients had died. Kaplan-Meier estimate of 5-year overall survival and freedom from aneurysm-related death was 71.6% and 99.4%, respectively. Lower survival rates were observed in patients who underwent EVAR at age ?80 years (59.2% vs. 78.3%, P < 0.01) and with aneurysm diameter ?70 mm (55.6% vs. 73.8%, P = 0.03). Thirteen endoleaks (7.2%; 4 type 1A, 2 type 1B, 7 type 2) were observed during follow-up (mean time from implantation 8.7 ± 4.2, range 1-52 months). Eleven patients (6.1%) required secondary intervention for limb occlusion (n = 7), endoleak (n = 3), and restenosis (n = 1). Patients treated within (n = 104; 57.8%) and outside (n = 76; 42.2%) the manufacturer's instructions for use (IFU) had similar rates of endoleak (7 [6.7%] vs. 6 [7.9%]; P = 0.76), secondary re-intervention (7 [6.7%] vs. 4 [5.3%]; P = 0.74) and overall-survival (72 [69.2%] vs. 55 [72.3%]; P = 0.46).CONCLUSIONS: Results from this real-world study of consecutive patients treated for AAA using the Endurant stent graft demonstrate that it is safe and effective, with excellent long-term outcomes for anatomy that falls both inside and outside IFU recommendations.","['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Aortic Aneurysm, Abdominal', 'Blood Vessel Prosthesis', 'Blood Vessel Prosthesis Implantation', 'Databases, Factual', 'Endovascular Procedures', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Postoperative Complications', 'Prospective Studies', 'Prosthesis Design', 'Risk Factors', 'Stents', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']",32205240,"[['M01.060.116.100'], ['M01.060.116.100.080'], ['C14.907.055.239.075', 'C14.907.109.139.075'], ['E07.695.110'], ['E04.100.814.868.500', 'E04.650.200'], ['L01.313.500.750.300.188.400', 'L01.470.750.750'], ['E04.100.814.529', 'E04.502.382'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C23.550.767'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.625', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.650', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.650'], ['E05.320.550', 'E07.695.680'], ['E05.318.740.600.800.725', 'N05.715.350.200.700', 'N05.715.360.750.625.700.700', 'N06.850.490.625.750', 'N06.850.520.830.600.800.725'], ['E07.695.750'], ['G01.910.857'], ['E01.789.800', 'N04.761.559.590.800', 'N05.715.360.575.575.800']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0
"Seasonal variation in paired maternal-newborn serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D and 24,25-dihydroxyvitamin D concentrations in Israel.","Seasonal changes were observed in the vitamin D status of mothers and their newly born infants in sunny Israel. Maternal and newborn serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OHD) were lower (less than 0.01) in March-April (n = 45 pairs), than in September-October (n = 33 pairs). Parallel seasonal changes were also found in serum 24,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [24, 25-(OH)2D] concentrations. In the spring, 20% of the mothers and 40% of their infants had vitamin D deficiency or borderline serum 25-OHD levels. In the autumn, in contrast, none of the mothers and only one newborn were vitamin D-deficient, and one mother and two newborns had borderline serum 25-OHD levels. The results demonstrate that even in Mediterranean climates there are seasonal changes in maternal vitamin D status, which have a significant effect on the serum levels of vitamin D metabolites in their newborn infants. This raises the question as to whether vitamin D supplements should be given to pregnant women in Israel, at least during the winter.","['24,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D 3', 'Adult', 'Calcifediol', 'Dihydroxycholecalciferols', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Israel', 'Pregnancy', 'Seasons', 'Vitamin D']",3497905,"[['D04.210.500.247.222.159.478.387.400', 'D04.210.500.247.808.146.478.387.400', 'D04.210.500.812.768.196.478.387.400', 'D10.570.938.146.478.387.400'], ['M01.060.116'], ['D04.210.500.247.222.159.478.250', 'D04.210.500.247.808.146.478.250', 'D04.210.500.812.768.196.478.250', 'D10.570.938.146.478.250'], ['D04.210.500.247.222.159.478.387', 'D04.210.500.247.808.146.478.387', 'D04.210.500.812.768.196.478.387', 'D10.570.938.146.478.387'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.703.520'], ['Z01.252.245.500.375'], ['G08.686.784.769'], ['G01.910.645.661', 'G16.500.275.071.590', 'N06.230.300.100.250.525'], ['D04.210.500.812.768']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Health Care [N]']",0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1
Changes in limb dynamics during the practice of rapid arm movements.,"In our study we examined Bernstein's hypothesis that practice alters the motor coordination among the muscular and passive joint moments. In particular, we conducted dynamical analyses of a human multisegmental movement during the practice of a task involving the upper extremity. Seven male human volunteers performed maximal-speed, unrestrained vertical arm movements whose upward and downward trajectories between two target endpoints required the hand to round a barrier, resulting in complex shoulder, elbow, and wrist joint movements. These movements were recorded by high-speed cin? film, and myopotentials from selected upper-extremity muscles were recorded. The arm was modeled as interconnected rigid bodies, so that dynamical interactions among the upper arm, forearm, and hand could be calculated. With practice, subjects achieved significantly shorter movement times. As movement times decreased, all joint-moment components (except gravity) increased, and the moment-time and EMG profiles were changed significantly. Particularly during reversals in movement direction, the changes in moment-time and EMG profiles were consistent with Bernstein's hypothesis relating practice effects and intralimb coordination: with practice, motor coordination was altered so that individuals employed reactive phenomena in such a way as to use muscular moments to counterbalance passive-interactive moments created by segment movements.","['Action Potentials', 'Adult', 'Arm', 'Electromyography', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Movement', 'Muscles', 'Physical Education and Training', 'Time Factors']",2613716,"[['G04.580.100', 'G07.265.675.100', 'G11.561.570.100'], ['M01.060.116'], ['A01.378.800.075'], ['E01.370.405.255', 'E01.370.530.255'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['G07.568', 'G11.427.410'], ['A02.633', 'A10.690'], ['I02.233.543'], ['G01.910.857']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]']",1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
The complete genome of a viable archaeum isolated from 123-million-year-old rock salt.,"Live microbes have been isolated from rock salt up to Permian age. Only obligatory cellular functions can be performed in halite-buried cells. Consequently, their genomic sequences are likely to remain virtually unchanged. However, the available sequence information from these organisms is scarce and consists of mainly ribosomal 16S sequences. Here, live archaea were isolated from early Cretaceous (? 123 million years old) halite from the depth of 2000 m in Qianjiang Depression, Hubei Province, China. The sample was radiologically dated and subjected to rigorous surface sterilization before microbe isolation. The isolates represented a single novel species of Halobacterium, for which we suggest the name Halobacterium hubeiense, type strain Hbt. hubeiense JI20-1. The species was closely related to a Permian (225-280 million years old) isolate, Halobacterium noricense, originating from Alpine rock salt. This study is the first one to publish the complete genome of an organism originating from surface-sterilized ancient halite. In the future, genomic data from halite-buried microbes can become a key factor in understanding the mechanisms by which these organisms are able to survive in harsh conditions deep underground or possibly on other celestial bodies.","['Base Sequence', 'China', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'DNA, Archaeal', 'Genome, Archaeal', 'Halobacterium', 'Phylogeny', 'RNA, Ribosomal, 16S', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Sodium Chloride']",26628271,"[['G02.111.570.080', 'G05.360.080', 'L01.453.245.667.080'], ['Z01.252.474.164'], ['G02.111.570.080.708.800.325.500', 'G05.360.080.708.800.325.500', 'G05.360.340.024.850.069'], ['D13.444.308.180'], ['G05.360.340.358.050'], ['B02.200.400.400.410'], ['G05.697', 'G16.075.605', 'L01.100.697'], ['D13.444.735.686.670'], ['E05.393.760.700'], ['D01.210.450.150.875', 'D01.857.650']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1
SO2-* electron transfer ion/ion reactions with disulfide linked polypeptide ions.,"Multiply-charged peptide cations comprised of two polypeptide chains (designated A and B) bound via a disulfide linkage have been reacted with SO2-* in an electrodynamic ion trap mass spectrometer. These reactions proceed through both proton transfer (without dissociation) and electron transfer (with and without dissociation). Electron transfer reactions are shown to give rise to cleavage along the peptide backbone, loss of neutral molecules, and cleavage of the cystine bond. Disulfide bond cleavage is the preferred dissociation channel and both Chain A (or B)-S* and Chain A (or B)-SH fragment ions are observed, similar to those observed with electron capture dissociation (ECD) of disulfide-bound peptides. Electron transfer without dissociation produces [M + 2H]+* ions, which appear to be less kinetically stable than the proton transfer [M + H]+ product. When subjected to collision-induced dissociation (CID), the [M + 2H]+* ions fragment to give products that were also observed as dissociation products during the electron transfer reaction. However, not all dissociation channels noted in the electron transfer reaction were observed in the CID of the [M + 2H]+* ions. The charge state of the peptide has a significant effect on both the extent of electron transfer dissociation observed and the variety of dissociation products, with higher charge states giving more of each.","['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Cattle', 'Disulfides', 'Electrons', 'Ions', 'Lactalbumin', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oxytocin', 'Peptides', 'Somatostatin', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization', 'Sulfites']",15914021,"[['G02.111.570.060', 'L01.453.245.667.060'], ['B01.050'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.500.380.271'], ['D01.248.497.158.874.390', 'D01.875.350.850.150', 'D02.886.520.150'], ['G01.249.335', 'G01.358.500.750'], ['D01.248.497'], ['D12.776.034.398', 'D12.776.256.159.750.816.250'], ['L01.453.245.667'], ['D06.472.699.631.692.433', 'D12.644.548.691.692.433'], ['D12.644'], ['D06.472.699.327.700.875', 'D06.472.699.587.780', 'D12.644.400.400.700.875', 'D12.644.548.365.700.875', 'D12.644.548.586.780', 'D12.776.631.650.405.700.875'], ['E05.196.566.600'], ['D01.248.497.158.904', 'D01.875.750']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
[A Case of Huge Advanced Neuroendocrine Carcinoma of the Transverse Colon Resected Successfully].,"The patient, 49-year-old woman, who was referred to our hospital in August 2016 because of left abdominal pain. The abdominal CT scan showed a large tumor, over 10 cm dimeter at splenic flexure of the transverse colon, and colonoscopy detected transvers colon cancer(por, cT4b, cN1, M0, cStage III A). There was no distant metastasis, although invasion to the retroperitoneum and the abdominal wall. Left hemicolectomy was successfully performed with D3 lymph node dissection. Pathological diagnosis was endocrine cell carcinoma, pT4a(SE), pN0, M0, pStage II . The Surgical margin was completely free of carcinoma(R0). The postoperative course was uneventful, and she has been in good health with no recurrence for 8 months after surgery. Neuroendocrine cell carcinoma is recommended for adjuvant treatment based on small cell lung cancer, but there are not effective clinical trials nor established treatment methods because it is rare disease.","['Carcinoma, Neuroendocrine', 'Colectomy', 'Colon, Transverse', 'Colonic Neoplasms', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Middle Aged']",29394710,"[['C04.557.465.625.650.240', 'C04.557.470.200.025.370', 'C04.557.580.625.650.240'], ['E04.210.219'], ['A03.556.124.526.356.834', 'A03.556.249.249.356.834'], ['C04.588.274.476.411.307.180', 'C06.301.371.411.307.180', 'C06.405.249.411.307.180', 'C06.405.469.158.356.180', 'C06.405.469.491.307.180'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.116.630']]","['Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Named Groups [M]']",1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
Practical approach to the evaluation of industrial wastewater treatment by the application of advanced microbiological techniques.,"In cork industry, the operation of boiling raw cork generates large volumes of wastewater named Cork Boiling Wastewater (CBW). The main characteristics are the low biodegradability and medium to low acute toxicity, resulting in the necessity of designing advanced biological treatments by possible conventional activated sludge adaptation. In order to evaluate the variation of bacterial population along that process, a study based on optical microscopy, plate count, DNA extraction, qPCR and massive sequencing techniques was performed. Results showed a diminution of the total and volatile solids (TSS and VSS), jointly with a decrease in DNA concentration, general bacteria (16 S) and ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB). After a few hours of testing, diverse microbiological species died while others showed a possible adaptation of the biological system, accompained by a dissolved organic carbon (DOC) reduction. In addition, toxicity tests based on activated sludge showed the development of chronic toxicity through the contact time. Combination of classical and advanced microbiological techniques, such as quantitative real time Polymerase Chain Reaction (qPCR) and metagenomics, was essential to predict the variation of species during the experiment and to conclude if effective biological adaptation could be finally attained for the target complex wastewater.","['Bacteria', 'Biodegradation, Environmental', 'Metagenomics', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sewage', 'Waste Disposal, Fluid', 'Waste Water']",30265875,"[['B03'], ['N06.230.080.600.500', 'N06.850.460.375.500'], ['H01.158.273.343.350.261'], ['G02.700', 'G03.295.531'], ['E05.393.620.500.706'], ['D20.944.932.500'], ['N06.850.780.200.800.800.890', 'N06.850.860.510.900.600.900'], ['D20.944.932', 'N06.850.460.710.865']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]']",0,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0
MyD88-deficient Hydra reveal an ancient function of TLR signaling in sensing bacterial colonizers.,"Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling is one of the most important signaling cascades of the innate immune system of vertebrates. Studies in invertebrates have focused on the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster and the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, and there is little information regarding the evolutionary origin and ancestral function of TLR signaling. In Drosophila, members of the Toll-like receptor family are involved in both embryonic development and innate immunity. In C. elegans, a clear immune function of the TLR homolog TOL-1 is controversial and central components of vertebrate TLR signaling including the key adapter protein myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 (MyD88) and the transcription factor NF-êB are not present. In basal metazoans such as the cnidarians Hydra magnipapillata and Nematostella vectensis, all components of the vertebrate TLR signaling cascade are present, but their role in immunity is unknown. Here, we use a MyD88 loss-of-function approach in Hydra to demonstrate that recognition of bacteria is an ancestral function of TLR signaling and that this process contributes to both host-mediated recolonization by commensal bacteria as well as to defense against bacterial pathogens.","['Animals', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Base Sequence', 'Colony Count, Microbial', 'Disease Susceptibility', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Hydra', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases', 'Myeloid Differentiation Factor 88', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Phosphorylation', 'Pseudomonas Infections', 'Pseudomonas aeruginosa', 'RNA, Ribosomal, 16S', 'Sequence Analysis, RNA', 'Signal Transduction', 'Toll-Like Receptors']",23112184,"[['B01.050'], ['D27.505.954.122.085'], ['G02.111.570.080', 'G05.360.080', 'L01.453.245.667.080'], ['E01.370.225.875.220', 'E05.200.875.220'], ['C23.550.291.687', 'G07.100.250'], ['E05.393.332'], ['G05.308'], ['E05.393.335.500'], ['B01.050.500.308.485.400'], ['D08.811.913.696.620.682.700.567.374', 'D12.644.360.450.340', 'D12.776.476.450.340'], ['D12.644.360.024.311', 'D12.776.157.057.074', 'D12.776.476.024.390'], ['E05.393.661.640', 'E05.393.760.640', 'E05.588.570.660', 'E05.601.640'], ['G02.111.665', 'G02.607.780', 'G03.796'], ['C01.150.252.400.739'], ['B03.440.400.425.625.625.100', 'B03.660.250.580.590.050'], ['D13.444.735.686.670'], ['E05.393.760.710'], ['G02.111.820', 'G04.835'], ['D12.776.543.750.705.910.500']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Diseases [C]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
Intracellular location of mycoplasmas in cultured cells demonstrated by immunocytochemistry and electron microscopy.,"Mycoplasma fermentans (strain 'incognitus') was incubated with HeLa cells for up to 96 h. After 24 h, mycoplasma organisms were demonstrated intracellularly by immunocytochemistry using mule anti-M. fermentans antiserum and gold labelling on ultrathin sections of both Lowicryl K4M and Araldite-embedded HeLa cells, the latter being treated with hydrogen peroxide. The Araldite-embedded cells were fixed with glutaraldehyde and osmium tetroxide in the presence of ruthenium red to stain the mucopolysaccharide surface components of both the procaryotic and eucaryotic cells. Intracellular localization of some M. fermentans organisms was confirmed by exclusion of ruthenium red from their membranes. Various numbers of mycoplasma organisms were seen per cell and occasionally some were within vacuoles, the membranes of which were also unstained by ruthenium red. The PG18 strain of M. fermentans and a strain of M. hominis were also detected intracellularly using similar methodology and homologous mule or rabbit antisera. The occasional presence of both apparently normal and some denser degenerate mycoplasmas in the same cell may indicate gradual degradation by phagolysosomal digestion.","['HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Mycoplasma', 'Mycoplasma fermentans']",1768615,"[['A11.251.210.190.400', 'A11.251.860.180.400', 'A11.436.340'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E01.370.225.500.607.512', 'E01.370.225.750.551.512', 'E05.200.500.607.512', 'E05.200.750.551.512', 'E05.478.583', 'H01.158.100.656.234.512', 'H01.158.201.344.512', 'H01.158.201.486.512', 'H01.181.122.573.512', 'H01.181.122.605.512'], ['E01.370.350.515.402', 'E05.595.402'], ['B03.440.860.580.553.553'], ['B03.440.860.580.553.553.315']]","['Anatomy [A]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]']",1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
Computerized Dead-Space Volume Measurement of Face Masks Applied to Simulated Faces.,"BACKGROUND: The dead-space volume (VD) of face masks for metered-dose inhaler treatments is particularly important in infants and young children with asthma, who have relatively low tidal volumes. Data about VD have been traditionally obtained from water displacement measurements, in which masks are held against a flat surface. Because, in real life, masks are placed against the face, VD is likely to differ considerably between masks depending upon their contour and fit. The aim of this study was to develop an accurate and reliable way to measure VD electronically and to apply this technique by comparing the electronic VD of commonly available face masks.METHODS: Average digital faces were obtained from 3-dimensional images of 270 infants and children. Commonly used face masks (small and medium) from various manufacturers (Monaghan Medical, Pari Respiratory Equipment, Philips Respironics, and InspiRx) were scanned and digitized by means of computed tomography. Each mask was electronically applied to its respective digital face, and the VD enclosed (mL) was computerized and precisely measured.RESULTS: VD varied between 22.6 mL (SootherMask, InspiRx) and 43.1 mL (Vortex, Pari) for small masks and between 41.7 mL (SootherMask) and 71.5 mL (AeroChamber, Monaghan Medical) for medium masks. These values were significantly lower and less variable than measurements obtained by water displacement.CONCLUSIONS: Computerized techniques provide an innovative and relatively simple way of accurately measuring the VD of face masks applied to digital faces. As determined by computerized measurement using average-size virtual faces, the InspiRx masks had a significantly smaller VD for both small and medium masks compared with the other masks. This is of considerable importance with respect to aerosol dose and delivery time, particularly in young children.

Redesign of thoracic surgical services within a cancer network-using an oncology focus to inform change.,"Thoracic surgical services for one cancer network in London are based at one NHS Trust. Approximately 80% of the surgery performed in the period January-December 2003 was for the diagnosis, palliation or treatment of cancer. The range of different patient groups and needs is very wide, ranging from teenagers undergoing metastatectomy to adults and older adults undergoing resections or palliative surgery. An audit of lung cancer resections performed in 2001 on behalf of the Network lung tumour board indicated that the service was fragmented and there were several bottlenecks in the lung cancer pathway, causing patient delays and a feeling of dissatisfaction amongst referrers and patients. A clinician with oncology experience was appointed in 2002. Immediate action to track patients and ensure referrers knew the outcome of surgery and histology was taken. As part of the NHS Modernisation agenda, the local Cancer Services Collaborative then facilitated mapping the pathway for lung cancer, identifying problems and ways of tackling them. Changes from this, subsequent initiatives and adopting a collaborative approach have also had a positive impact on the lung cancer service. These strategies have been adapted to all thoracic surgery pathways for cancer or suspected cancer. Examples include decreased wait time, sector-wide patient information, multiprofessional working practice and educational initiatives.","['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Cancer Care Facilities', 'Humans', 'London', 'Lung Neoplasms', 'Middle Aged', 'Organizational Case Studies', 'Organizational Innovation', 'Program Evaluation', 'State Medicine', 'Thoracic Surgery']",15774343,"[['M01.060.057'], ['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['N02.278.421.556.070'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['Z01.433.553', 'Z01.542.363.300.553'], ['C04.588.894.797.520', 'C08.381.540', 'C08.785.520'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['N03.349.380.710', 'N05.715.360.455'], ['N04.452.610'], ['E05.337.820', 'N04.761.685', 'N05.715.360.650'], ['N03.349.550.902', 'N03.858'], ['H02.403.810.803']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]']",0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1
Malignant fibrous histiocytoma of the pharynx.,"Malignant fibrous histiocytoma (MFH) is the most common soft-tissue sarcoma of late adult life, but is relatively uncommon in the head and neck region. That region has been reported to be the origin of malignant fibrous histiocytoma in 3-10% of cases. Only one case of the tumor occurring in the pharynx has been reported. Histologically it is sometimes hard to distinguish this tumor from some sarcomas and pleomorphic carcinomas. The treatment of choice is a large surgical resection, while radiotherapy and chemotherapy are reserved for recurrences. The authors present a case of oropharyngeal malignant fibrous histiocytoma. The patient complained dysphagia and dyslalia progressively worsening in six months. Pharyngo-laryngoscopy revealed a mass of the left lateral wall of oro and hypopharynx. CT scan examination showed a capsuled mass which displaced but not involved the neck neurovascular structures; there was no evidence of linphonodal involvement. Transoral surgical excision of the mass was performed with the preservation of speech and swallowing. For more than 1 year postoperatively, there has been no evidence of the disease or metastasis.","['Histiocytoma, Benign Fibrous', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pharyngeal Neoplasms', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed']",12642957,"[['C04.557.450.565.590.425.350'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['C04.588.443.665.710', 'C07.550.745', 'C09.647.710', 'C09.775.549'], ['E01.370.350.350.810', 'E01.370.350.600.350.700.810', 'E01.370.350.700.700.810', 'E01.370.350.700.810.810', 'E01.370.350.825.810.810']]","['Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
TideHunter: efficient and sensitive tandem repeat detection from noisy long-reads using seed-and-chain.,"MOTIVATION: Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) and Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) sequencing technologies can produce long-reads up to tens of kilobases, but with high error rates. In order to reduce sequencing error, Rolling Circle Amplification (RCA) has been used to improve library preparation by amplifying circularized template molecules. Linear products of the RCA contain multiple tandem copies of the template molecule. By integrating additional in silico processing steps, these tandem sequences can be collapsed into a consensus sequence with a higher accuracy than the original raw reads. Existing pipelines using alignment-based methods to discover the tandem repeat patterns from the long-reads are either inefficient or lack sensitivity.RESULTS: We present a novel tandem repeat detection and consensus calling tool, TideHunter, to efficiently discover tandem repeat patterns and generate high-quality consensus sequences from amplified tandemly repeated long-read sequencing data. TideHunter works with noisy long-reads (PacBio and ONT) at error rates of up to 20% and does not have any limitation of the maximal repeat pattern size. We benchmarked TideHunter using simulated and real datasets with varying error rates and repeat pattern sizes. TideHunter is tens of times faster than state-of-the-art methods and has a higher sensitivity and accuracy.AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: TideHunter is written in C, it is open source and is available at https://github.com/yangao07/TideHunter.","['High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Nanopores', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Software', 'Tandem Repeat Sequences']",31510677,"[['E05.393.760.319'], ['J01.637.512.650'], ['E05.393.760.700'], ['L01.224.900'], ['G02.111.570.080.708.800', 'G05.360.080.708.800', 'G05.360.340.024.850']]","['Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0
Multimodality imaging in Europe: a survey by the European Association of Nuclear Medicine (EANM) and the European Society of Radiology (ESR).,"PURPOSE: Multimodality imaging represents an area of rapid growth with important professional implication for both nuclear medicine physicians and radiologists throughout Europe. As a preliminary step for future action aimed at improving the quality and accessibility of PET/SPECT/CT multimodality imaging practice in Europe, the European Association of Nuclear Medicine (EANM) and the European Society of Radiology (ESR) performed a survey among the individual membership of both societies to obtain information on the status of multimodality imaging in their facilities and their future visions on training for combined modalities.METHODS: A questionnaire was forwarded to all individual members of the EANM and ESR. The main subject matter of the questionnaire related to: (1) study performance,current procedures, current equipment including its supervisory personnel at respondents' individual facilities and (2)vision of future practice, performance and the potential for combined interdisciplinary viewing and training for future professionals.RESULTS: The reporting and the billing procedures of multimodality imaging studies are very heterogeneous in European countries. The majority of the members of both societies believe that the proportion of PET/CT conducted as a full diagnostic CT with contrast enhancement will increase over time. As expected, (18)F-FDG is the most commonly used PET tracer for clinical applications. The large majority of respondents were in favour of an interdisciplinary training programme being developed on a European level together by the EANM and the ESR and the respective sections of the European Union of Medical Specialists.CONCLUSION: The results of this survey show that there is wide heterogeneity in the current practice of multimodality imaging in Europe. This situation may limit the full potential and integration of multimodality imaging within the clinical arena. There is a strong desire within both specialties for the development of interdisciplinary training to address some of these issues.","['Europe', 'Health Care Surveys', 'Nuclear Medicine', ""Practice Patterns, Physicians'"", 'Subtraction Technique', 'Tomography, Emission-Computed']",19915843,"[['Z01.542'], ['E05.318.308.980.344', 'N03.349.380.210', 'N05.425.210', 'N05.715.360.300.800.344', 'N06.850.520.308.980.344'], ['H02.403.740.500'], ['N04.590.374.577', 'N05.300.625'], ['E01.370.350.760'], ['E01.370.350.350.800', 'E01.370.350.600.350.800', 'E01.370.350.710.800', 'E01.370.350.825.800', 'E01.370.384.730.800']]","['Geographicals [Z]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]']",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1
Pathogenetic changes in the lung bud of mutant rats with heritable pulmonary lobation anomalies.,"The present study aimed at investigating pathogenesis of pulmonary lobation anomalies in fpl/fpl mutant rats. Day 12-15 embryos were first examined for pulmonary lobation. Lung serial sections were then made and examined for bronchial branching and distribution of extracellular matrices (ECMs). The lung buds of both fpl/fpl embryos and their phenotypically normal fpl/+ littermates were formed as bilateral protrusion of the foregut on gestation day 12. In fpl/+ embryos, three processes appeared on the right lung bud on day 13, and fissures were completely formed by day 14. In fpl/fpl embryos, the right lung bud had no clear process on gestation day 13, and fissures were not formed on day 14 and thereafter, with the exception of incomplete separation between the cranial and middle lobes. Histological observation revealed that the right main bronchial bud of fpl/+ embryos ramified all lobar bronchial buds by gestation day 13. ECMs, a borderline between endodermal bronchial buds and surrounding mesenchyme, disappeared at the distal end of each lobar bronchial bud. By contrast, in fpl/fpl embryos, the right main bronchial bud did not ramify the middle and intermediate lobar bronchial buds at its lateral and ventral portions, but swelled on gestation day 13. It was covered with ECMs at the lateral side but not at the ventral region, from which the middle and intermediate lobar bronchial buds arose on gestation day 14. These observations suggest that altered distribution of ECMs causes branching abnormalities of the lobar bronchial buds and subsequent lobation anomalies in fpl/fpl embryos.","['Animals', 'Female', 'Lung', 'Male', 'Microscopy, Electron, Scanning', 'Rats', 'Rats, Mutant Strains']",7871481,"[['B01.050'], ['A04.411'], ['E01.370.350.515.402.541', 'E05.595.402.541'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700.550']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Efficacy of reductive ventricular osmotherapy in a swine model of traumatic brain injury.,"BACKGROUND: The presence of osmotic gradients in the development of cerebral edema and the effectiveness of osmotherapy are well recognized. A modification of ventriculostomy catheters described in this article provides a method of osmotherapy that is not currently available. The reductive ventricular osmotherapy (RVOT) catheter removes free water from ventricular cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) by incorporating hollow fibers that remove water vapor, thereby providing osmotherapy without increasing osmotic load.OBJECTIVE: To increase osmolarity in the ventricular CSF through use of RVOT in vivo.METHODS: Twelve Yorkshire swine with contusional injury were randomized to external ventricular drainage (EVD) or RVOT for 12 hours. MR imaging was obtained. Serum, CSF, and brain ultrafiltrate were analyzed. Histology was compared using Fluor-Jade B and hematoxylin and eosin (H & E) stains.RESULTS: With RVOT, CSF osmolality increased from 292 ± 2.7 to 345 ± 8.0 mOsmol/kg (mean ± SE, P = 0.0006), and the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) in the injury region increased from 0.735 ± 0.047 to 1.135 ± .063 (P = 0.004) over 24 hours. With EVD controls, CSF osmolarity and ADC were not significantly changed. Histologically, all RVOT pigs showed no evidence of neuronal degeneration (Grade 1/4) compared to moderate degeneration (Grade 2.6 ± .4/4) seen in EVD treated animals (P = 0.02). The difference in intracranial pressure (ICP) by area under the curve approached significance at P = .065 by Mann Whitney test.CONCLUSION: RVOT can increase CSF osmolarity in vivo after experimental traumatic brain injury (TBI). In anticipated clinical use, only a slight increase in CSF osmolarity may be required to reduce cerebral edema.","['Animals', 'Brain Edema', 'Brain Injuries', 'Catheters', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Osmolar Concentration', 'Swine', 'Ventriculostomy']",21826032,"[['B01.050'], ['C10.228.140.187'], ['C10.228.140.199', 'C10.900.300.087', 'C26.915.300.200'], ['E07.132'], ['C22.232', 'E05.598.500', 'E05.599.395.080'], ['G02.640'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.500.880'], ['E04.035.188.957', 'E04.525.170.860']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Modulation of Tamoxifen Cytotoxicity by Caffeic Acid Phenethyl Ester in MCF-7 Breast Cancer Cells.,"Although Tamoxifen (TAM) is one of the most widely used drugs in managing breast cancer, many women still relapse after long-term therapy. Caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE) is a polyphenolic compound present in many medicinal plants and in propolis. The present study examined the effect of CAPE on TAM cytotoxicity in MCF-7 cells. MCF-7 cells were treated with different concentrations of TAM and/or CAPE for 48 h. This novel combination exerted synergistic cytotoxic effects against MCF-7 cells via induction of apoptotic machinery with activation of caspases and DNA fragmentation, along with downregulation of Bcl-2 and Beclin 1 expression levels. However, the mammalian microtubule-associated protein light chain LC 3-II level was unchanged. Vascular endothelial growth factor level was also decreased, whereas levels of glutathione and nitric oxide were increased. In conclusion, CAPE augmented TAM cytotoxicity via multiple mechanisms, providing a novel therapeutic approach for breast cancer treatment that can overcome resistance and lower toxicity. This effect provides a rationale for further investigation of this combination.","['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins', 'Beclin-1', 'Breast Neoplasms', 'Caffeic Acids', 'Female', 'Humans', 'MCF-7 Cells', 'Membrane Proteins', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins', 'Phenylethyl Alcohol', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2', 'Tamoxifen']",26697130,"[['E02.183.750.500', 'E02.319.077.500', 'E02.319.310.037'], ['D12.644.360.075', 'D12.776.476.075'], ['D12.644.360.075.335', 'D12.776.094.500', 'D12.776.476.075.335'], ['C04.588.180', 'C17.800.090.500'], ['D02.241.223.200.054'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['A11.251.210.190.630'], ['D12.776.543'], ['D12.776.220.600.450', 'D12.776.631.560'], ['D02.033.375.650'], ['D12.644.360.075.718', 'D12.776.476.075.718', 'D12.776.624.664.700.169'], ['D02.455.426.559.389.150.700.900']]","['Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
A neglected case of macrodystrophia lipomatosa of the foot in an elderly man.,"Macrodystrophia lipomatosa is a rare disorder characterized by three-dimensional enlargement of one or more fingers or toes with predominantly fibroadipose tissue. Radiographically, it appears as hypertrophy of soft tissues and bones. The pathologic findings are infiltration and hypertrophy of adipose tissue in subcutaneous tissue, nerve sheaths, and periosteum. Macrodystrophia lipomatosa is usually diagnosed during childhood. The case presented here involves the most elderly patient with the condition ever reported, to our knowledge. As such, it may advance current knowledge of macrodystrophia lipomatosa.

The relation between smoking-specific parenting and smoking trajectories of adolescents: how are changes in parenting related to changes in smoking?,"In this study, we tested to what extent smoking-specific parenting and changes in parenting are related to adolescents' smoking trajectories. Data were used from a four-wave prospective study including 428 adolescents (aged M = 15.2; SD = 0.60). Latent Class Growth Analyses were conducted to identify trajectories. Multinomial Logistic Regression Analyses were executed to examine the relations between parenting and class membership. Longitudinal cross-lagged models were tested to examine causal predominance between parenting and smoking. Four trajectories were found, consisting of Non-smokers, Increasers, Stable smokers and Decreasers. Quality of parental smoking-specific communication was strongly related to the membership in different trajectories. Along with the cross-lagged associations demonstrating that the quality of communication was predominantly related to future smoking rather than vice versa, these findings indicate that parents who talked about smoking in a constructive and respectful manner were more likely to have non-smoking children. In contrast, parents who talked often about smoking-related issues and increased these discussions over time were more likely to have smoking children; cross-lagged associations indicated that these findings could be best explained by children changing their parents. Having a non-smoking agreement was related to a lower risk in becoming a regular smoker.","['Adolescent', 'Adolescent Behavior', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interviews as Topic', 'Logistic Models', 'Male', 'Models, Theoretical', 'Netherlands', 'Parenting', 'Prospective Studies', 'Smoking']",20437293,"[['M01.060.057'], ['F01.145.022'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E05.318.308.420', 'L01.399.250.520', 'N05.715.360.300.400', 'N06.850.520.308.420'], ['E05.318.740.500.525', 'E05.318.740.600.800.450', 'E05.318.740.750.450', 'E05.599.835.875', 'N05.715.360.750.530.480', 'N05.715.360.750.625.700.450', 'N05.715.360.750.695.470', 'N06.850.520.830.500.525', 'N06.850.520.830.600.800.450', 'N06.850.520.830.750.450'], ['E05.599'], ['Z01.542.651'], ['F01.829.263.370.310'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.625', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.650', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.650'], ['F01.145.805']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Geographicals [Z]']",0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1
New considerations on pathways involved in acute traumatic coagulopathy: the thrombin generation paradox.,"Background: An acute traumatic coagulopathy (ATC) is observed in about one third of severely traumatized patients. This early, specific, and endogenous disorder is triggered by the association of trauma and hemorrhage. The early phase of this condition is characterized by the expression of a bleeding phenotype leading to hemorrhagic shock and the late phase by a prothrombotic profile leading to multiple organ failure. The physiopathology of this phenomenon is still poorly understood. Hypotheses of disseminated intravascular coagulation, activated protein C-mediated fibrinolysis, fibrinogen consumption, and platelet functional impairment were developed by previous authors and continue to be debated. The objective of this study was to observe general hemostasis disorders in case of ATC to confront these hypotheses.Method: Four groups of 15 rats were compared: C, control; T, trauma; H, hemorrhage; and TH, trauma and hemorrhage. Blood samples were drawn at baseline and 90 min. Thrombin generation tests, platelet aggregometry, and standard hemostasis tests were performed.Results: Significant differences were observed between the baseline and TH groups for aPTT (17.9 ± 0.8 s vs 24.3 ± 1.4 s, p < 0.001, mean ± SEM), MAP (79.7 ± 1.3 mmHg vs 43.8 ± 1.3 mmHg, p < 0.001, mean ± SEM), and hemoglobin (16.5 ± 0.1 g/dL vs 14.1 ± 0.3 g/dL, p < 0.001, mean ± SEM), indicating the presence of an hemorrhagic shock due to ATC. Compared to all other groups, coagulation factor activities were decreased in the TH group, but endogenous thrombin potential was (paradoxically) higher than in group C (312 ± 17 nM/min vs. 228 ± 23 nM/min; p = 0.016; mean ± SEM). We also observed a subtle decrease in platelet count and function in case of ATC and retrieved an inversed linear relationship between fibrinogen concentration and aPTT (intercept, 26.53 ± 3.16; coefficient, - 3.40 ± 1.26; adjusted R 2: 0.1878; p = 0.0123).Conclusions: The clinical-biological profile that we observed, combining normal thrombin generation, fibrinogen depletion, and a hemorrhagic phenotype, reinforced the hypothesis of activated protein C mediated-fibrinolysis. The key role of fibrinogen, but not of the platelets, was confirmed in this study. The paradoxical preservation of thrombin generation suggests a protective mechanism mediated by rhabdomyolysis in case of major trauma. Based on these results, we propose a new conception concerning the pathophysiology of ATC.","['Animals', 'Arterial Pressure', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation', 'Fibrinogen', 'Lactic Acid', 'Potassium', 'Prothrombin', 'Prothrombin Time', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Thrombin', 'Wounds and Injuries']",31857822,"[['B01.050'], ['G09.330.380.076.347'], ['C22.232', 'E05.598.500', 'E05.599.395.080'], ['C15.378.100.220', 'C15.378.463.250', 'C15.378.925.220'], ['D12.776.124.050.250', 'D12.776.124.125.500', 'D12.776.811.300', 'D23.119.490'], ['D02.241.511.459.450'], ['D01.268.549.550', 'D01.268.557.575', 'D01.552.528.652', 'D01.552.547.650'], ['D08.622.709', 'D12.776.124.125.800', 'D12.776.811.243.709', 'D23.119.945'], ['E01.370.225.625.115.610', 'E05.200.625.115.610', 'G09.188.680'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700.750'], ['D08.811.277.656.300.760.855', 'D08.811.277.656.959.350.855', 'D12.776.124.125.890', 'D23.119.960'], ['C26']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
[Effect of rearing method on the storage of fats by adipose tissue in sheep].,"Adipocyte synthesis de novo and lipoprotein lipase activity have been used simultaneously to measure the lipogenic activity of adipose tissue in sheep. Acetate and glucose were used as precursors of fatty acid synthesis. The sheep were raised either outdoors or in a sheepfold. They were slaughtered by lots at mean weights of 24  and 32.5 kg. Compared to lipoprotein lipase activity, de novo synthesis of fatty acids was the main way of constituting lipid depositions. Raising the sheep outdoors favored the use of glucose as precursor of lipid synthesis at the first slaughter stage at 24 kg. Later at 32.5 kg, glucose utilization was practically zero compared to acetate, whatever the mode of rearing. The NADPH production needed for fatty acid synthesis was almost entirely due to NADP isocitrate dehydrogenase activity. Variations in both de novo synthesis and in lipoprotein lipase activity in relation with rearing method and slaughter weight were especially evident in the group raised outdoors.","['Acetates', 'Adipose Tissue', 'Animals', 'Environment', 'Fatty Acids', 'Glucose', 'Lipids', 'Lipoprotein Lipase', 'Male', 'Sheep']",6648030,"[['D02.241.081.018', 'D10.251.400.045'], ['A10.165.114'], ['B01.050'], ['G16.500.275', 'N06.230'], ['D10.251'], ['D09.947.875.359.448'], ['D10'], ['D08.811.277.352.100.430'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.500.380.791']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Health Care [N]']",1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
Functional studies with anti-CD3 heavy chain isotype switch-variant monoclonal antibodies. Accessory cell-independent induction of interleukin 2 responsiveness in T cells by epsilon-anti-CD3.,"A series of heavy chain isotype switch-variant anti-CD3 monoclonal antibodies (mAb) was used to study the proliferation requirements of purified T cells. None of the variant antibodies was able by itself to induce proliferation. In the presence of exogenous interleukin 2 (IL-2) strong mitogenesis was observed upon stimulation with epsilon-anti-CD3, whereas gamma 1, gamma 2b, gamma 2a, and alpha-anti-CD3 failed to induce T cell proliferation. All variant antibodies induced vigorous proliferation in combination with phorbol myristate acetate. Purified T cells, cultured in the presence of epsilon-anti-CD3, in the absence of IL-2, did not express detectable amounts of TAC-antigen (CD25). The binding of the variant antibodies to the CD3 antigen was evaluated in cross-blocking experiments. It was demonstrated that the epsilon-anti-CD3 antibody, in comparison with the other variant mAb, has a relatively low avidity for the CD3 antigen. In modulation experiments, the IgE variant antibody was unable to induce a substantial loss of CD3 antigen. T cell triggering was investigated at the level of Ca2+ mobilization by means of the dye Indo-1. In contrast to the gamma 1, gamma 2b, gamma 2a, and alpha mAb, which induced a rapid and high rise in the free intracellular calcium level, epsilon-anti-CD3 caused a slow and low rise. These studies indicate that the epsilon-anti-CD3 antibody has a low avidity for the CD3 antigen, compared with the other variant mAb, possibly as a result of monovalent binding. Apparently, the avidity and/or valency of CD3 antigen binding not only has a major influence on CD3 modulation and anti-CD3-induced Ca2+ mobilization, but also sets T cell requirements for IL-2 responsiveness.","['Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antibody Affinity', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte', 'Calcium', 'Endocytosis', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin E', 'Immunoglobulin Fab Fragments', 'Immunoglobulin Isotypes', 'Immunologic Capping', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Receptors, Immunologic', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2', 'T-Lymphocytes']",3117878,"[['D12.776.124.486.485.114.224', 'D12.776.124.790.651.114.224', 'D12.776.377.715.548.114.224'], ['G12.040', 'G12.122.125'], ['D23.050.301.264.894', 'D23.101.100.894'], ['D01.268.552.100', 'D01.552.539.288', 'D23.119.100'], ['G04.417'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D12.776.124.486.485.114.619.312', 'D12.776.124.790.651.114.619.312', 'D12.776.377.715.548.114.619.312'], ['D12.644.541.500.650', 'D12.776.124.486.485.680.650', 'D12.776.124.790.651.680.650', 'D12.776.377.715.548.680.650'], ['D12.776.124.486.485.114.619', 'D12.776.124.790.651.114.619', 'D12.776.377.715.548.114.619'], ['G04.774.612', 'G12.122.612'], ['E01.370.225.812.482', 'E05.200.812.482', 'E05.478.594.530', 'G12.450.050.400.545', 'G12.565'], ['D12.776.543.750.705'], ['D12.776.543.750.705.852.420.320'], ['A11.118.637.555.567.569', 'A15.145.229.637.555.567.569', 'A15.382.490.555.567.569']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Restimulation properties of human alloreactive cloned T-cell lines. Dissection of HLA-D-region alleles in population studies and in family segregation analysis.,"Alloactivated human lymphocytes were cloned by limiting dilution. After 1 month in culture with T-cell growth factor several clones incorporated tritiated thymidine when stimulated with the appropriate allogeneic cells. Specificity of restimulation of two primed lymphocyte clones, designated 12-2 and 12-8, was studied in detail after varying periods of culture (up to 50 days). Clone 12-2 cells were stimulated only by cells expressing the HLA-Dw antigens of the original priming cells (Dw3); furthermore, this primed lymphocyte reagent specifically recognized antigens associated with only one of the three distinct Dw3-bearing haplotypes from an informative family (KOH). Clone 12-8 cells, on the other hand, failed to recognize Dw3 antigens in the random panel or on homozygous typing cells (including the original priming cell), but were strongly restimulated by certain cells expressing Dw4 antigens. In addition, within family KOH, these restimulating products segregated with another one of the three Dw3-bearing haplotypes but with none of the three Dw4-bearing haplotypes. These two clones exemplify a hitherto unknown precision in cellular typing of the HLA-D region. Clone 12-2 allows the discrimination of a probably rare and as yet undetected HLA-Dw3 subtypic specificity. Clone 12-8, on the other hand, apparently identifies an allelic system segregating with HLA but distinct from the HLA-D determinants definable by HTC-typing.","['Alleles', 'Clone Cells', 'Female', 'HLA-D Antigens', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Humans', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Male', 'Pedigree', 'T-Lymphocytes']",6242886,[],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Role of putrescine in cell proliferation in a colon carcinoma cell line.,"OBJECTIVES: Putrescine, the precursor for higher polyamine biosynthesis, is necessary for cell growth in mammals. Ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) activity and polyamine production are increased in neoplastic cells. Using colon cancer cell line derived from a tumor with high metastatic potential (CT-26), our objective was to study the effect of exogenous putrescine on ODC regulation, polyamine metabolism, and cell proliferation.METHODS: Cells cultured with fetal calf serum were exposed to 100, 550, and 1000 microM putrescine for 24 h.RESULTS: Intracellular free putrescine, determined by high-performance liquid chromatography, showed a statistically significant increase in exposed cells compared with controls and a significant correlation with levels of the metabolite present in the medium (r = 0.93; P < 0.001). Bromodeoxyuridine incorporation into newly synthesized DNA, a marker of cell proliferation, showed a statistically significant increase in the three putrescine groups as opposed to the control group. In samples with added aminoguanidine, significant increases in DNA synthesis were observed in the 550- and 1000-microM putrescine groups as opposed to the control group. Spermidine and spermine intracellular contents in all three putrescine-treated groups remained below control levels. No statistical differences in ODC enzymatic activity or ODC mRNA content were observed. Newly incorporated putrescine stimulated colon tumor cell growth.CONCLUSIONS: Because neither enhanced conversion into the higher polyamines nor aminoguanidine inhibition of proliferation was observed, we suggest that this effect can be attributed to the putrescine molecule itself.","['Adenocarcinoma', 'Cell Division', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Colonic Neoplasms', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Humans', 'Ornithine Decarboxylase', 'Polyamines', 'Putrescine', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",11744344,"[['C04.557.470.200.025'], ['G04.144.220', 'G04.161.750.500', 'G05.113', 'G07.345.249.410.750.500'], ['E05.196.181.400.300'], ['C04.588.274.476.411.307.180', 'C06.301.371.411.307.180', 'C06.405.249.411.307.180', 'C06.405.469.158.356.180', 'C06.405.469.491.307.180'], ['G07.690.773.875', 'G07.690.936.500'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D08.811.520.224.125.425'], ['D02.092.782'], ['D02.092.211.415.701', 'D02.092.782.258.784'], ['G01.910.857'], ['A11.251.860']]","['Diseases [C]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Effects of polyphenols and lipids from Pennisetum glaucum grains on T-cell activation: modulation of Ca(2+) and ERK1/ERK2 signaling.,"BACKGROUND: Pearl millet (PM), i.e., Pennisetum glaucum, is widely grown in Africa and known for its anti-oxidant and anti-hyperlipidemic properties.METHODS: The P. glaucum grains were obtained from the region of Ouled A?ssa (South of Algeria). We assessed the effects of phenolic compounds and lipids, extracted from seeds of P. glaucum, on rat lymphocyte proliferation, activated by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and ionomycin. In order to explore signaling pathway, triggered by these compounds, we assessed interleukin-2 (IL-2) mRNA expression and extracellular signal-regulated kinase-1/2 (ERK1/ERK2) phosphorylation. Finally, we determined increases in free intracellular Ca(2+) concentrations, [Ca(2+)]i, by employing Fura-2/AM in rat lymphocytes.RESULTS: The composition of P. glaucum grains in polyphenols was estimated to be 1660 µg gallic acid equivalents (GAE)/g. Lipids represented 4.5 %, and more than 72% of the fatty acids belonged to unsaturated family. Our investigation showed that both lipid and phenolic compounds inhibited mitogen-induced T-cell proliferation. Compared with phenolic compounds, lipids exerted weaker effects on ERK-1/ERK2 phosphorylation and Ca(2+) signaling in mitogen-activated T-cells.CONCLUSION: We conclude that the immunomodulatory effects of P. glaucum could be contributed by its phenolic and lipid contents.","['Animals', 'Antioxidants', 'Calcium', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Edible Grain', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases', 'Hypolipidemic Agents', 'Lipids', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3', 'Pennisetum', 'Plant Extracts', 'Polyphenols', 'Rats', 'Seeds', 'Signal Transduction', 'T-Lymphocytes']",26627682,"[['B01.050'], ['D27.505.519.217', 'D27.505.696.706.125', 'D27.720.799.047'], ['D01.268.552.100', 'D01.552.539.288', 'D23.119.100'], ['G04.161.750', 'G07.345.249.410.750'], ['A18.024.500.750.500', 'B01.650.160.250', 'B01.650.510.250', 'G07.203.300.300.550', 'G07.203.300.775.500', 'J02.500.300.550', 'J02.500.775.500'], ['D08.811.913.696.620.682.700.567.249', 'D12.644.360.450.169', 'D12.776.476.450.169'], ['D27.505.519.186.071', 'D27.505.954.557.500'], ['D10'], ['E01.370.225.812.482', 'E05.200.812.482', 'E05.478.594.530', 'G12.450.050.400.545', 'G12.565'], ['D08.811.913.696.620.682.700.567.249.500', 'D12.644.360.450.169.500', 'D12.776.476.450.169.500'], ['D08.811.913.696.620.682.700.567.249.750', 'D12.644.360.450.169.750', 'D12.776.476.450.169.750'], ['B01.650.940.800.575.912.250.822.755'], ['D20.215.784.500', 'D26.667'], ['D02.455.426.559.389.657.715', 'D03.633.100.150.266.450.260.777'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700'], ['A18.024.500.750', 'G07.203.300.775', 'J02.500.775'], ['G02.111.820', 'G04.835'], ['A11.118.637.555.567.569', 'A15.145.229.637.555.567.569', 'A15.382.490.555.567.569']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
The role of NMR imaging in the assessment of multiple sclerosis and isolated neurological lesions. A quantitative study.,"The form and distribution of MRI abnormalities in 114 patients with clinically definite multiple sclerosis (MS) have been compared with observations on 53 apparently healthy individuals, 129 patients with isolated focal neurological lesions with which MS often presents (51 patients with optic neuritis, 44 with isolated brainstem lesions and 34 with isolated spinal cord syndromes) and 105 patients with disorders which may be confused clinically or radiologically with MS. The latter comprised 55 patients with cerebral vascular disease (including 7 cases of dementia with diffuse white matter disease), 24 with degenerative ataxic disorders, 8 with cerebellar tonsillar ectopia, 7 with sarcoidosis and 11 with a variety of other disorders. Periventricular abnormalities were found in all but 2 patients with MS and discrete white matter lesions in all but 12. Characteristically the periventricular changes in MS were irregular in outline. Periventricular abnormalities which were often milder and of smooth outline were seen in 37/55 patients with cerebral vascular disease, 9/24 with cerebellar degeneration, 5/7 with sarcoidosis and in 2/3 apparently healthy individuals over the age of 60. The appearances in the 7 cases of dementia resembled those with advanced MS. Cerebellar and/or brainstem atrophy characteristic of the cerebellar degenerations, in the absence of white matter abnormalities, was helpful in making the distinction from MS. Congenital anomalies and tumours in the region of the brainstem and foramen magnum were readily shown. More than half the patients with symptoms attributable to isolated focal neurological lesions had additional lesions at presentation. MS cannot be diagnosed in these cases at presentation, but repeat scans after 5 to 20 months in 25 patients with optic neuritis and 10 with clinically isolated brainstem lesions have shown new lesions in 7 (20%). The patients with new lesions fulfil the criteria for clinically probable MS (Poser et al., 1983). Measurements of T1 and T2 in vivo permitted the distinction of acute from chronic brainstem lesions. There were quantitative differences in T1 and T2 between the normal appearing white matter in MS and normal brain. Studies of postmortem brains provided convincing evidence that the MRI abnormalities in MS correspond with plaques. Evidence is adduced to support the view that an important source of the abnormal NMR signals in acute lesions is oedema, and in chronic lesions is gliosis; demyelination per se is unlikely to make an important contribution.","['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Brain', 'Brain Stem', 'Central Nervous System Diseases', 'Cerebellum', 'Cerebrovascular Disorders', 'Evoked Potentials, Auditory', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Nervous System Diseases', 'Optic Neuritis', 'Spinal Cord']",3427402,"[['M01.060.057'], ['M01.060.116'], ['A08.186.211'], ['A08.186.211.132'], ['C10.228'], ['A08.186.211.132.810.428.200'], ['C10.228.140.300', 'C14.907.253'], ['G07.265.216.500.370', 'G07.888.250', 'G11.561.200.500.370'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E01.370.350.825.500'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['C10.114.375.500', 'C10.314.350.500', 'C20.111.258.250.500'], ['C23.550.737'], ['C10'], ['C10.292.700.550', 'C11.640.576'], ['A08.186.854']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
Enantiomeric separation of methamphetamine and related analogs by capillary zone electrophoresis: intelligence study in routine methamphetamine seizures.,"A method for simultaneous enantiomeric separation of ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, and methamphetamine (MA) in a single run by simple capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE) with beta-cyclodextrin as a chiral selector is described. The effects of the buffer pH, phosphate concentration, beta-cyclodextrin concentration, voltage and temperature on the peak resolution were examined. Good enantiomeric resolution was attained for each analyte under our optimized conditions: 15 mM beta-cyclodextrin, 300 mM NaH2PO4 at pH 2.5 with an uncoated capillary (64.5 cm x 50 microm), applied potential at 20 kV and temperature at 30 degrees C. Ultraviolet (UV) detection at a fixed wavelength (200 nm) was employed using a diode array detector. Using phentermine as an internal standard, migration times for all analytes are reproducible within 0.16% for intra-day and 0.6% for inter-day runs. Application of this method to the analysis of confiscated drugs is discussed.","['Cyclodextrins', 'Electrophoresis, Capillary', 'Forensic Medicine', 'Humans', 'Illicit Drugs', 'Indicators and Reagents', 'Methamphetamine', 'Spectrophotometry, Ultraviolet']",12455645,"[['D04.345.103', 'D09.301.915.400.375', 'D09.698.365.855.400.375'], ['E05.196.401.190', 'E05.301.300.190'], ['H02.403.330', 'I01.198.780.937'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D26.878'], ['D27.720.470.410'], ['D02.092.471.683.152.619'], ['E05.196.712.726.802', 'E05.196.867.826.802']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Organisms [B]']",0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0
"Growth in bone strength, body size, and muscle size in a juvenile longitudinal sample.","A longitudinal sample of 20 subjects, measured an average of 34 to 35 times each at approximately 6-month intervals from near birth through late adolescence, was used to investigate relationships between body size, muscle size, and bone structural development. The section modulus, an index of bone strength, was calculated from humeral and femoral diaphyseal breadth measurements obtained from serial radiographs. Muscle breadths of the forearm and thigh, also measured radiographically, were used to estimate muscle cross-sectional areas. Body size was assessed as the product of body weight and bone length (humeral or femoral). Stature was also investigated as a surrogate body size measure. Growth velocity in femoral strength was strongly correlated with growth velocity in body weight. femoral length (r2=0.65-0.80), very poorly correlated with growth velocity in stature (r2<0.06), and weakly but significantly correlated with growth velocity in thigh muscle size (r2=0.10-.25). Growth velocity in humeral strength was moderately correlated with that for body weight x humeral length (r2=0.40-0.73), very poorly correlated with that for stature (r2<0.05), and showed a marked sex difference with forearm muscle area velocity, with males having a stronger correlation (r2 approximately 0.65) and females a much weaker correlation (r2 approximately 0.15). Ages at peak adolescent growth velocity were nonsignificantly different between bone strength, body weight x bone length, and muscle area, but significantly earlier for stature. Thus, while there was an early adolescent ""lag"" between stature and bone strength, there was no such ""lag"" between a more mechanically appropriate measure of body size and bone strength. ""Infancy peaks"" in bone strength velocities, earlier in the humerus than in the femur and not paralleled by similar changes in body size, may be the result of the initiation of walking, when mechanical loads relative to body size are changing in both the upper and lower limbs. These results argue strongly for the importance of mechanical factors in the development of the preadult skeleton. Body size is the most important element in the weight-bearing lower limb skeleton, while both body size and muscle strength are important in the upper limb, especially in males.","['Adolescent', 'Body Constitution', 'Body Weight', 'Bone Development', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Femur', 'Humans', 'Humerus', 'Infant', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Male', 'Muscle, Skeletal', 'Radiography', 'Weight-Bearing']",13678772,"[['M01.060.057'], ['E01.370.600.115', 'G07.100'], ['C23.888.144', 'E01.370.600.115.100.160.120', 'E05.041.124.160.750', 'G07.100.100.160.120', 'G07.345.249.314.120'], ['G07.345.500.325.377.625.050.500', 'G11.427.578.050.500'], ['M01.060.406'], ['M01.060.406.448'], ['A02.835.232.043.150'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['A02.835.232.087.090.400'], ['M01.060.703'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.500'], ['A02.633.567', 'A10.690.552.500'], ['E01.370.350.700'], ['G01.374.965']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Health Care [N]']",1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
Behavioral treatment of childhood social phobia.,"Sixty-seven children (ages 8 and 12) with social phobia were randomized to either a behavioral treatment program designed to enhance social skills and decrease social anxiety (Social Effectiveness Therapy for Children, SET-C) or an active, but nonspecific intervention (Testbusters).

Mitotic rate and subcutaneous involvement are prognostic factors for survival after recurrence in patients with only locoregional skin metastasis as the first site of recurrence from cutaneous melanoma.,"BACKGROUND: Few reports on literature give detailed figures on prognostic factors of locoregional skin recurrence in cutaneous melanoma.OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate clinical and histological prognostic factors following development of locoregional cutaneous metastasis as the only progression site from melanoma.METHODS: Data from 1327 stage I and II melanoma patients who visited Instituto Valenciano de Oncolog?a and Consorcio Hospital General Universitario de Valencia from 2000 to 2010 were documented in a prospective manner. During follow up, 112 (8.4%) of them developed recurrent disease. A retrospective analysis revealed a subset of 36 patients with locoregional cutaneous metastases as a first event.RESULTS: Significant prognostic factors in the univariate analysis were Breslow thickness, tumor mitotic rate and the presence subcutaneous involvement of the skin metastasis. After multivariate analysis the independent predictive factors for survival after recurrence were tumor mitotic rate (hazard ratio [HR]: 8.6; 95% CI: 1.0-77.2) and subcutaneous involvement of the skin metastasis (HR: 4.3; 95% CI: 1.0-18.5).CONCLUSION: The survival after recurrence of melanoma patients that has relapsed with only locoregional cutaneous metastasis depends on the mitotic rate of the primary tumor and the subcutaneous involvement of the metastasis.","['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Melanoma', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitosis', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local', 'Prognosis', 'Skin Neoplasms', 'Survival Rate']",22303982,"[['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['M01.060.116.100.080'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C04.557.465.625.650.510', 'C04.557.580.625.650.510', 'C04.557.665.510'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['G04.144.220.220.781', 'G05.113.220.781'], ['C04.697.655', 'C23.550.727.655'], ['E01.789'], ['C04.588.805', 'C17.800.882'], ['E05.318.308.985.550.900', 'N01.224.935.698.826', 'N06.850.505.400.975.550.900', 'N06.850.520.308.985.550.900']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]']",0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
Steady-state humic-acid-containing blanket in upflow suspended bed.,"We investigated the effects of turbidity and concentration of humic acid on the steady-state behavior of the blanket, which was coagulated using polyaluminum chloride (PACl) as coagulant. The three-dimensional solid-flux plot was constructed. Based on fixed PACl dosage, the iso-humic-acid solid-flux surfaces stacked that enveloped the feasible regime for the blanket bed. The steady-state point moved toward low solid flux and low solid fraction regime with decreasing initial raw water turbidity and/or increasing humic-acid concentration. Low water turbidity and high humic-acid concentration yielded a bulky blanket, with the former producing clean, and the latter turbid effluent. The presence of humic acid was thereby harmful to blanket strength, except for the case of low raw water turbidity. An optimal range of humic acid for blanket strength and clarification efficiency existed at 1 mg l(-1). Low level of humic acid is beneficial to blanket development with low-turbidity raw water.","['Aluminum Chloride', 'Aluminum Compounds', 'Chlorides', 'Coagulants', 'Drinking', 'Flocculation', 'Humic Substances', 'Nephelometry and Turbidimetry', 'Waste Disposal, Fluid', 'Water Movements', 'Water Purification', 'Water Supply']",15743628,"[['D01.056.031', 'D01.210.450.150.025'], ['D01.056'], ['D01.210.450.150', 'D01.248.497.158.215'], ['D27.505.954.502.270'], ['G07.203.650.283.249', 'G10.261.330.249'], ['E05.196.150.347', 'G02.159.347'], ['D02.241.444', 'D02.455.426.559.389.657.377', 'D20.721.500'], ['E05.196.712.650'], ['N06.850.780.200.800.800.890', 'N06.850.860.510.900.600.900'], ['G16.500.971', 'N06.230.132.644.750', 'N06.230.850'], ['N06.850.780.200.800.800.900.900', 'N06.850.860.510.900.900'], ['J01.293.821.500']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]']",0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0
Effects of conditioned medium from different cultured cell types on aromatase expression in adipose stromal cells.,"OBJECTIVE: To determine whether serum-free (SF) conditioned media (CM) from several human breast cancer cell lines and primary stromal cell cultures contain factor(s) that mimic the marked stimulatory effects of serum on aromatase activity and aromatase P450 (P450arom) gene expression in adipose stromal cells in culture (ASC) in the presence of dexamethasone (DEX).METHODS: Adipose stromal cells, harvested from fresh adipose specimens, were grown to confluence, switched to SF media, and then incubated in the presence or absence of DEX with CM from T47-D breast cancer cells, pre-treated with or without 17 beta-estradiol (E2), and with CM from stromal cell cultures. Aromatase activity of the ASC was determined by the [3H] water release assay. Total RNA was isolated, and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction was performed to determine the expression of various 5'-termini.RESULTS: T47-D CM stimulated aromatase activity in a concentration-dependent manner, similar to that of serum, in ASC incubated with DEX. Estrogen potentiated this in a dose-dependent fashion. The ASC CM and endometrial stromal cell CM also markedly induced aromatase activity in ASC. Heat inactivation destroyed the stimulating ability of CM. The majority of P450arom 5'-termini expressed by ASC incubated with CM plus DEX contained the promoter I.4-specific sequence.CONCLUSIONS: Conditioned media from several breast cancer cell lines and primary stromal cell cultures can mimic the effects of serum in the presence of DEX to stimulate aromatase activity in ASC. These results suggest that undefined, heat-labile and proteinaceous factors are present in CM that stimulate P450arom expression in a fashion similar to that of serum.","['Adipose Tissue', 'Aromatase', 'Breast Neoplasms', 'Culture Media, Conditioned', 'Culture Media, Serum-Free', 'DNA Primers', 'Dexamethasone', 'Estradiol', 'Estrogen Antagonists', 'Female', 'Fulvestrant', 'Humans', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Stromal Cells', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",9420848,"[['A10.165.114'], ['D08.244.453.489.500', 'D08.244.453.915.099', 'D08.811.682.690.708.170.447.500', 'D08.811.682.690.708.170.915.099', 'D12.776.422.220.453.489.500', 'D12.776.422.220.453.915.099'], ['C04.588.180', 'C17.800.090.500'], ['D27.720.470.305.250', 'E07.206.250'], ['D27.720.470.305.255', 'E07.206.255'], ['D13.695.578.424.450.275', 'D27.720.470.530.600.223.600'], ['D04.210.500.745.432.769.344', 'D04.210.500.908.238'], ['D04.210.500.365.415.248', 'D06.472.334.851.437.500'], ['D06.347.295', 'D27.505.696.399.450.327'], ['D04.210.500.365.415.248.660', 'D06.472.334.851.437.500.500'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E05.393.620.500'], ['A11.329.830'], ['A11.251.860']]","['Anatomy [A]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Clinical validation of dried blood spot sampling in therapeutic drug monitoring of ciclosporin A in allogeneic stem cell transplant recipients: direct comparison between capillary and venous sampling.,"BACKGROUND: The immunosuppressive drug ciclosporin A has a narrow therapeutic window and a large inter- and intraindividual pharmacokinetic variability. Therapeutic drug monitoring of ciclosporin is usually performed in ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid blood, obtained by venous sampling. Dried blood spot sampling (DBS) could be a useful alternative sampling method, which also easily allows multiple sampling, for example, for obtaining area under the curve. With DBS, capillary blood is obtained from a finger prick with an automatic lancet by the patients themselves, and the drop of blood is applied to sampling paper. This may limit the number and duration of hospital visits for these patients.METHODS: We describe a validation study in which venous and finger prick blood samples were collected at the same time. Venous sampling was performed by venipuncture, and the ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid blood samples were collected and stored at 4°C until analysis. Finger prick blood samples were collected using an automatic lancing device. The volume of the blood drops of patients was approximately 30 ìL, and blood spots of about 10-mm diameter were produced. Paper disks with a diameter of 8 mm were punched out with an electromagnetic-driven hole puncher. DBS was compared with the routine assay in venous blood. The study population consisted of adult patients (18 years or older) who were treated with ciclosporin A and routinely monitored for adequate blood concentrations.RESULTS: Thirty-eight duplicate dried blood spots and venous samples were studied. Using weighted Deming regression, the slope was 1.01 with a standard error of 0.03 associated with an intercept of -9.0 (standard error = 5.9). These results indicate that there is no significant difference between the 2 sampling methods. For the medical decision level of 300 mcg/L, the bias was -4.7 mcg/L with a 95% confidence interval of -19.2 to 9.8 mcg/L. The Altman-Bland plot showed no difference between the 2 sampling methods.CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that DBS is a valid alternative for conventional venous sampling in allogeneic stem cell transplant recipients.","['Adolescent', 'Capillaries', 'Cyclosporine', 'Dried Blood Spot Testing', 'Drug Monitoring', 'Edetic Acid', 'Fingers', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents', 'Phlebotomy', 'Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Transplantation', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Veins']",23296096,"[['M01.060.057'], ['A07.015.461.165'], ['D04.345.566.235.300', 'D12.644.641.235.300'], ['E01.370.225.124.100.232', 'E05.200.124.100.232'], ['E01.370.520.200'], ['D02.092.782.258.368.250', 'D02.241.081.018.253'], ['A01.378.800.667.430'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D27.505.696.477.656'], ['E01.370.225.998.110.625', 'E02.800.558', 'E04.665.150.625', 'E05.200.998.110.625'], ['E02.095.147.500.500', 'E04.936.225.687'], ['E04.936'], ['E04.936.864'], ['A07.015.908']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
Modulation in aquaglyceroporin AQP1 gene transcript levels in drug-resistant Leishmania.,"Antimonial-containing drugs are the first line of treatment against the parasite Leishmania. Resistance to antimonials has been correlated to its reduced accumulation. We used a dominant negative functional cloning strategy where a Leishmania mexicana expression cosmid bank was transfected in cells resistant to trivalent antimony (SbIII). Cells were selected for increased sensitivity to SbIII. One cosmid was isolated that could bestow SbIII sensitivity to resistant cells. The gene part of this cosmid that is responsible for increased SbIII sensitivity corresponds to AQP1, an aquaglyceroporin. AQP1 was recently shown to be a route by which SbIII can accumulate in Leishmania cells. Transport studies have shown that the L. mexicana AQP1 can restore SbIII transport in resistant cells. Southern blot analysis indicated that the copy number of neither the AQP1 gene nor the other AQP homologues was changed in antimony-resistant mutants of several Leishmania species. The AQP1 gene sequence was also unchanged in mutants. However, the AQP1 RNA levels were downregulated in several Leishmania promastigote species resistant to antimonials. In general, but not always, the level of AQP1 transcript levels correlated well with the accumulation of SbIII and resistance levels in Leishmania cells. AQP1 thus appears to be a key determinant of antimonials accumulation and susceptibility in Leishmania.","['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Antimony', 'Antiprotozoal Agents', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Drug Resistance', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Leishmania', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Parasitic Sensitivity Tests', 'Protozoan Proteins', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA']",16135234,"[['G02.111.570.060', 'L01.453.245.667.060'], ['B01.050'], ['D01.268.513.124', 'D01.268.556.050', 'D01.552.544.050'], ['D27.505.954.122.250.100'], ['A11.251'], ['G07.690.773.984'], ['G05.308'], ['B01.268.475.868.488'], ['L01.453.245.667'], ['E01.370.225.940', 'E05.200.940', 'E05.337.550.700'], ['D12.776.820'], ['E05.393.760.700']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

The recruitment of leukocytes and their interaction with the vessel wall: the role of interleukin-1 and tumor necrosis factor.,"The vascular endothelium has long been considered to have very little or no active function in inflammatory reactions and hemostasis. However, it has been recently discovered that endothelial cells can dramatically change their functional competence in response to the mononuclear phagocyte products interleukin-1 (IL-1) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF). IL-1 induces synthesis of prostacyclin, platelet activating factor, thromboplastin and plasminogen activator inhibitor. Both IL-1 and TNF cause leukocyte adhesion to the endothelium. On the other hand endothelial cells can themselves initiate the immune response through synthesis and release of IL-1. TNF, released in tissues may act as a chemoattractant and further promote interaction of leukocytes with the vascular lining. IL-1 and TNF can therefore act as a communications signal between circulating cells and the vessel wall and play an important role in the inflammatory and coagulation disorders.","['Chemotaxis, Leukocyte', 'Endothelium, Vascular', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-1', 'Leukocytes', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha']",3502509,"[['G04.198.424.233'], ['A07.015.700.500', 'A10.272.491.355'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D12.644.276.374.465.010', 'D12.644.276.374.500.400', 'D12.776.467.374.465.010', 'D12.776.467.374.500.400', 'D23.529.374.465.131', 'D23.529.374.500.400'], ['A11.118.637', 'A15.145.229.637', 'A15.382.490'], ['A11.118.637.555', 'A15.145.229.637.555', 'A15.382.490.555'], ['D12.644.276.374.500.800', 'D12.644.276.374.750.626', 'D12.776.124.900', 'D12.776.395.930', 'D12.776.467.374.500.800', 'D12.776.467.374.750.626', 'D23.529.374.500.800', 'D23.529.374.750.626']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]']",1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Pharmaceutical development and preclinical evaluation of a GMP-grade anti-inflammatory nanotherapy.,"UNLABELLED: The present study describes the development of a good manufacturing practice (GMP)-grade liposomal nanotherapy containing prednisolone phosphate for the treatment of inflammatory diseases. After formulation design, GMP production was commenced which yielded consistent, stable liposomes sized 100nm±10nm, with a prednisolone phosphate (PLP) incorporation efficiency of 3%-5%. Pharmacokinetics and toxicokinetics of GMP-grade liposomal nanoparticles were evaluated in healthy rats, which were compared to daily and weekly administration of free prednisolone phosphate, revealing a long circulatory half-life with minimal side effects. Subsequently, non-invasive multimodal clinical imaging after liposomal nanotherapy's intravenous administration revealed anti-inflammatory effects on the vessel wall of atherosclerotic rabbits. The present program led to institutional review board approval for two clinical trials with patients with atherosclerosis.FROM THE CLINICAL EDITOR: In drug discovery, bringing production to industrial scale is an essential process. In this article the authors describe the development of an anti-inflammatory nanoparticle according to good manufacturing practice.

CO 2 laser surgery in hemophilia treatment.,"The use of CO 2 laser surgery between 1985 and 1991 in South Africa and Portugal for treatment of disorders in patients with mild to moderate cases of hemophilia A is discussed.  Six cases of oral procedures and excision of skin tumors performed during this period are reported.  In most of the cases of mild hemophilia no pre- or postoperative infusion of Factor VIII or desmopressin (DDAVP) was required.  In some cases of moderate hemophilia, patients were infused with desmopressin (0.3 mug/kg body weight) and were treated postoperatively with the use of nasal desmopressin spray (150 mug to each nostril for four weeks following surgery).  Factor VIII levels were measured before surgery.  Follow up of four weeks was uneventful.  The mean average power of the CO 2 laser was 20 W continuous and the pulse duration was 0.1 s for ablational procedures.  For dermatologic procedures, a flexible plastic CO 2 laser hollow fiber was used (Flexilase, Sharplan, Allandale, NJ).  We concluded that CO 2 laser surgery for hemophiliacs has a confirmed place in modern laser technology provided the standard precautions are taken and facilities are available.","['Adult', 'Carbon Dioxide', 'Gingival Hemorrhage', 'Hemangioma', 'Hemophilia A', 'Hemorrhoids', 'Hemostasis, Surgical', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Keratoacanthoma', 'Laser Therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mouth Neoplasms', 'Papilloma', 'Skin Neoplasms']",10183941,"[['M01.060.116'], ['D01.200.200', 'D01.362.150', 'D01.650.550.200'], ['C07.465.625.446', 'C07.465.714.258.250', 'C23.550.414.922.500'], ['C04.557.645.375'], ['C15.378.100.100.500', 'C15.378.100.141.500', 'C15.378.463.500', 'C16.320.099.500'], ['C06.405.469.860.401', 'C14.907.449'], ['E02.520.490', 'E04.350'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.703'], ['C17.800.417'], ['E02.594', 'E04.014.520'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['C04.588.443.591', 'C07.465.530'], ['C04.557.470.700.600'], ['C04.588.805', 'C17.800.882']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

Spermatozoa with high mitochondrial membrane potential and low tyrosine phosphorylation preferentially bind to oviduct explants in the water buffalo (Bubalus bubalis).,"Although it is understood that spermatozoa are subjected to selection processes to form a functional sperm reservoir in the oviduct, the mechanism remains obscure. With the aim to understand the sperm selection process in the oviduct, in the present in vitro study, we analyzed mitochondrial membrane potential and tyrosine phosphorylation status in oviduct-explants bound and unbound spermatozoa. Frozen semen from Murrah buffalo bulls (n=10) used under progeny testing programme were utilized for the study. Oviduct explants were prepared by overnight culture of epithelial cells in TCM- 199 and washed spermatozoa were added to the oviduct explants and incubated for 4h. Mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and tyrosine phosphorylation status of bound and unbound spermatozoa were assessed at 1h and 4h of incubation. The proportion of spermatozoa with high MMP was significantly higher (P<0.001) among the bound spermatozoa (range 84.67-96.56%) compared to unbound (range 8.70-21.03%) spermatozoa. The proportion of tyrosine phosphorylated spermatozoa was significantly higher (P<0.001) among unbound population as compared to bound population. The proportion of spermatozoa displaying tyrosine phosphorylation at acrosomal area was significantly (P<0.05) lower in bound sperm population compared to unbound population.

Iron overload augments the development of atherosclerotic lesions in rabbits.,"Iron, a major oxidant in vivo, could be involved in atherosclerosis through the induction of the formation of oxidized LDL, a major atherogenic factor. This study was designed to test this hypothesis experimentally. Four groups of New Zealand White rabbits were included: iron-overloaded/hypercholesterolemic (group A, n = 8), iron-overloaded (group B, n = 6), hypercholesterolemic (group C, n = 6), and untreated (group D, n = 6). Iron overload was achieved by the intramuscular administration of 1.5 g of iron dextran divided in 30 doses. Hypercholesterolemia was produced by feeding rabbit chow enriched with 0.5% (wt/wt) cholesterol. Serum iron, ferritin, cholesterol, triglycerides, and lipoperoxides in serum were measured throughout the study. Lipoperoxides were measured at the end of the study in liver, aorta, and spleen homogenates. Aortas of groups A and C had multiple lesions; however, group A had greater lesional involvement than group C (P < .05). Lesions were not observed in rabbits fed normal chow (group D). As expected, serum iron and ferritin were above normal levels in groups A and B. Serum cholesterol increased in groups A and C. Lipoperoxides in liver and spleen homogenates of iron-overloaded rabbits were increased. Interestingly, iron deposits were seen by ultrastructural studies in the arterial walls of rabbits in groups A and B. Our study suggests that iron overload augments the formation of atherosclerotic lesions in hypercholesterolemic rabbits.","['Animals', 'Aorta', 'Arteriosclerosis', 'Cholesterol', 'Dextrans', 'Diet, Atherogenic', 'Ferritins', 'Hematocrit', 'Iron', 'Lipid Peroxides', 'Male', 'Rabbits']",7542998,"[['B01.050'], ['A07.015.114.056'], ['C14.907.137.126'], ['D04.210.500.247.222.284', 'D04.210.500.247.808.197', 'D10.570.938.208'], ['D05.750.078.562.272', 'D09.698.365.272'], ['G07.203.650.240.242'], ['D12.776.157.427.249', 'D12.776.556.579.249'], ['E01.370.225.625.400', 'E05.200.625.400', 'G09.188.370.374'], ['D01.268.556.412', 'D01.268.956.287', 'D01.552.544.412'], ['D01.248.497.158.685.750.637', 'D01.339.431.374.637', 'D01.650.550.750.600', 'D02.389.338.450', 'D10.440'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.968.700']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
The first and second cinchona rearrangement. Two fundamental transformations of alkaloid chemistry.,"Stereochemistry, products, and driving forces of the ""first and second Cinchona rearrangement"" have been investigated and a unified theory is presented. The first cage expansion affords [3.2.2]azabicyclic alpha-amino ether and is formulated via a configurationally stable bridgehead iminium ion and quasiequatorial nucleophilic attack. The second cage expansion affords beta-functionalized [3.2.2]azabicycles. In this case a nonclassical nitrogen-bridged cation is postulated to account for retention of configuration and potential reversibility of the cage expansion.

Deepwater horizon oil spill: mental health effects on residents in heavily affected areas.,"BACKGROUND: Mental health issues are a significant concern after disasters such as the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010. This study was designed to assess the mental health effects on residents of areas of southeastern Louisiana affected by the oil spill.METHODS: Telephone and face-to-face interviews were conducted with residents (N = 452) assessing concerns and direct impact.RESULTS: The results show that the greatest effect on mental health related to the extent of disruption to participants' lives, work, family, and social engagement, with increased symptoms of anxiety, depression, and posttraumatic stress. Given the location of the oil spill affecting communities that had been devastated by Hurricane Katrina, results also revealed that losses from Hurricane Katrina were highly associated with negative mental health outcomes. Conversely, the ability to rebound after adversity and place satisfaction were highly associated with better mental health outcomes.CONCLUSIONS: Enhanced understanding of mental health effects after the Deepwater Horizon oil spill will help in determining directions for much-needed mental health services after the disaster and in contributing to the knowledge of complex traumatization and the ability to rebound after adversity.","['Adaptation, Psychological', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Anxiety', 'Community Mental Health Services', 'Depression', 'Disasters', 'Female', 'Gulf of Mexico', 'Humans', 'Interview, Psychological', 'Louisiana', 'Male', 'Mental Health', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Petroleum', 'Petroleum Pollution', 'Psychometrics', 'Public Health', 'Regression Analysis', 'Risk Assessment', 'Social Environment', 'Stress, Psychological', 'Water Pollution', 'Young Adult']",22146666,"[['F01.058'], ['M01.060.057'], ['M01.060.116'], ['F01.470.132'], ['F04.408.307', 'N02.421.143.183', 'N02.421.461.232'], ['F01.145.126.350'], ['N06.230.100'], ['Z01.756.092.325'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['F04.669.599'], ['Z01.107.567.875.750.480'], ['F02.418', 'N01.400.500'], ['E05.318.740.150.500', 'N05.715.360.750.125.500', 'N06.850.520.830.150.500'], ['D20.345.630', 'N06.230.132.258.630'], ['N06.850.460.660'], ['F04.711.780'], ['H02.403.720', 'N01.400.550', 'N06.850'], ['E05.318.740.750', 'N05.715.360.750.695', 'N06.850.520.830.750'], ['E05.318.740.600.800.715', 'N04.452.871.715', 'N05.715.360.750.625.700.690', 'N06.850.505.715', 'N06.850.520.830.600.800.715'], ['I01.880.853.500'], ['F01.145.126.990', 'F02.830.900'], ['N06.850.460.790'], ['M01.060.116.815']]","['Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]']",0,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1
[McArdle's disease in a 14-year-old girl with fatigability and raised muscle enzymes].,"INTRODUCTION: McArdle's disease is a disorder of muscle energy metabolism caused by a deficit of muscle phosphorylase. The typical form presents with fatigability muscle cramps and pains triggered by physical exercise. Some cases have few symptoms. We report the case of a 14 year old girl diagnosed on finding a significantly raised CPK, studied following her complaint of fatigability.CLINICAL CASE: A 14 year old girl presented with a CPK of 1,243 UI/l (normal 10-32) which had been requested in view of her fatigability. She had never had cramps, muscle pains or dark urine. Neurological examination was normal. The levels of CPK after intense exercise on the previous days were 7,459 UI/l, and after rest for one week were 283 UI/l (normal 25-230). The ischemic exercise test showed that she was unable to finish the test, with flat lactate and pyruvate curves and markedly raised ammonia (basal 89 and maximum 571 micrograms/dl). On muscle biopsy, the morphology of the striated muscle was seen to be normal and staining for myophosphorylase was negative.CONCLUSIONS: The fluctuations of muscle enzyme levels in relation to exercise orientate the diagnosis towards a disorder of muscle energy metabolism. To detect this, the investigation should be carried out following severe exercise for several days and then compared with a further test after some days of rest. The ischemic exercise test permits identification of defects of glycogenolysis, orientating the choice of suitable histochemical, enzymatic or molecular biological tests.","['Adolescent', 'Creatine Kinase', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Exercise', 'Exercise Test', 'Fatigue', 'Female', 'Glycogen Storage Disease Type V', 'Humans', 'Lactic Acid', 'Muscle, Skeletal', 'Phosphorylases', 'Pyruvic Acid']",10919189,"[['M01.060.057'], ['D08.811.913.696.640.150'], ['G03.295'], ['G11.427.410.698.277', 'I03.350'], ['E01.370.370.380.250', 'E01.370.386.700.250', 'E05.333.250'], ['C23.888.369'], ['C16.320.565.202.449.560', 'C18.452.648.202.449.560'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D02.241.511.459.450'], ['A02.633.567', 'A10.690.552.500'], ['D08.811.913.400.450.460.400'], ['D02.241.755.812.800']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
Vitamin A deficiency leads to severe functional disturbance of the intestinal epithelium enzymes associated with diarrhoea and increased bacterial translocation in gnotobiotic rats.,"A disturbance of the integrity of the intestinal epithelium with an increased risk for bacterial translocation is one of the suggested factors underlying the increased incidence of infections and septicaemia during vitamin A deficiency. In the present study the effects of vitamin A deficiency on the enzymic activity of enterocytes in response to bacterial colonization with a non-pathogenic Escherichia coli strain were studied in monocolonized and conventional Wistar rats. The monocolonized, but not the conventional, vitamin A-deficient rats had markedly reduced weight compared to their pair-fed controls and presented neurological symptoms, such as hind leg weakness, tremor and slow gait. Moreover, only in the monocolonized vitamin A-deficient rats were severe diarrhoea and bacterial translocation to extraintestinal sites-mainly kidneys-detected. Measurements of enterocyte brush-border enzyme activities revealed that lactase, sucrase, gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase (GGT) and dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP IV) were significantly reduced in the monocolonized vitamin A-deficient rats compared to the pair-fed controls, indicating a severe functional disturbance of the enterocytes. In conventional vitamin A-deficient rats only sucrase activity was markedly lower than in the respective controls. Our observation, that the deficient vitamin A status led to a strong reduction of enterocyte enzymic activities, associated with diarrhoea and increased bacterial translocation, mainly in the gnotobiotic rats, suggests that the composition of the bacterial flora, i.e. the colonization state, has a strong influence on triggering the severity of the functional disturbances of the intestinal epithelium, and adds to the clinical manifestations of vitamin A deficiency.","['Animals', 'Bacteremia', 'Bacterial Translocation', 'Diarrhea', 'Enterocytes', 'Escherichia coli', 'Germ-Free Life', 'Jejunum', 'Microvilli', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar', 'Vitamin A Deficiency']",12737996,"[['B01.050'], ['C01.150.252.100', 'C01.757.100', 'C23.550.470.790.500.100'], ['G06.099.114'], ['C23.888.821.214'], ['A03.556.124.369.290', 'A10.615.550.444.290', 'A11.436.290'], ['B03.440.450.425.325.300', 'B03.660.250.150.180.100'], ['G06.320'], ['A03.556.124.684.500', 'A03.556.249.750'], ['A11.284.180.565'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700.900'], ['C18.654.521.500.133.628']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Hepatoprotective effects of ethanolic extract of Cnidoscolus aconitifolius on paracetamol-induced hepatic damage in rats.,"The study was designed to evaluate the possible hepatoprotective effect of Cnidoscolus aconitifolius on paracetamol poisoning in rats. Twenty five male Wistar rats were used in this study. They were divided into 5 groups of 5 rats. Groups I and II received normal saline (0.9% physiological saline). Animal in groups III-V were administered Cnidoscolus aconitifolius at 100, 500 and 1,000 mg kg(-1), respectively for 7 days. All animal in groups II-V were given paracetamol at 3 g kg(-1) by gastric gavage on days 8 and 9. Animals were sacrificed by cervical dislocation on day 10 after an overnight fast. Paracetamol overdose caused significant (p<0.05) increase in the plasma Alanine aminotransferase (ALT), Aspartate aminotransferase (AST), Alkaline phosphatase (ALP), Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN), triglycerides (TAG) with total cholesterol (TC) and Low Density Lipoprotein (LDL-cholesterol) and significant (p<0.05) decrease Total Protein (TP) and High Density Lipoprotein (HDL-cholesterol) in rats treated with paracetamol alone when compared with rats pre-treated with extract of Cnidoscolus aconitifolius. Pre-treatment with ethanolic extract of Cnidoscolus aconitifolius led to significant (p<0.05) decrease in serum ALT, ALP, AST, LDL and BUN when compared with the paracetamol treated rats in dose-dependent manner. The extract also similarly caused significant (p<0.05) increase in HDL values compared with paracetamol treated group. In conclusion, the results of this study demonstrated that Cnidoscolus aconitifolius can ameliorate paracetamol-induced hepatotoxicity. Significant hepato-protective activity was observed in rats treated with the dose of 1000 mg kg(-1) b.wt.","['Acetaminophen', 'Analgesics, Non-Narcotic', 'Animals', 'Ethanol', 'Euphorbiaceae', 'Liver', 'Liver Diseases', 'Male', 'Plant Extracts', 'Random Allocation', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar']",20437682,"[['D02.065.199.092.040', 'D02.092.146.113.092.040'], ['D27.505.696.663.850.014.040', 'D27.505.954.427.040.100'], ['B01.050'], ['D02.033.375'], ['B01.650.940.800.575.912.250.859.797.438'], ['A03.620'], ['C06.552'], ['D20.215.784.500', 'D26.667'], ['E05.318.370.700', 'E05.581.500.805', 'N05.715.360.325.675', 'N06.850.520.445.700'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700.900']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
Primary cleft nasal repair: the composite V-Y flap with extended mucosal tab.,"A method of primary cleft lip nasal repair utilizing a medially based composite alar flap with a mucosal tab extension is presented. The procedure modifies, with a 5- to 6-mm mucosal tab extension, a previously described chondromucosal flap technique. Most cases were done concurrent with a modified Tennison lip repair. The flap consists of the lateral crus of the alar cartilage, together with its vestibular lining. The flap is advanced medially so the dome provides the tip support for the affected side of the nose. The goal is to restore symmetry, obviating the need for future major nasal surgery. Experience with this technique in 32 patients over 4 years is reported. Although encouraged by our results, it is anticipated significant percentage of patients will still benefit from secondary nasal surgery when their nasal growth is complete.","['Cleft Lip', 'Humans', 'Nasal Septum', 'Surgical Flaps', 'Suture Techniques']",15269575,"[['C07.465.409.225', 'C07.465.525.164', 'C07.650.525.164', 'C16.131.850.525.164'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['A04.531.591'], ['A10.850.710', 'E07.862.710'], ['E04.987.775']]","['Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Reducing Barriers to Patient-Reported Outcome Measures for People With Cognitive Impairments.,"The field of rehabilitation has increasingly called for the use of patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) in research and practice. Given that many rehabilitation patients present with conditions associated with cognitive impairments, it is imperative to reduce barriers to PROM use for this population. The purpose of this article is to develop a comprehensive understanding of cognitive accessibility that can prospectively inform the design of PROMs. We put forth the following definition of cognitive accessibility for PROMs: cognitive accessibility is present when assessment design anticipates respondent variability in cognitive abilities and, to the greatest extent possible, reduces cognitive demands and/or supports cognitive processes to enable respondents with a range of cognitive abilities to interpret and respond to assessment items as intended. Our operationalization of cognitive accessibility in measurement in the field of rehabilitation is informed by 2 assumptions: (1) cognitive accessibility results from an interaction between the individual's capacities and the demands of the assessment and assessment context, and (2) individuals with cognitive impairments have the right to be involved in decisions about their lives, including health care decisions. This article proposes 3 design features that can be optimized for cognitive accessibility: content, layout, and administration procedures. We end with a discussion of next steps that the field of rehabilitation measurement can undertake to advance our understanding of cognitive accessibility.","['Cognitive Dysfunction', 'Humans', 'Patient Outcome Assessment', 'Patient Reported Outcome Measures', 'Physical Therapy Modalities']",28400180,"[['F03.615.250.700'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['N04.761.559.590.399', 'N05.715.360.575.575.399'], ['E05.318.308.980.344.500', 'N03.349.380.210.750', 'N04.761.559.590.399.875', 'N05.425.210.500', 'N05.715.360.300.800.344.500', 'N05.715.360.575.575.399.875', 'N06.850.520.308.980.344.500'], ['E02.779', 'E02.831.535']]","['Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
Is drug-induced hepatitis related to the severity of tuberculous meningitis?,"Background: Drug-induced hepatitis (DIH) occurs more commonly in tuberculous meningitis (TBM) than non-CNS tuberculosis. We evaluate DIH in TBM and its relationship with disease severity and surrogate markers of stress.Methods: Sixty-seven patients with TBM were included prospectively. The diagnosis of DIH was based on five times elevation of alanine amino transferase (ALT) in asymptomatic and three times in symptomatic patients, serum bilirubin 1.5 mg/dL or more occurring after 3 days of antitubercular drugs without any other cause of liver dysfunction; and improvement in liver function upon drug withdrawal. Stage of TBM, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score, signs of raised intracranial pressure (ICP), ESR, C-reactive protein (CRP), systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), serum cortisol and MRI findings were noted on admission and during DIH.Results: A total of 32.8% (22/67) patients with TBM developed DIH that was associated with worsening in GCS score (p=0.01), stage TBM (p=0.02), SIRS parameters (p=0.04), ESR (p=0.04) and CRP (p<0.01) compared with their baseline. Stage of TBM independently predicted DIH (OR=0.42, 95% CI, 0.18-1.0; p=0.04)]. Drug-induced hepatitis occurred with paradoxical worsening in 11 patients and had higher mortality (32% vs 7%; p=0.01).Conclusion: DIH occurred in 32.8% (22/67) of patients with TBM, and was related to the severity of TBM and possibly to the accompanying 'physiological stress'.","['Adult', 'Aged', 'Alanine Transaminase', 'Antitubercular Agents', 'Bilirubin', 'Chemical and Drug Induced Liver Injury', 'Female', 'Hepatitis, Autoimmune', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prospective Studies', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Stress, Physiological', 'Tuberculosis, Meningeal', 'Young Adult']",29438557,"[['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['D08.811.913.477.700.100'], ['D27.505.954.122.085.255'], ['D03.383.129.578.840.249.184', 'D03.633.400.909.249.184', 'D04.345.783.249.184', 'D23.767.193.184'], ['C06.552.100', 'C25.100.562', 'C25.723.260'], ['C06.552.380.350.300', 'C20.111.567'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.625', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.650', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.650'], ['E05.318.308.980.438.475.456.500', 'N05.715.360.300.800.438.375.364.500', 'N06.850.520.308.980.438.475.364.500'], ['G07.775'], ['C01.150.252.223.500.937', 'C01.150.252.223.850.800', 'C01.150.252.410.040.552.846.570.600', 'C01.207.180.500.937', 'C01.207.180.850.800', 'C10.228.228.180.500.937', 'C10.228.228.180.850.800', 'C10.228.614.280.915'], ['M01.060.116.815']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
The place of Homo floresiensis in human evolution.,"Two main evolutionary scenarios have been proposed to explain the presence of the small-bodied and small-brained Homo floresiensis species on the remote Indonesian island of Flores in the Late Pleistocene. According to these two scenarios, H. floresiensis was a dwarfed descendent of H. erectus or a late-surviving remnant of a older lineage, perhaps descended from H. habilis. Each scenario has interesting and important implications for hominin biogeography, body size evolution, brain evolution and morphological convergences. Careful evaluation reveals that only a small number of characters support each of these scenarios uniquely. H. floresiensis exhibits a cranial shape and many cranial characters that appear to be shared derived traits with H. erectus, but postcranial traits are more primitive and resemble those of early Homo or even australopiths. Mandibular and dental traits show a mix of derived and primitive features. Unfortunately, many traits cannot be used to assess these two hypotheses because their distribution in H. erectus, early Homo (e.g., H. habilis), or both is unknown. H. erectus ancestry implies evolutionary convergence on a postcranial configuration similar to australopiths and early Homo, which could be explained by a return to more climbing behaviors. Body size reduction as well as brain size reduction on a scale only rarely documented in mammals would also accompany the origin of H. floresiensis from a H. erectus ancestor. H. habilis ancestry implies parallel evolution of numerous cranial characters, as well as a few dentognathic traits.

"Impact of a parenting program in a high-risk, multi-ethnic community: the PALS trial.","BACKGROUND: Parenting programs have been shown to work when delivered to motivated ethnic majority parents in demonstration projects, but comparatively little is known about their impact when delivered to high-risk, multi-ethnic populations by routine local services.METHODS: The Primary Age Learning Skills (PALS) trial was a randomized controlled trial of an evidence-based parenting-group program that targeted the parent-child relationship and child literacy. Parents of 174 children were selected from a population of 672 5- and 6-year-olds attending four primary schools in a high-risk, ethnically diverse, inner-city area. Eighty-eight children were allocated to the Incredible Years preventive program plus a shortened six-week version of the SPOKES literacy program, delivered by local services; 86 to usual community services; 152/174 (87%) of families were successfully followed up. Parent-child relationship quality and child behavior were measured using direct observation and parent interview; child reading was assessed psychometrically.RESULTS: Two-thirds (58/89) of those offered the parenting program attended at least one session, with similar enrollment rates across the Black African, African-Caribbean, White-British and Other ethnic groups. Mean attendance was four relationship-building sessions and one literacy-development session. Satisfaction questionnaires were completed by 43/58 starters; 93% said they were well or extremely satisfied, with equally high rates across ethnic groups. At follow-up after one year, those allocated to the intervention showed significant improvements in the parent-child relationship on observation and at interview compared to controls; effects were similar across all ethnic groups. However, child behavior problems and reading did not improve. The cost was £1,343 ($2,100) per child.CONCLUSIONS: Programs can be organized to be engaging and effective in improving parenting among high-risk, multi-ethnic communities, which is of considerable value. To also be cost-effective in achieving child changes may require a set-up that enables parents to attend more sessions and/or an exclusive focus on children with clinically significant behavior problems.","['Adult', 'Child', 'Child Behavior', 'Child Behavior Disorders', 'Child, Preschool', 'Ethnic Groups', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Outcome and Process Assessment, Health Care', 'Parent-Child Relations', 'Parenting', 'Parents', 'Psychometrics', 'Reading', 'Residence Characteristics', 'Social Environment']",20868373,"[['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.406'], ['F01.145.179'], ['F03.625.141'], ['M01.060.406.448'], ['M01.686.754', 'N01.224.317'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.249', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.350', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.350'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['N04.761.559', 'N05.715.360.575'], ['F01.829.263.370.290'], ['F01.829.263.370.310'], ['F01.829.263.500.320', 'I01.880.853.150.500.340', 'M01.620'], ['F04.711.780'], ['L01.559.423.557'], ['N01.224.791', 'N06.850.505.400.800'], ['I01.880.853.500']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Information Science [L]']",0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,0
[Gerasimov effect of an alternating magnetic field on clinical characteristics of peripheral blood from women suffering tuboperitoneal infertility of inflammatory origin].,"The influence of an alternating magnetic field (AMF) on the number of erythrocytes, hemoglobin level, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, differential blood cell count, and pH values in peripheral blood was studied in 15 woman volunteers suffering tuboperitoneal infertility (TPI) of inflammatory origin. They were found to have a significantly (p < 0.05) lower number of erythrocytes, absolute number of stab neutrophils, and relative number of segmented neutrophils compared with the respective normal values. In addition, their blood pH values were decreased. The above changes are characteristic of hypoxic conditions supposed ""to train"" tissues for chronic inflammation; such training may underlie the mechanism of therapeutic effect of alternating magnetic field in women with tubuloperitoneal infertility.","['Adult', 'Blood Sedimentation', 'Erythrocyte Count', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Infertility, Female', 'Inflammation', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Magnetic Field Therapy']",20017383,"[['M01.060.116'], ['E01.370.225.625.125', 'E05.200.625.125'], ['E01.370.225.500.195.107.330', 'E01.370.225.625.107.330', 'E05.200.500.195.107.330', 'E05.200.625.107.330', 'E05.242.195.107.330', 'G04.140.107.330', 'G09.188.105.330'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['G02.300'], ['C13.351.500.365.700'], ['C23.550.470'], ['E01.370.225.500.195.107.595', 'E01.370.225.625.107.595', 'E05.200.500.195.107.595', 'E05.200.625.107.595', 'E05.242.195.107.595', 'G04.140.107.595', 'G09.188.105.595'], ['E02.621']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]']",0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

"Socioeconomic status, access to health care, and outcomes after acute myocardial infarction in Canada's universal health care system.","BACKGROUND: There is a debate as to whether universal drug coverage confers similar access to care at all socioeconomic status (SES) levels. Experiences in Canada may bring light to questions raised regarding access.OBJECTIVE: To assess associations between SES and access to cardiac care and outcomes in Canada's universal health care system.DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: All patients admitted to acute care hospitals in Quebec (QC), Ontario (ON), and British Columbia (BC), between 1996 and either 2000 (QC) or 2001 (ON, BC) with acute myocardial infarction, were identified using provincial government administrative databases (n = 145,882).MEASUREMENTS: Variables representing SES grouped at the census area level were examined in association with use of cardiac medications and procedures, survival, and readmission, while adjusting for individual-level variables. A Bayesian hierarchical logistic regression model was used to account for the nested structure of the data.RESULTS: Despite provincial variations in SES and drug reimbursement policies, there were generally no associations between the SES variables and access to cardiac medications or invasive cardiac procedures. The few exceptions were not consistent across SES indicators and/or provinces. Similarly, the only observed effect of SES on clinical outcomes was in BC, where there was increased 1-year mortality among patients living in less-affluent regions (adjusted odds ratios per standard deviation change in proportion of low-income households, 95% Bayesian credible intervals, QC: 1.09, 0.96-1.25; ON: 1.02, 0.95-1.08; and BC: 1.18, 1.09-1.28).CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that intermediary factors other than SES, such as cardiovascular risk factors, likely account for observed ""wealth-health"" gradients in Canada.

Breed differences in fetal and placental development and feto-maternal amino acid status following nutrient restriction during early and mid pregnancy in Scottish Blackface and Suffolk sheep.,"This study assessed the effect of feeding 0.75 energy requirements between Days 1 and 90 of pregnancy on placental development and feto-placental amino acid status on Day 125 of pregnancy in Scottish Blackface and Suffolk ewes carrying a single fetus. Such moderate nutrient restriction did not affect placental size, placentome number or the distribution of placentome types. Although fetal weight was unaffected by maternal nutrition, fetuses carried by nutrient restricted mothers had relatively lighter brains and gastrocnemius muscles. Suffolk fetuses were heavier and longer with a greater abdominal circumference, relatively lighter brains, hearts and kidneys, but heavier spleens, livers and gastrocnemius muscles than Blackface fetuses. Total placentome weight was greater in Suffolk than Blackface ewes. Ewe breed had a greater effect on amino acid concentrations than nutrition. Ratios of maternal to fetal amino acid concentrations were greater in Suffolk ewes than Blackface ewes, particularly for some essential amino acids. The heavier liver and muscles in Suffolk fetuses may suggest increased amino acid transport across the Suffolk placenta in the absence of breed differences in gross placental efficiency. These data provide evidence of differences in nutrient handling and partitioning between the maternal body and the fetus in the two breeds studied.","['Amino Acids', 'Animal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena', 'Animals', 'Body Weight', 'Breeding', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Female', 'Fetal Development', 'Fetus', 'Hydrocortisone', 'Maternal-Fetal Exchange', 'Organ Size', 'Placenta', 'Placentation', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy, Animal', 'Prenatal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena', 'Sheep']",22127007,"[['D12.125'], ['G07.203.650.161'], ['B01.050'], ['C23.888.144', 'E01.370.600.115.100.160.120', 'E05.041.124.160.750', 'G07.100.100.160.120', 'G07.345.249.314.120'], ['E05.820.150', 'G05.090'], ['G03.295'], ['G07.345.500.325.235', 'G08.686.784.170.157'], ['A16.378'], ['D04.210.500.745.745.654.600', 'D06.472.040.585.353.476', 'D06.472.040.585.478.392'], ['G08.686.784.769.455'], ['E01.370.600.115.100.660', 'E05.041.124.715', 'G07.100.100.660', 'G07.345.249.690'], ['A16.710'], ['G08.686.784.769.491'], ['G08.686.784.769'], ['G08.686.784.769.498'], ['G07.203.650.566.624', 'G08.686.784.769.600'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.500.380.791']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Understanding learning transfer of veterans in baccalaureate nursing programs: Their experience as student nurses.,"With the continued growth of the numbers of veterans in nursing programs, faculty need to be aware of how to best facilitate their learning and build on their diverse experiences and expertise. Understanding how veterans transfer learning from the military context to an academic context is crucial for nursing education. The findings of this qualitative descriptive study support that veterans transfer learning from their military experience to their nursing education. Eleven veterans comprised the sample. The themes were: Embracing and living core professional values, Learning from a team-based framework to achieve a common goal, Learning how and when to communicate with faculty and healthcare members, and Incorporating learned behaviors into everyday professional practice. One recommendation for faculty included gaining basic knowledge of military culture and how that influences veterans once they transition to civilian life. The study findings can help faculty to build on previously acquired knowledge and enrich the learning experience for students and faculty. Ultimately, this may help to recruit and retain veterans in nursing programs; thus, impacting the global workforce.","['Adult', 'Clinical Competence', 'Education, Nursing, Baccalaureate', 'Faculty, Nursing', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Problem-Based Learning', 'Qualitative Research', 'Students, Nursing', 'Veterans']",31449991,"[['M01.060.116'], ['I02.399.630.210', 'N04.761.210', 'N05.715.175'], ['I02.358.462.316'], ['M01.526.485.390', 'M01.526.702.250.473', 'N02.360.390'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['F02.463.425.720', 'I02.158.660', 'I02.903.565'], ['H01.770.644.241.850'], ['M01.848.769.685'], ['M01.930']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]']",0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0

Retinoid metabolism in spontaneously transformed mouse fibroblasts (Balb/c 3T12-3 cells): enzymatic conversion of retinol to anhydroretinol.,"Spontaneously transformed mouse fibroblasts (Balb/c 3T12-3 cells) displayed an increased adhesion when cultured in the presence of 10(-6) M all-trans retinol and acquired morphological characteristics of the normal phenotype. Thus it was of interest to investigate the metabolism of [15-(14)C]retinol in this system. Within 24 hours of culture, approximately 4.25% of the [(14)C]retinol was taken up by the cells. The hydrocarbon [(14)C]anhydroretinol was a major metabolic product and was identified by gas-liquid chromatography and by its typical ultraviolet absorption spectrum with maxima at 386, 364, and 346 nm. At 24 and 40 hours anhydroretinol represented 27% and 55%, respectively, of the total nonpolar metabolites or approximately 16% and 30% of the total radioactive products. Formalin-fixed fibroblasts or cultured intestinal mucosal cells did not convert retinol into anhydroretinol. A more polar product with a UV absorption maximum at 310 nm was also found. The time course of the synthesis of this product by 3T12 cells suggested a precursor-product relationship with anhydroretinol. A microsomal preparation from 3T12 cells was also active in synthesizing [(14)C]anhydroretinol and [(14)C]metabolite-310 from [(14)C]retinol. Moreover incubation of metabolite-310 with the 3T12 microsomes yielded anhydroretinol (40% conversion in 30 minutes), suggesting that metabolite-310 is an intermediate in the synthesis of anhydroretinol by these cells. Anhydroretinol appears to be an end product of the metabolism of retinol in 3T12-3 cells, as suggested by the finding that over 90% of [(14)C]anhydroretinol incubated for 30 hours with 3T12-3 cells was recovered unaltered, without the formation of detectable retroretinol, retinol, or retinoic acid.-Bhat, P.

Different on the inside: extreme swimbladder sexual dimorphism in the South Asian torrent minnows.,"The swimbladder plays an important role in buoyancy regulation but is typically reduced or even absent in benthic freshwater fishes that inhabit fast flowing water. Here, we document, for the first time, a remarkable example of swimbladder sexual dimorphism in the highly rheophilic South Asian torrent minnows (Psilorhynchus). The male swimbladder is not only much larger than that of the female (up to five times the diameter and up to 98 times the volume in some cases), but is also structurally more complex, with multiple internal septa dividing it into smaller chambers. Males also exhibit a strange organ of unknown function or homology in association with the swimbladder that is absent in females. Extreme sexual dimorphism of non-gonadal internal organs is rare among vertebrates and the swimbladder sexual dimorphisms that we describe for Psilorhynchus are unique among fishes.","['Air Sacs', 'Animals', 'Cyprinidae', 'Female', 'Male', 'Phylogeny', 'Rivers', 'Sex Characteristics']",25009242,"[['A13.048'], ['B01.050'], ['B01.050.150.900.493.200.244'], ['G05.697', 'G16.075.605', 'L01.100.697'], ['G01.311.750', 'G16.500.275.280.650', 'N06.230.232.650'], ['G08.686.815']]","['Anatomy [A]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Health Care [N]']",1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0
Involvement of the heparanase procoagulant domain in bleeding and wound healing.,"Essentials Heparanase forms a complex with tissue factor and enhances the generation of factor Xa. The present study was aimed to identify the procoagulant domain of heparanase. Procoagulant peptides significantly shortened bleeding time and enhanced wound healing. Tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI)-2 derived peptides inhibited the procoagulant peptides.SUMMARY: Background Heparanase, which is known to be involved in angiogenesis and metastasis, was shown to form a complex with tissue factor (TF) and to enhance the generation of activated factor X (FXa). Our study demonstrated that peptides derived from TF pathway inhibitor (TFPI)-2 impeded the procoagulant effect of heparanase, and attenuated inflammation, tumor growth, and vascularization. Aims To identify the procoagulant domain in the heparanase molecule, and to evaluate its effects in a model of wound healing that involves inflammation and angiogenesis. Methods Twenty-four potential peptides derived from heparanase were generated, and their effect was studied in an assay of FXa generation. Peptides 14 and 16, which showed the best procoagulant effect, were studied in a bleeding mouse model and in a wound-healing mouse model. Results Peptides 14 and 16 increased FXa levels by two-fold to three-fold, and, at high levels, caused consumption coagulopathy. The TFPI-2-derived peptides explored in our previous study were found to inhibit the procoagulant effect induced by peptides 14 and 16. In the bleeding model, time to clot formation was shortened by 50% when peptide 14 or peptide 16 was topically applied or injected subcutaneously. In the wound-healing model, the wound became more vascular, and its size was reduced to one-fifth as compared with controls, upon 1 week of exposure to peptide 14 or peptide 16 applied topically or injected subcutaneously. Conclusions The putative heparanase procoagulant domain was identified. Peptides derived from this domain significantly shortened bleeding time and enhanced wound healing.","['Animals', 'Blood Coagulation', 'Coagulants', 'Factor Xa', 'Fibrin Fibrinogen Degradation Products', 'Fibrinogen', 'Glucuronidase', 'Glycoproteins', 'Hematologic Agents', 'Hemorrhage', 'Humans', 'Inflammation', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Neovascularization, Pathologic', 'Partial Thromboplastin Time', 'Peptides', 'Protein Domains', 'Prothrombin Time', 'Thrombelastography', 'Thromboplastin', 'Thrombosis', 'Wound Healing']",28439967,"[['B01.050'], ['G09.188.390.150'], ['D27.505.954.502.270'], ['D08.811.277.656.300.760.315', 'D08.811.277.656.959.350.315', 'D12.776.124.125.400.315', 'D23.119.400.315'], ['D12.776.124.270.300', 'D12.776.811.300.290'], ['D12.776.124.050.250', 'D12.776.124.125.500', 'D12.776.811.300', 'D23.119.490'], ['D08.811.277.450.426'], ['D09.400.430', 'D12.776.395'], ['D27.505.954.502'], ['C23.550.414'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C23.550.470'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500'], ['C04.697.650', 'C23.550.727.650'], ['C23.550.589.500'], ['E01.370.225.625.115.600', 'E05.200.625.115.600', 'G09.188.660'], ['D12.644'], ['G02.111.570.820.709.275.750', 'G02.111.570.820.709.610.500'], ['E01.370.225.625.115.610', 'E05.200.625.115.610', 'G09.188.680'], ['E01.370.225.625.115.830', 'E05.200.625.115.830'], ['D12.776.124.125.900', 'D23.119.965'], ['C14.907.355.830'], ['G16.762.891']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Hypoplastic acute leukemia: review of 70 cases with multivariate regression analysis.,"Between 1971 and 1984, 22 of 190 adult patients (11.6 per cent) with acute leukemia seen at the University of Arizona had hypocellular acute leukemia (HAL), defined as lymphoblasts or myeloblasts (plus atypical promyelocytes) of greater than or equal to 30 per cent, but marrow cellularity of the core biopsy or clot section of less than or equal to 50 per cent based on a 1000 point count. These 22 patients with HAL plus the 48 previously published patients with well documented HAL (combined series of 70 patients) were evaluated in detail with multivariate analysis. The median leukocyte count was 2700/microL, hemoglobin of 8.2 g/dl, and platelet count 63,000/microL. Circulating blasts were noted in 27 of 52 patients (52 per cent). Twenty-seven of 34 patients (79 per cent) had abnormal cytogenetics. The overall median survival was 8 months (range: 0.1-48). The median survival for the 22 patients managed with supportive care alone was 4 months, 6 months for the 16 patients treated with non-aggressive induction therapy, and 13 months for the 32 patients treated with aggressive induction therapy (p less than 0.02 versus other categories). Multivariate analysis confirmed that aggressive induction therapy was a major favourable prognostic factor (p = 0.016). Multivariate analysis of the aggressively induced patients revealed that younger patients (less than or equal to 65; p = 0.04) and patients with no AHD (p = 0.09) lived longer. Thus, aggressive remission induction can be attempted in HAL and appears to contribute to prolonged survival especially under age 65 years.","['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies']",3557323,"[['C23.550.291.125'], ['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['M01.060.116.100.080'], ['E05.318.740.150', 'N05.715.360.750.125', 'N06.850.520.830.150'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C04.557.337'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['E01.789'], ['E05.318.372.500.500.500', 'E05.318.372.500.750.750', 'N05.715.360.330.500.500.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.825', 'N06.850.520.450.500.500.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.825']]","['Diseases [C]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]']",0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
The meaning of attempted suicide to young parasuicides: a repertory grid study.,"In an attempt to clarify the intentional aspect of parasuicide, constructs in response to a supposed crisis were elicited from a group of overdose patients, using the standard method of contrasting elements. In this case the elements were presented as a list of 11 alternative behaviours (including overdose and suicide) possible in such a situation. Using 9 of the most common constructs obtained, a repertory grid was administered to a second group of overdose patients and by computer analysis consensus group grids were obtained for patients scoring high and low on the Beck suicidal intent scale. These consensus grids showed that the low intent group perceived an overdose (in comparison to other alternative behaviours) as similar to 'being alone and crying' and 'getting drunk' and construed it almost exclusively as an escape from tension. In contrast, the high intent group perceived overdose and suicide in quite similar terms. The data indicated that an overdose may have a respite function for low suicidal intent patients.","['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interpersonal Relations', 'Male', 'Poisoning', 'Suicide, Attempted']",7326540,"[['M01.060.057'], ['M01.060.116'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['F01.829.401'], ['C25.723'], ['F01.145.126.980.875.600', 'I01.880.735.856.600']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]']",0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
Multiple antibiotic resistance genes distribution in ten large-scale membrane bioreactors for municipal wastewater treatment.,"Wastewater treatment plants are thought to be potential reservoirs of antibiotic resistance genes. In this study, GeoChip was used for analyzing multiple antibiotic resistance genes, including four multidrug efflux system gene groups and three â-lactamase genes in ten large-scale membrane bioreactors (MBRs) for municipal wastewater treatment. Results revealed that the diversity of antibiotic genes varied a lot among MBRs, but about 40% common antibiotic resistance genes were existent. The average signal intensity of each antibiotic resistance group was similar among MBRs, nevertheless the total abundance of each group varied remarkably and the dominant resistance gene groups were different in individual MBR. The antibiotic resistance genes majorly derived from Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria. Further study indicated that TN, TP and COD of influent, temperature and conductivity of mixed liquor were significant (P<0.05) correlated to the multiple antibiotic resistance genes distribution in MBRs.","['Actinobacteria', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Bioreactors', 'China', 'Drug Resistance, Microbial', 'Membranes, Artificial', 'Proteobacteria', 'Waste Disposal, Fluid', 'Waste Water', 'beta-Lactamases']",27716561,"[['B03.510.024', 'B03.510.460.400.400.049'], ['D27.505.954.122.085'], ['E07.115', 'J01.897.120.115'], ['Z01.252.474.164'], ['G06.225', 'G07.690.773.984.269'], ['D25.479', 'J01.637.051.479', 'J01.637.087.500'], ['B03.660'], ['N06.850.780.200.800.800.890', 'N06.850.860.510.900.600.900'], ['D20.944.932', 'N06.850.460.710.865'], ['D08.811.277.087.180']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Health Care [N]']",0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1

Diet and risk of lymphoid neoplasms and soft tissue sarcomas.,"The relationship between frequency of intake of selected indicator foods, lymphoid neoplasms, and soft tissue sarcomas was investigated in an updated case-control study conducted in Northern Italy between 1983 and 1992 on 158 incident, histologically confirmed cases of Hodgkin's disease (HD), 429 cases of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), 141 cases of multiple myelomas, 101 cases of soft tissue sarcomas, and 1,157 controls admitted to hospital for acute, nonneoplastic diseases unrelated to long-term modifications of diet. Compared with the lowest tertile, the odds ratio (OR) for the highest tertile of milk intake was 1.8 for NHL and 1.9 for sarcomas. Liver intake was an indicator of the risk of HD (OR = 1.8), NHL (OR = 1.6), and myelomas (OR = 2.0), ham an indicator of HD (OR = 1.7), and butter an indicator of myelomas (OR = 2.8). A high consumption of green vegetables was inversely related to myelomas (OR = 0.4), and frequent use of whole-grain foods was inversely related to NHL (OR = 0.4) and soft tissue sarcomas (OR = 0.2). No material association with meat was observed for any of the neoplasms considered. Likewise, coffee and alcohol intakes were not associated with lymphoid neoplasms and soft tissue sarcomas. The OR for the highest tertile of intake of beta-carotene ranged between 0.5 and 0.7, whereas the OR for retinol ranged between 1.5 and 2.3. Although available data do not point to any specific inference, this study suggests that certain aspects of diet are a correlate or an indicator of the risk of lymphoid neoplasms and soft tissue sarcomas.","['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Animals', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Daucus carota', 'Diet', 'Dietary Fats', 'Edible Grain', 'Female', 'Fishes', 'Hodgkin Disease', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin', 'Male', 'Multiple Myeloma', 'Odds Ratio', 'Risk Factors', 'Sarcoma', 'Vegetables']",9101555,"[['M01.060.057'], ['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['B01.050'], ['E05.318.372.500.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.500'], ['B01.650.940.800.575.912.250.075.278'], ['G07.203.650.240'], ['D10.212.302', 'G07.203.300.375', 'J02.500.375'], ['A18.024.500.750.500', 'B01.650.160.250', 'B01.650.510.250', 'G07.203.300.300.550', 'G07.203.300.775.500', 'J02.500.300.550', 'J02.500.775.500'], ['B01.050.150.900.493'], ['C04.557.386.355', 'C15.604.515.569.355', 'C20.683.515.761.355'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C04.557.386.480', 'C15.604.515.569.480', 'C20.683.515.761.480'], ['C04.557.595.500', 'C14.907.454.460', 'C15.378.147.780.650', 'C15.378.463.515.460', 'C20.683.515.845', 'C20.683.780.650'], ['E05.318.740.600.600', 'G17.680.500', 'N05.715.360.750.625.590', 'N06.850.520.830.600.600'], ['E05.318.740.600.800.725', 'N05.715.350.200.700', 'N05.715.360.750.625.700.700', 'N06.850.490.625.750', 'N06.850.520.830.600.800.725'], ['C04.557.450.795'], ['B01.650.160.956', 'B01.650.510.956', 'G07.203.300.850', 'J02.500.850']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Diseases [C]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0
Ophthalmologic abnormalities among students with cognitive impairment in eastern Taiwan: The special group with undetected visual impairment.,"PURPOSE: Students with cognitive impairment are at increased risk of suffering from visual impairment due to refractive errors and ocular disease, which can adversely influence learning and daily activities. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the ocular and visual status among students at the special education school in Hualien.METHODS: All students at the National Hualien Special Education School were evaluated. Full eye examinations were conducted by a skilled ophthalmologist. The students' medical records and disability types were reviewed.RESULTS: A total of 241 students, aged 7-18 years, were examined. Visual acuity could be assessed in 138 students. A total of 169/477 (35.4%) eyes were found to suffer from refractive errors, including 20 eyes with high myopia (?-6.0 D) and 16 eyes with moderate hypermetropia (+3.0 D to +5.0 D). A total of 84/241 (34.8%) students needed spectacles to correct their vision, thus improving their daily activities and learning process, but only 15/241 (6.2%) students were wearing suitable corrective spectacles. A total of 55/241 students (22.8%) had ocular disorders, which influenced their visual function. The multiple disability group had a statistically significant higher prevalence of ocular disorders (32.9%) than the simple intellectual disability group (19.6%).CONCLUSION: Students with cognitive impairment in eastern Taiwan have a high risk of visual impairment due to refractive errors and ocular disorders. Importantly, many students have unrecognized correctable refractive errors. Regular ophthalmic examination should be administered to address this issue and prevent further disability in this already handicapped group.","['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Cognitive Dysfunction', 'Disabled Children', 'Education, Special', 'Eye Diseases', 'Eyeglasses', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Prevalence', 'Refractive Errors', 'Risk Factors', 'Taiwan', 'Vision Disorders', 'Visual Acuity']",27742159,"[['M01.060.057'], ['M01.060.406'], ['F03.615.250.700'], ['M01.150.200'], ['I02.233.213'], ['C11'], ['E07.632.500.300'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E05.318.308.985.525.750', 'N01.224.935.597.750', 'N06.850.505.400.975.525.750', 'N06.850.520.308.985.525.750'], ['C11.744'], ['E05.318.740.600.800.725', 'N05.715.350.200.700', 'N05.715.360.750.625.700.700', 'N06.850.490.625.750', 'N06.850.520.830.600.800.725'], ['Z01.252.474.872', 'Z01.639.850'], ['C10.597.751.941', 'C11.966', 'C23.888.592.763.941'], ['E01.370.380.850.950', 'F02.463.593.932.901', 'G14.940']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",0,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1
Extracorporeal shock wave therapy does not improve hypertensive nephropathy.,"Low-energy extracorporeal shock wave therapy (SWT) has been shown to improve myocardial dysfunction, hind limb ischemia, erectile function, and to facilitate cell therapy and healing process. These therapeutic effects were mainly due to promoting angiogenesis. Since chronic kidney diseases are characterized by renal fibrosis and capillaries rarefaction, they may benefit from a proangiogenic treatment. The objective of our study was to determine whether SWT could ameliorate renal repair and favor angiogenesis in L-NAME-induced hypertensive nephropathy in rats. SWT was started when proteinuria exceeded 1 g/mmol of creatinine and 1 week after L-NAME removal. SWT consisted of implying 0.09 mJ/mm(2) (400 shots), 3 times per week. After 4 weeks of SWT, blood pressure, renal function and urinary protein excretion did not differ between treated (LN + SWT) and untreated rats (LN). Histological lesions including glomerulosclerosis and arteriolosclerosis scores, tubular dilatation and interstitial fibrosis were similar in both groups. In addition, peritubular capillaries and eNOS, VEGF, VEGF-R, SDF-1 gene expressions did not increase in SWT-treated compared to untreated animals. No procedural complications or adverse effects were observed in control (C + SWT) and hypertensive rats (LN + SWT). These results suggest that extracorporeal kidney shock wave therapy does not induce angiogenesis and does not improve renal function and structure, at least in the model of hypertensive nephropathy although the treatment is well tolerated.","['Animals', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Hypertension, Renal', 'Kidney', 'Lithotripsy', 'Male', 'NG-Nitroarginine Methyl Ester', 'Nephritis', 'Rats', 'Treatment Outcome']",27255359,"[['B01.050'], ['C22.232', 'E05.598.500', 'E05.599.395.080'], ['C12.777.419.331', 'C13.351.968.419.331', 'C14.907.489.631'], ['A05.810.453'], ['E02.600', 'E04.943.500'], ['D12.125.068.050.525', 'D12.125.095.104.525'], ['C12.777.419.570', 'C13.351.968.419.570'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700'], ['E01.789.800', 'N04.761.559.590.800', 'N05.715.360.575.575.800']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Health Care [N]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

Each case requires faunistic observation and epidemiological and morphological studies to exclude diagnostic confusion between very similar morphology in specimens of the genus Ixodes.","['Animal Migration', 'Animals', 'Bird Diseases', 'Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale', 'Female', 'Ixodes', 'Male', 'Mite Infestations', 'Passeriformes', 'Poland']",22142944,"[['F01.145.113.069.500'], ['B01.050'], ['C22.131'], ['F04.711.513.653.083'], ['B01.050.500.131.166.132.832.400.425'], ['C01.610.858.211.480'], ['B01.050.150.900.248.620'], ['Z01.542.248.679']]","['Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Geographicals [Z]']",0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
Stimulation-dependent release of adenosine triphosphate from hippocampal slices.,"Schaffer collaterals of rat and mouse hippocampal slices were stimulated with bursts of pulses (300 Hz for 50 ms, 2-s intervals) for 30-s which caused a stable increase in the size of the population spike known as long-term potentiation. The release of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) was measured with a luciferase-luciferine system and the light emitted was recorded with a photomultiplier placed beneath a modified slice chamber. ATP release was observed shortly after the start of stimulation and was quantified by comparison with the response of standard solutions of ATP. No ATP release was observed in a Ca2+ free solution or after low frequency stimulation (1 Hz). Glutamate (2 mM), applied without electrical stimulation, did not evoke ATP release. Also, the glutamate receptor blocker, kynurenic acid (10 mM), did not block ATP release. It is concluded that ATP is released from electrically stimulated hippocampal slices from presynaptic nerve terminals in a calcium-dependent fashion and may play a role in the modulation of synaptic efficiency.","['Action Potentials', 'Adenosine Triphosphate', 'Animals', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Glutamates', 'Glutamic Acid', 'Hippocampus', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred Strains']",2566360,"[['G04.580.100', 'G07.265.675.100', 'G11.561.570.100'], ['D03.633.100.759.646.138.236', 'D13.695.667.138.236', 'D13.695.827.068.236'], ['B01.050'], ['E05.723.402'], ['D12.125.067.625', 'D12.125.119.409'], ['D12.125.067.625.349', 'D12.125.119.409.349', 'D12.125.427.300'], ['A08.186.211.180.405', 'A08.186.211.200.885.287.500.345'], ['E05.481'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500'], ['B01.050.050.199.520.520.420', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500.400.420'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700'], ['B01.050.050.199.520.760', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700.400']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

[Dose delivered to the patient by megavoltage cone beam computed tomography imaging].,"PURPOSE: To study the dose delivered by a megavoltage cone beam computed tomography imaging system (MVCBCT) installed on a Oncor Impression linac (Siemens).MATERIALS AND METHODS: The acquisition of MVCBCT images was modelled in a treatment planning system by 67 photon beams (6 MV). A study was conducted to: compare the calculated and measured dose at the centre of a cylindrical phantom; compare the calculated and measured dose distributions in the Alderson-Rando phantom (pelvis); study the influence of MVCBCT image acquisition for the repositioning of a prostate cancer patient treated by 3D conformal radiotherapy (prescribed dose of 74 Gy), on the dose-volume histograms (DVH) for the treatment plus seven MVCBCT (protocol D1-3 and weekly), treatment plus 37 MVCBCT (one for each day of treatment).RESULTS: The difference between calculated and measured doses at the centre of the cylindrical phantom was less than 3%. A deviation of 7% maximum was found between the dose distribution calculated in the Rando phantom and the measured doses normalized at the beam isocentre. The dose delivered at the isocentre was equal to 3,7 cGy for a ""5 MU"" protocol, with a maximum dose of 6 cGy. In the case of the patient considered, the acquisition of 37 MVCBCT corresponded to an additional mean dose to the PTV of 1.2 Gy for a protocol ""5MU"" with a significant influence on the DVH.CONCLUSION: In view of this study, it appears that the doses delivered in frequent use of MVCBCT must be taken into account by the radiation oncologist in assessing the therapeutic dose delivered to the target volume and organs at risk.","['Cone-Beam Computed Tomography', 'Femur Head', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Particle Accelerators', 'Pelvis', 'Phantoms, Imaging', 'Prostatic Neoplasms', 'Radiation Dosage', 'Radiotherapy, Conformal', 'Rectum', 'Urinary Bladder']",19640758,"[['E01.370.350.700.810.810.490', 'E01.370.350.825.810.810.399'], ['A02.835.232.043.150.343'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E07.710.680'], ['A01.923.600'], ['E07.671'], ['C04.588.945.440.770', 'C12.294.260.750', 'C12.294.565.625', 'C12.758.409.750'], ['E05.799.513', 'G01.750.740', 'N06.850.810.250'], ['E02.815.635.700', 'L01.313.500.750.100.710.600.550'], ['A03.556.124.526.767', 'A03.556.249.249.767'], ['A05.810.890']]","['Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Information Science [L]']",1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0

Immunohistochemical study of the pancreatic endocrine cells in the BALB/c mice: an unique distributional pattern of glucagon.,"The regional distribution and relative frequency of insulin-, glucagon-, somatostatin- and pancreatic polypeptide (PP)-producing endocrine cells in the pancreas of BALB/c mouse were investigated by immunohistochemical method. The pancreas of mice was divided into two portions; pancreatic islets and exocrine portions, and pancreatic islets were further subdivided into two regions (central and peripheral regions) and the relative frequency and regional distribution of immunoreactive cells against insulin, glucagon, somatostatin and PP antisera were monitored. In the pancreatic islet portions, insulin-immunoreactive cells were located in the central regions and they were randomly dispersed in the whole pancreatic islets in some case of the small islets. Quite different from those of other mammals, glucagon-immunoreactive cells were dispersed throughout central to peripheral regions in case of large islets and in the smaller ones, most of these cells were situated in the peripheral regions. Somatostatin-immunoreactive cells were detected in the peripheral regions with various frequencies. Although some cells were demonstrated in the central regions of pancreatic islets, most of PP-immunoreactive cells were located in the peripheral regions. In the exocrine portions, all four types of immunoreactive cells were demonstrated in the BALB/c mouse. Some peculiar distributional patterns of pancreatic endocrine cells were found in BALB/c mouse, especially in case of glucagon-immunoreactive cells.","['Animals', 'Female', 'Glucagon', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Insulin', 'Islets of Langerhans', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Pancreatic Polypeptide', 'Somatostatin']",12514327,"[['B01.050'], ['D06.472.699.587.730.500', 'D12.644.548.586.730.500'], ['E01.370.225.500.607.512', 'E01.370.225.750.551.512', 'E05.200.500.607.512', 'E05.200.750.551.512', 'E05.478.583', 'H01.158.100.656.234.512', 'H01.158.201.344.512', 'H01.158.201.486.512', 'H01.181.122.573.512', 'H01.181.122.605.512'], ['D06.472.699.587.200.500.625', 'D12.644.548.586.200.500.625'], ['A03.734.414', 'A06.300.414'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500'], ['B01.050.050.199.520.520.338', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500.400.338'], ['D06.472.699.587.700', 'D12.644.400.600', 'D12.644.548.586.700', 'D12.776.631.650.600'], ['D06.472.699.327.700.875', 'D06.472.699.587.780', 'D12.644.400.400.700.875', 'D12.644.548.365.700.875', 'D12.644.548.586.780', 'D12.776.631.650.405.700.875']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
The relative affinity of transferrin and albumin for zinc.,"The relative affinity of transferrin and albumin for zinc has been measured by competitive dialysis at a low zinc concentration in 0.15 M NaCl, 50 mM HEPES, 0.1 mM trisodium citrate (pH 7.2). There were small differences between albumins and larger ones between transferrin preparations, but all albumins bound zinc more firmly than any transferrin did. It is known that transferrin is largely responsible for the uptake of zinc from an intestinal membrane in rats, but much of the metal is subsequently transferred to albumin. The current results show that both in humans and in rats (a) no special mechanism is needed to provide energy for this transfer, and (b) full equilibration would lead to virtually complete transfer in contrast with what actually occurs in vivo.","['Humans', 'Osmolar Concentration', 'Protein Binding', 'Serum Albumin', 'Transferrin', 'Zinc']",518914,[],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Reduction in excess daytime sleepiness by modafinil in patients with myotonic dystrophy.,"Patients with myotonic dystrophy frequently suffer from excess daytime sleepiness, which can be a significant cause of disability. Previous studies have indicated that this excess daytime sleepiness is only occasionally due to obstructive sleep apnoea and may be principally of central nervous system origin. Modafinil has been successfully used to treat narcolepsy, a central disorder causing excess daytime sleepiness. We have investigated the use of this drug in myotonic dystrophy patients with excess daytime sleepiness. Patients were recruited from a clinic population on the basis of screening with the Epworth Sleepiness Scale. Patients scoring 10 and above were invited to participate in a randomized double-blind crossover trial of modafinil versus placebo, with four weeks in each arm of the study separated by a 2-week washout period. Patients were assessed by polysomnography at baseline. The primary outcome measures were change in both the Epworth Sleepiness Scale and a modified Maintenance of Wakefulness Test, which were measured at the start of each arm of the trial and in week 3 of each intervention period. In agreement with previous smaller studies, sleepiness is not correlated with CTG expansion size. Treatment with modafinil showed a non-significant reduction in median Epworth Sleepiness Scale. However, the median Maintenance of Wakefulness Test score was prolonged by treatment (31.7-40 min, P=0.006). There were no significant adverse cardiac effects of the drug in this group of patients (resting 12 lead and 24 h ECG monitoring). Selected patients with myotonic dystrophy and excess daytime sleepiness may benefit from modafinil. In this patient group the Epworth Sleepiness Scale may not be the most reliable measure of sleepiness. Despite the potential for cardiac disease in these patients, the drug was well tolerated with no adverse effects.","['Adult', 'Aged', 'Benzhydryl Compounds', 'Central Nervous System Stimulants', 'Cross-Over Studies', 'Disorders of Excessive Somnolence', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Modafinil', 'Myotonic Dystrophy', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'Polysomnography', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Treatment Outcome']",12798791,"[['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['D02.455.426.559.389.115'], ['D27.505.696.282', 'D27.505.954.427.220'], ['E05.318.370.150', 'N05.715.360.325.150', 'N06.850.520.445.150'], ['C10.886.425.800.200', 'F03.870.400.800.200'], ['E05.318.370.300', 'E05.581.500.300', 'N05.715.360.325.320', 'N06.850.520.445.300'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['D02.455.426.559.389.115.550'], ['C05.651.534.500.500', 'C05.651.662.750', 'C10.574.500.547', 'C10.668.491.175.500.500', 'C10.668.491.606.750', 'C16.320.400.542', 'C16.320.577.500'], ['F04.711.513'], ['E01.370.520.625'], ['E05.318.308.980', 'N05.715.360.300.800', 'N06.850.520.308.980'], ['E01.789.800', 'N04.761.559.590.800', 'N05.715.360.575.575.800']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Organisms [B]']",0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
Genotoxic capacity of Cd/Se semiconductor quantum dots with differing surface chemistries.,"Quantum dots (QD) have unique electronic and optical properties promoting biotechnological advances. However, our understanding of the toxicological structure-activity relationships remains limited. This study aimed to determine the biological impact of varying nanomaterial surface chemistry by assessing the interaction of QD with either a negative (carboxyl), neutral (hexadecylamine; HDA) or positive (amine) polymer coating with human lymphoblastoid TK6 cells. Following QD physico-chemical characterisation, cellular uptake was quantified by optical and electron microscopy. Cytotoxicity was evaluated and genotoxicity was characterised using the micronucleus assay (gross chromosomal damage) and the HPRT forward mutation assay (point mutagenicity). Cellular damage mechanisms were also explored, focusing on oxidative stress and mitochondrial damage. Cell uptake, cytotoxicity and genotoxicity were found to be dependent on QD surface chemistry. Carboxyl-QD demonstrated the smallest agglomerate size and greatest cellular uptake, which correlated with a dose dependent increase in cytotoxicity and genotoxicity. Amine-QD induced minimal cellular damage, while HDA-QD promoted substantial induction of cell death and genotoxicity. However, HDA-QD were not internalised by the cells and the damage they caused was most likely due to free cadmium release caused by QD dissolution. Oxidative stress and induced mitochondrial reactive oxygen species were only partially associated with cytotoxicity and genotoxicity induced by the QD, hence were not the only mechanisms of importance. Colloidal stability, nanoparticle (NP) surface chemistry, cellular uptake levels and the intrinsic characteristics of the NPs are therefore critical parameters impacting genotoxicity induced by QD.","['Cadmium', 'Cell Line', 'DNA Damage', 'Humans', 'Lymphocytes', 'Mutagenicity Tests', 'Mutagens', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Quantum Dots', 'Selenium', 'Semiconductors', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Surface Properties']",26275419,"[['D01.268.556.137', 'D01.268.956.061', 'D01.552.544.137'], ['A11.251.210'], ['G05.200'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['A11.118.637.555.567', 'A15.145.229.637.555.567', 'A15.382.490.555.567'], ['E05.393.560', 'E05.940.560'], ['D27.888.569.468'], ['G03.673', 'G07.775.750'], ['E07.705', 'J01.637.512.600.650'], ['D01.268.185.850', 'D01.578.700'], ['E07.305.625'], ['G02.111.830', 'G07.690.773.997'], ['G02.860']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
"Molecular pathways: microsatellite instability in colorectal cancer: prognostic, predictive, and therapeutic implications.","Microsatellite instability (MSI) is the molecular fingerprint of the deficient mismatch repair (MMR) system, which characterizes ?15% of colorectal cancers. MSI develops as a result of germline mutations in MMR genes or, more commonly, from epigenetic silencing of MLH1 in sporadic tumors occurring in a background of methylation of CpG islands in gene promoter regions and in tumors that frequently show hotspot mutations in the BRAF oncogene. MSI tumors have distinct phenotypic features and have been consistently associated with a better stage-adjusted prognosis compared with microsatellite stable tumors. MSI negatively predicts response to 5-fluorouracil and may also determine responsiveness to other drugs used for treatment of colorectal cancers. Recent data have expanded the molecular heterogeneity of MSI tumors and may contribute to our understanding of differential chemosensitivity. The ability to identify deficient MMR has important implications for patient management, and it holds promise for therapeutic exploitation and for the development of novel therapeutics.","['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Colorectal Neoplasms', 'CpG Islands', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Mismatch Repair', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Humans', 'MicroRNAs', 'Microsatellite Instability', 'MutL Protein Homolog 1', 'Mutation', 'Nuclear Proteins', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prognosis', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic']",22302899,"[['D12.644.360.024', 'D12.776.157.057', 'D12.776.476.024'], ['C04.588.274.476.411.307', 'C06.301.371.411.307', 'C06.405.249.411.307', 'C06.405.469.158.356', 'C06.405.469.491.307', 'C06.405.469.860.180'], ['G02.111.570.080.380.160', 'G05.360.080.380.160', 'G05.360.340.024.159'], ['G02.111.035.538.161', 'G02.111.218', 'G03.059.538.161', 'G05.206'], ['G02.111.222.220', 'G05.219.220'], ['G05.365.331'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D13.150.650.319', 'D13.444.735.150.319', 'D13.444.735.790.552.500'], ['C23.550.362.590', 'G05.365.590.335.590', 'G05.370.590'], ['D08.811.074.766.500', 'D08.811.277.040.025.215.500', 'D12.776.260.540.500'], ['G05.365.590'], ['D12.776.660'], ['E05.318.370.800.650', 'N05.715.360.325.700.640', 'N06.850.520.445.800.650'], ['E01.789'], ['G02.111.570.080.689.675', 'G05.360.080.689.675', 'G05.360.340.024.340.137.750.680']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
Physical and functional interaction of the Arabidopsis K(+) channel AKT2 and phosphatase AtPP2CA.,"The AKT2 K(+) channel is endowed with unique functional properties, being the only weak inward rectifier characterized to date in Arabidopsis. The gene is expressed widely, mainly in the phloem but also at lower levels in leaf epiderm, mesophyll, and guard cells. The AKT2 mRNA level is upregulated by abscisic acid. By screening a two-hybrid cDNA library, we isolated a protein phosphatase 2C (AtPP2CA) involved in abscisic acid signaling as a putative partner of AKT2. We further confirmed the interaction by in vitro binding studies. The expression of AtPP2CA (beta-glucuronidase reporter gene) displayed a pattern largely overlapping that of AKT2 and was upregulated by abscisic acid. Coexpression of AtPP2CA with AKT2 in COS cells and Xenopus laevis oocytes was found to induce both an inhibition of the AKT2 current and an increase of the channel inward rectification. Site-directed mutagenesis and pharmacological analysis revealed that this functional interaction involves AtPP2CA phosphatase activity. Regulation of AKT2 activity by AtPP2CA in planta could allow the control of K(+) transport and membrane polarization during stress situations.","['Abscisic Acid', 'Animals', 'Arabidopsis', 'Arabidopsis Proteins', 'COS Cells', 'DNA, Complementary', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Plant', 'Oocytes', 'Phosphoprotein Phosphatases', 'Plant Epidermis', 'Plant Proteins', 'Plant Roots', 'Plant Shoots', 'Potassium Channels', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Phosphatase 2', 'Protein Phosphatase 2C', 'RNA, Messenger', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins', 'Signal Transduction', 'Two-Hybrid System Techniques', 'Xenopus laevis']",12034902,"[['D02.241.223.268.034', 'D02.455.326.271.665.202.061', 'D02.455.426.392.368.367.379.249.024', 'D02.455.849.131.061', 'D02.455.849.765.521.500'], ['B01.050'], ['B01.650.940.800.575.912.250.157.100'], ['D12.776.765.149'], ['A11.251.210.172.500', 'A11.329.228.220'], ['D13.444.308.497.220', 'D13.444.600.223.500', 'D27.720.470.530.600.223.260'], ['G05.308.320'], ['G05.308.375'], ['A05.360.490.690.680', 'A11.497.497.600'], ['D08.811.277.352.650.625'], ['A18.024.750'], ['D12.776.765'], ['A18.400'], ['A18.024.875'], ['D12.776.157.530.400.600', 'D12.776.543.550.450.750', 'D12.776.543.585.400.750'], ['G02.111.679', 'G03.808'], ['D08.811.277.352.650.625.706', 'D12.644.360.583', 'D12.776.476.561'], ['D08.811.277.352.650.625.716'], ['D13.444.735.544'], ['D12.776.354.750'], ['G02.111.820', 'G04.835'], ['E05.393.220.870', 'E05.601.690.650', 'E05.601.870'], ['B01.050.150.900.090.180.610.500.562']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Detection of early retinal changes in diabetes by vitreous fluorophotometry.,"A series of 77 patients with overt diabetes and with apparently normal fundi on ophthalmoscopy and fluorescein angiography was examined by vitreous fluorophotometry. Breakdown of the blood-retinal barrier, which appears to be the earliest clinically detectable change in the retina in diabetes, was a constant finding. Quantitative measurement by vitreous fluorophotometry of the breakdown of the blood-retinal barrier could be correlated with degree of metabolic control and previous duration of diabetic disease. Significantly higher vitreous fluorophotometry values, indicating a more marked breakdown of the blood-retinal barrier, were recorded in patients under poor metabolic control than in patients whose diabetes was under relatively better control. Similarly, patients who has had diabetes for longer periods of time showed higher vitreous fluorophotometry values than those recorded in patients with diabetes of shorter duration.","['Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Female', 'Fluorometry', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Retina', 'Time Factors', 'Vitreous Body']",759246,[],[],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Transplant vasculopathy: viral anti-inflammatory serpin regulation of atherogenesis.,"BACKGROUND: Surgical and ischemic injury to the artery wall initiates vascular wound-healing responses that stimulate atherosclerotic plaque growth. The plasminogen activators have cellular chemotactic, adhesion, and proteolytic activity. Serp-1 is a secreted myxoma virus glycoprotein serpin that binds and inhibits plasminogen activators. We have examined the effects of Serp-1 on plaque growth and inflammatory cell invasion in animal models after balloon injury and after aortic allograft transplant.METHODS: We used histologic analysis to assess 4 animal models of angioplasty-mediated injury and 2 models of aortic allograft transplant for intimal hyperplasia and cellular invasion. We assessed plasminogen activator (uPA and tPA) and inhibitor (PAI-1) expression in rat iliofemoral arteries after balloon injury using Western blot, enzyme activity, and quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).RESULTS: Plaque growth after balloon injury decreased after Serp-1 treatment in all balloon-injury models tested. Transplant vasculopathy also significantly decreased in 2 rat models of aortic allograft transplant. Infusion of a Serp-1 active site mutant, that lacked plasminogen activator inhibiting activity, did not inhibit plaque growth. Quantitative RT-PCR detected increased transcription of PAI-1 mRNA. Increased PAI-1 protein and enzyme-inhibitory activity was also detected in Serp-1-treated arteries by activity assay and Western blot.CONCLUSIONS: Thrombolytic serpins are central regulatory agents in vascular wound-healing responses. Investigation of the inhibitory mechanisms of viral serpins may provide new insights into atherogenesis.","['Angioplasty, Balloon', 'Animals', 'Aorta', 'Arteriosclerosis', 'Chickens', 'Coronary Artery Disease', 'Female', 'Heart Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Plasminogen Activators', 'Postoperative Complications', 'Rabbits', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Serpins', 'Swine', 'Swine, Miniature', 'Tunica Intima', 'Tunica Media', 'Wound Healing']",11077219,"[['E02.148.050.060', 'E04.100.814.529.124.060', 'E04.502.382.124.060', 'E05.157.016.060'], ['B01.050'], ['A07.015.114.056'], ['C14.907.137.126'], ['B01.050.150.900.248.350.150', 'B01.050.150.900.248.690.192'], ['C14.280.647.250.260', 'C14.907.137.126.339', 'C14.907.585.250.260'], ['E04.100.376.475', 'E04.928.220.390', 'E04.936.450.475'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D08.811.277.656.300.760.635', 'D08.811.277.656.959.350.635', 'D12.776.124.125.662'], ['C23.550.767'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.968.700'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700.750'], ['D12.644.861', 'D12.776.872', 'D27.505.519.389.745.800.675'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.500.880'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.500.880.399.800'], ['A07.015.700'], ['A07.015.733'], ['G16.762.891']]","['Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Effects of water-soluble low-molecular-weight beta-1, 3-D-glucan (branch beta-1, 6) isolated from Aureobasidium pullulans 1A1 strain black yeast on restraint stress in mice.","It is well known that different stress paradigms are able to rapidly induce corticosterone production and immune function through the activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. It has been reported that glucocorticoids suppress natural killer (NK) activity and interleukin (IL)-1 production and, on the other hand, that IL-1 and IL-6 stimulate the release of corticotrophin-releasing-hormone from the rat hypothalamus. Moreover, it has been reported that IL-12 plays a central role in the initiation of cell-mediated immunity, directly and via its induction of interferon (IFN)-gamma and activation of NK cells. In this study, we examined the effects of water-soluble low-molecular-weight beta-glucan isolated from Aureobasidium pullulans 1A1 strain on the corticosterone levels and immune function, such as NK activity and IL-6 and IL-12 production, using a restraint stress-induced mouse model. The water-soluble low-molecular-weight beta-glucan at a dose of 50 or 100 mg kg(-1) inhibited the increases in the blood corticosterone level and the reduction of NK activity induced by restraint stress. Furthermore, the water-soluble low-molecular-weight beta-glucan (100 mg kg(-1)) prevented the reduction of IL-6 and IL-12 production by splenocytes caused by restraint stress. These findings suggest that the inhibitory actions of water-soluble low-molecular-weight beta-glucan on the increase in corticosterone level and reduction of NK activity induced by restraint stress may be associated with the abrogation of the IL-6 and IL-12 reduction caused by the stress. Thus, water-soluble low-molecularweight beta-glucan may be an effective dietary supplement for the prevention of stress.","['Animals', 'Ascomycota', 'Corticosterone', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Glucans', 'Interleukin-12', 'Interleukin-6', 'Killer Cells, Natural', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Organ Size', 'Restraint, Physical', 'Spleen', 'Stress, Psychological']",17725857,"[['B01.050'], ['B01.300.107'], ['D04.210.500.745.745.654.237', 'D06.472.040.585.353.237'], ['G07.690.773.875', 'G07.690.936.500'], ['D05.750.078.562', 'D09.698.365'], ['D12.644.276.374.465.512', 'D12.776.467.374.465.512', 'D23.529.374.465.512'], ['D12.644.276.374.465.224', 'D12.776.467.374.465.202', 'D23.529.374.465.224'], ['A11.118.637.555.567.537', 'A15.145.229.637.555.567.537', 'A15.382.490.555.567.537'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500'], ['B01.050.050.199.520.520.338', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500.400.338'], ['E01.370.600.115.100.660', 'E05.041.124.715', 'G07.100.100.660', 'G07.345.249.690'], ['E02.085.700', 'E05.472.760'], ['A10.549.700', 'A15.382.520.604.700'], ['F01.145.126.990', 'F02.830.900']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]']",1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Ratio of urinary potassium to urinary sodium and the potassium and edema status in nephrotic syndrome.,"OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the relevance of ratios of urinary potassium to urinary sodium + potassium (U(K)/U(Na + K)) to edema status in minimal-change nephrotic syndrome (MCNS).METHODS: We retrospectively studied 26 adults with newly diagnosed MCNS with significant pitting edema. On the basis of mean value (0.46±0.21) of U(K)/U(Na + K) determined from spot urine samples on admission, patients were classified into 2 groups.RESULTS: On admission, 12 of 26 patients had U(K)/U(Na + K) >0.46 (0.65±0.16, Group H), 14 patients had U(K)/U(Na + K) <0.46 (0.29±0.08, Group L). The level of serum albumin was similarly decreased in these 2 groups. Noteworthy were lower urine volume, fractional excretion of sodium (FENa), serum sodium, and higher hematocrit in the group H as compared with the group L. The group H had a shorter mean time required from onset of edema to hospitalization, and tended to have a longer mean time to complete remission than group L. High U(K)/U(Na + K) levels in group H decreased significantly after remission, eventually becoming equal to those of group L (0.24±0.05 vs. 0.25±0.05).CONCLUSION: U(K)/U(Na + K) determined from spot urine sample on admission relates to laboratory or clinical indices to distinguish edema status in adult patients with MCNS.","['Adult', 'Biomarkers', 'Edema', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nephrotic Syndrome', 'Patient Admission', 'Potassium', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sodium']",21422677,"[['M01.060.116'], ['D23.101'], ['C23.888.277'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['C12.777.419.630.643', 'C13.351.968.419.630.643'], ['E02.760.400.600', 'N02.421.585.400.600'], ['D01.268.549.550', 'D01.268.557.575', 'D01.552.528.652', 'D01.552.547.650'], ['E05.318.372.500.500.500', 'E05.318.372.500.750.750', 'N05.715.360.330.500.500.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.825', 'N06.850.520.450.500.500.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.825'], ['D01.268.549.750', 'D01.268.557.650', 'D01.552.528.850', 'D01.552.547.725']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
The PVT gene frequently amplifies with MYC in tumor cells.,"The line of human colon carcinoma cells known as COLO320-DM contains an amplified and abnormal allele of the proto-oncogene MYC (DMMYC). Exon 1 and most of intron 1 of MYC have been displaced from DMMYC by a rearrangement of DNA. The RNA transcribed from DMMYC is a chimera that begins with an ectopic sequence of 176 nucleotides and then continues with exons 2 and 3 of MYC. The template for the ectopic sequence represents exon 1 of a gene known as PVT, which lies 50 kilobase pairs downstream of MYC. We encountered three abnormal configurations of MYC and PVT in the cell lines analyzed here: (i) amplification of the genes, accompanied by insertion of exon 1 and an undetermined additional portion of PVT within intron 1 of MYC to create DMMYC; (ii) selective deletion of exon 1 of PVT from amplified DNA that contains downstream portions of PVT and an intact allele of MYC; and (iii) coamplification of MYC and exon 1 of PVT, but not of downstream portions of PVT. We conclude that part or all of PVT is frequently amplified with MYC and that intron 1 of PVT represents a preferred boundary for amplification affecting MYC.","['Alleles', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Chimera', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Colonic Neoplasms', 'DNA', 'Exons', 'Gene Amplification', 'Humans', 'Introns', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oncogenes', 'RNA, Neoplasm', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2725491,"[['G05.360.340.024.340.030'], ['B01.050'], ['G02.111.570.080', 'G05.360.080', 'L01.453.245.667.080'], ['B05.200'], ['E05.393.220'], ['C04.588.274.476.411.307.180', 'C06.301.371.411.307.180', 'C06.405.249.411.307.180', 'C06.405.469.158.356.180', 'C06.405.469.491.307.180'], ['D13.444.308'], ['G05.360.340.024.340.137.232'], ['G05.308.250', 'G05.365.590.310', 'G05.558.315'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['G05.360.340.024.220.400', 'G05.360.340.024.340.137.515'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500'], ['L01.453.245.667'], ['G05.360.340.024.340.375.500'], ['D13.444.735.615'], ['G02.111.873', 'G05.297.700'], ['A11.251.860']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
"Bonnevillamides, Linear Heptapeptides Isolated from a Great Salt Lake-Derived Streptomyces sp.","Streptomyces sp.

Moreover, in bonnevillamide A, the terminal proline residue found in bonnevillamides B and C is replaced with 4-methyl-azetidine-2-carboxylic acid methyl ester. The structures of the three heptapeptides were elucidated by NMR, high-resolution electrospray ionization mass spectroscopy (HRESIMS), and LC-MS/MS, and the absolute configuration of all proteinogenic amino acid residues were determined by advanced Marfey's method.

According to their minimum inhibitory concentrations, four strains (Ent. faecium, Lact. reuteri, Lact. amylovorus, Bif. thermophilum) were susceptible to all clinically relevant antibiotics. Two lactobacilli showing multiresistance harboured the erm(B) determinant. A cross-section of eight representative strains was examined for growth suppression of two strains of Brach. hyodysenteriae, the aetiological agent of swine dysentery, and compared with intestinal strains derived from other animal sources. The Brachyspira strains were inhibited by strains of Lact. salivarius, Bif. thermophilum, Ent. faecium and B. subtilis.CONCLUSIONS: Three porcine strains of Ent. faecium, Bif. thermophilum and B. subtilis were found to be suitable as probiotic candidates because of their well-established identity, antibiotic susceptibility and antagonistic activity.SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: For the first time, antagonistic activity of well-characterized porcine strains against Brach. hyodysenteriae is presented. These findings suggest that certain intestinal strains might have a potential as probiotic feed additives for prevention of swine dysentery.","['Animals', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Bacteria', 'Brachyspira hyodysenteriae', 'DNA, Ribosomal', 'Gastrointestinal Tract', 'Gram-Negative Bacterial Infections', 'Microbial Interactions', 'Microbial Sensitivity Tests', 'Phylogeny', 'Probiotics', 'Swine', 'Swine Diseases']",19778354,"[['B01.050'], ['D27.505.954.122.085'], ['B03'], ['B03.440.097.100', 'B03.440.425.410.220.100'], ['D13.444.308.475'], ['A03.556'], ['C01.150.252.400'], ['G06.550'], ['E01.370.225.875.595', 'E05.200.875.595', 'E05.337.550.400'], ['G05.697', 'G16.075.605', 'L01.100.697'], ['G07.203.300.456.500', 'J02.500.456.500'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.500.880'], ['C22.905']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0
Development of language in Rett syndrome.,"Ninety-nine cases of Rett syndrome (RTT) diagnosed clinically (age range 3 years 6 months to 29 years 9 months) were evaluated for the ability of language. The presence of meaningful words, vocabularies, and ages at the start and disappearance of speech were assessed. Phenotype/genotype correlation was evaluated in 22 cases in whom mutations of the genes of methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MECP2) existed. Fifty-five cases (55.5%) could speak some words, and of them eight cases (14.5%) spoke two-word sentences. No case had more than 40 words. The vocabularies were mainly bilabial words, known as the characteristics of the initial words in normal children. They began to utter a word between 12 and 48 months, and most of them (85.4%) before 20 months. Those who spoke two-word sentence(s) began to utter a word earlier (10.4+/-3.7 months) than others (17.1+/-9.8 months). Thirty-three cases lost their word(s) in 12-36 months. Among 22 gene-proven cases two cases with mutation of R133C and two cases with R294X had word(s), but another two cases with T158M had not. In RTT a delay in the neuronal systems involved in normal speech development was suggested and its severity seemed to depend on the loci of mutation.","['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aging', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Language Development Disorders', 'Methyl-CpG-Binding Protein 2', 'Middle Aged', 'Repressor Proteins', 'Rett Syndrome', 'Speech']",11738880,"[['M01.060.057'], ['M01.060.116'], ['G07.345.124'], ['M01.060.406'], ['M01.060.406.448'], ['D12.776.660.235', 'D12.776.664.235'], ['E05.393.760.700.300'], ['D12.776.260'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C10.597.606.150.500.550', 'C23.888.592.604.150.500.550'], ['D12.776.260.536', 'D12.776.660.235.550', 'D12.776.664.235.700'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['D12.776.260.703', 'D12.776.930.780'], ['C10.597.606.360.455.937', 'C16.320.322.500.937', 'C16.320.400.525.937'], ['F01.145.209.908.677', 'G11.561.812', 'L01.559.423.676']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Information Science [L]']",0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0
Right and left perisylvian cortex and left inferior frontal cortex mediate sentence-level rhyme detection in spoken language as revealed by sparse fMRI.,"In this study, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate the neural basis of auditory rhyme processing at the sentence level in healthy adults. In an explicit rhyme detection task, participants were required to decide whether the ending syllable of a metrically spoken pseudosentence rhymed or not. Participants performing this task revealed bilateral activation in posterior-superior temporal gyri with a much more extended cluster of activation in the right hemisphere. These findings suggest that the right hemisphere primarily supports suprasegmental tasks, such as the segmentation of speech into syllables; thus, our findings are in line with the ""asymmetric sampling in time"" model suggested by Poeppel (: Speech Commun 41:245-255). The direct contrast between rhymed and nonrhymed trials revealed a stronger BOLD response for rhymed trials in the frontal operculum and the anterior insula of the left hemisphere. Our results suggest an involvement of these frontal regions not only in articulatory rehearsal processes, but especially in the detection of a matching syllable, as well as in the execution of rhyme judgment.","['Adult', 'Auditory Perception', 'Brain Mapping', 'Cerebral Cortex', 'Female', 'Functional Laterality', 'Humans', 'Image Processing, Computer-Assisted', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Male', 'Oxygen', 'Semantics', 'Signal Detection, Psychological', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Young Adult']",22711328,"[['M01.060.116'], ['F02.463.593.071', 'G07.888.125'], ['E01.370.350.578.875.500', 'E01.370.376.537.625.500', 'E05.629.875.500'], ['A08.186.211.200.885.287.500'], ['F02.830.297.425', 'G11.561.225.425'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['L01.224.308'], ['E01.370.350.825.500'], ['D01.268.185.550', 'D01.362.670'], ['L01.559.598.745'], ['E01.370.685.814', 'E05.796.908', 'F02.463.593.257.800', 'F02.463.593.710.725', 'F04.096.753.814', 'F04.669.908'], ['E05.318.308.980', 'N05.715.360.300.800', 'N06.850.520.308.980'], ['M01.060.116.815']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Health Care [N]']",1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0

Vimentin participates in microglia activation and neurotoxicity in cerebral ischemia.,"Microglia are the 'immune cells' of the brain and their activation plays a vital role in the pathogenesis of many neurodegenerative diseases. Activated microglia produce high levels of pro-inflammatory factors, such as TNFá, causing neurotoxicity. Here we show that vimentin played a key role in controlling microglia activation and neurotoxicity during cerebral ischemia. Deletion of vimentin expression significantly impaired microglia activation in response to LPS in vitro and transient focal cerebral ischemia in vivo. Reintroduction of the functional vimentin gene back into vimentin knockout microglia restored their response to LPS. More importantly, impairment of microglia activation significantly protected brain from cerebral ischemia-induced neurotoxicity. Collectively, we demonstrate a previously unknown function of vimentin in controlling microglia activation.","['Animals', 'Blotting, Western', 'Brain', 'Brain Ischemia', 'Cell Separation', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique, Indirect', 'Image Processing, Computer-Assisted', 'In Situ Nick-End Labeling', 'Infarction, Middle Cerebral Artery', 'Ischemic Attack, Transient', 'Lipopolysaccharides', 'Macrophage Activation', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Microglia', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Nervous System Diseases', 'Plasmids', 'Reperfusion Injury', 'Tetracycline', 'Vimentin']",22681613,"[['B01.050'], ['E05.196.401.143', 'E05.301.300.096', 'E05.478.566.320.200', 'E05.601.262', 'E05.601.470.320.200'], ['A08.186.211'], ['C10.228.140.300.150', 'C14.907.253.092'], ['E01.370.225.500.363', 'E05.200.500.363', 'E05.242.363'], ['E01.370.225.500.607.512.240.310', 'E01.370.225.750.551.512.240.310', 'E05.200.500.607.512.240.310', 'E05.200.750.551.512.240.310', 'E05.478.583.375.310'], ['L01.224.308'], ['E05.393.475'], ['C10.228.140.300.150.477.200.450', 'C10.228.140.300.510.200.387', 'C10.228.140.300.775.200.200.450', 'C14.907.253.092.477.200.450', 'C14.907.253.560.200.387', 'C14.907.253.855.200.200.450', 'C23.550.513.355.250.200.450', 'C23.550.717.489.250.200.450'], ['C10.228.140.300.150.836', 'C14.907.253.092.836'], ['D09.400.500', 'D09.698.718.450', 'D10.494', 'D23.050.161.616.525', 'D23.946.123.329.500'], ['G12.287.500'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500'], ['B01.050.050.199.520.520.420', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500.400.420'], ['B01.050.050.136.500.500', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500.550.455', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500.800.500'], ['A08.637.400', 'A11.650.400'], ['E01.370.350.515.395', 'E05.595.395'], ['C10'], ['G05.360.600'], ['C14.907.725', 'C23.550.767.877'], ['D02.455.426.559.847.562.900.875', 'D04.615.562.900.875'], ['D05.750.078.593.900', 'D12.776.220.475.900']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
Cotton fiber annexins: a potential role in the regulation of callose synthase.,"Cotton fibers contain a characteristic set of proteins which interact with plasma membranes in a Ca(2+)-dependent manner. The association of these proteins with the membrane is correlated with a reduced level of UDP-glucose: (1-->3)-beta-glucan (callose) synthase activity. Analysis of the proteins released from membranes by EDTA treatment shows that the most abundant proteins comprise a family of at least three polypeptides (p34) which resemble annexins. This resemblance includes similarity in size (about 34 kDa), sequence homology, Ca(2+)-dependent precipitation or interaction with the plasma membrane, and ability to serve as a substrate for phosphorylation by endogenous protein kinase(s) which also bind to the membranes in a Ca(2+)-dependent manner. A purified fraction of these annexins binds to, and inhibits, the activity of a partially purified cotton fiber callose synthase. These findings suggest that one possible function of annexin(s) in plants is to modulate the activity and/or localization of callose synthase.","['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Annexins', 'Calcium', 'Cations, Divalent', 'Cell Membrane', 'Edetic Acid', 'Egtazic Acid', 'Glucosyltransferases', 'Gossypium', 'Membrane Proteins', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Plant Proteins', 'Protein Kinases', 'Schizosaccharomyces pombe Proteins']",8401609,"[['G02.111.570.060', 'L01.453.245.667.060'], ['D12.776.157.125.050'], ['D01.268.552.100', 'D01.552.539.288', 'D23.119.100'], ['D01.248.497.300.333'], ['A11.284.149'], ['D02.092.782.258.368.250', 'D02.241.081.018.253'], ['D02.092.782.258.368.257', 'D02.241.081.018.269'], ['D08.811.913.400.450.460'], ['B01.650.940.800.575.912.250.859.821.500.244'], ['D12.776.543'], ['L01.453.245.667'], ['D12.776.765'], ['D08.811.913.696.620.682'], ['D12.776.354.875']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Organisms [B]']",1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
"""Alpha chain disease"" protein def: internal deletion of a human immunoglobulin A1 heavy chain.","Protein Def is a human alpha chain disease protein related to alpha1 immunoglobulin heavy chain. The molecular weight of the polypeptide portion of the monomeric molecule is 29,300, which is a little greater than half of a normal alpha1 chain. The NH(2)-terminal of the polypeptide is heterogenous and, after a short segment corresponding to the variable region, displays a gap which comprises the C(H)1 constant domain. Normal synthesis resumes at a valine residue in the hinge region just before a segment which contains a partially duplicated fragment and the interheavy disulfide bonds. From there on, the molecule is apparently normal. Protein Def is therefore synthesized as an internally deleted alpha1 heavy chain, followed by postsynthetic amino-terminal proteolysis. It is postulated that codon(s) specifying valine at the hinge region may be a recognition site for reinitiating synthesis after internal gaps equivalent to position 216 in gamma chain disease proteins.","['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Chromatography, Gel', 'Electrophoresis, Paper', 'Heavy Chain Disease', 'Humans', 'Hydrolysis', 'Immunoglobulin Fragments', 'Molecular Weight', 'Pepsin A', 'Peptides', 'Subtilisins', 'Trypsin']",4595579,"[['G02.111.570.060', 'L01.453.245.667.060'], ['E05.196.181.400.250'], ['E05.196.401.319', 'E05.301.300.236'], ['C15.378.147.780.490', 'C15.604.515.435', 'C20.683.780.490'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['G02.380'], ['D12.644.541.500', 'D12.776.124.486.485.680', 'D12.776.124.790.651.680', 'D12.776.377.715.548.680'], ['G02.494'], ['D08.811.277.656.074.500.700', 'D08.811.277.656.300.048.700'], ['D12.644'], ['D08.811.277.656.300.760.787', 'D08.811.277.656.959.350.787'], ['D08.811.277.656.300.760.895', 'D08.811.277.656.959.350.895']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
Intraoperative radiation therapy (IORT) for previously untreated malignant gliomas.,"BACKGROUND: Intraoperative radiation therapy (IORT) is one of the methods used to deliver a large single dose to the tumor tissue while reducing the exposure of normal surrounding tissue. However, the usefulness of intraoperative electron therapy for malignant gliomas has not been established.METHODS: During the period from 1987 to 1997, 32 patients with malignant gliomas were treated with IORT. The histological diagnoses were anaplastic astrocytoma in 11 patients and glioblastoma in 21 patients. Therapy consisted of surgical resection and intraoperative electron therapy using a dose of 12--15 Gy (median, 15 Gy). The patients later underwent postoperative external radiation therapy (EXRT) with a median total dose of 60 Gy. Each of the 32 patients treated with IORT was randomly matched with patients who had been treated with postoperative EXRT alone (control). Patients were matched according to histological grade, age, extent of tumor removal, and tumor location.RESULTS: In the anaplastic astrocytoma group, the one-, two- and five-year survival rates were 81%, 51% and 15%, respectively in the IORT patients and 54%, 43% and 21%, respectively in the control patients. In the glioblastoma group, one-, two- and five-year survival rates were 63%, 26% and 0%, respectively in the IORT patients and 70%, 18% and 6%, respectively in the control patients. There was no significant difference between survival rates in the IORT patients and control patients in either the anaplastic astrocytoma group or glioblastoma group.CONCLUSIONS: IORT dose not improve survival of patients with malignant gliomas compared to that of patients who have received EXRT alone.","['Adult', 'Aged', 'Astrocytoma', 'Beta Particles', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Central Nervous System Neoplasms', 'Female', 'Frontal Lobe', 'Glioblastoma', 'Glioma', 'Humans', 'Intraoperative Period', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Occipital Lobe', 'Parietal Lobe', 'Postoperative Care', 'Radiotherapy Dosage', 'Survival Rate', 'Temporal Lobe']",11818027,"[['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['C04.557.465.625.600.380.080', 'C04.557.470.670.380.080', 'C04.557.580.625.600.380.080'], ['G01.750.750.125'], ['C04.588.614.250.195', 'C10.228.140.211', 'C10.551.240.250'], ['C04.588.614.250', 'C10.551.240'], ['A08.186.211.200.885.287.500.270'], ['C04.557.465.625.600.380.080.335', 'C04.557.470.670.380.080.335', 'C04.557.580.625.600.380.080.335'], ['C04.557.465.625.600.380', 'C04.557.470.670.380', 'C04.557.580.625.600.380'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E04.614.374', 'N02.421.585.753.374'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['A08.186.211.200.885.287.500.571'], ['A08.186.211.200.885.287.500.670'], ['E02.760.731.700', 'E04.604.500', 'N02.421.585.722.700'], ['E02.815.639'], ['E05.318.308.985.550.900', 'N01.224.935.698.826', 'N06.850.505.400.975.550.900', 'N06.850.520.308.985.550.900'], ['A08.186.211.200.885.287.500.863']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]']",1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
Hormonal and Physiological Adaptations to High-Intensity Interval Training in Professional Male Canoe Polo Athletes.,"This study compared the effects of 2 different high-intensity interval training (HIIT) programs in professional male canoe polo athletes.

High-intensity interval training resulted in significant (except as shown) increases compared with pretest, in VO2peak (G1 = +8.8% and G2 = +8.5%), heart rate at VT (b·min) (G1 = +9.7% and G2 = +5.9%) and (%maximum) (G1 = +6.9%; p = 0.29 and G2 = +6.5%), PPO (G1 = +9.7% and G2 = +12.2%), MPO (G1 = +11.1%; p = 0.29 and G2 = +16.2%), total testosterone (G1 = +29.4% and G2 = +16.7%), total testosterone/cortisol ratio (G1 = +40.9% and G2 = +28.1%), and mean corpuscular hemoglobin (G1 = +1.7% and G2 = +1.3%).

Streptococcus pneumoniae-associated human macrophage apoptosis after bacterial internalization via complement and Fcgamma receptors correlates with intracellular bacterial load.,"Opsonization enhances Streptococcus pneumoniae-induced human monocyte-derived macrophage (MDM) apoptosis. Both depletion of complement and immunoglobulin from opsonizing serum and blockade of the macrophages CR1, CR3, FcgammaRII, and FcgammaRIII partially decreased MDM apoptosis after S. pneumoniae phagocytosis, and these effects correlated with reduced numbers of internalized bacteria. Chloramphenicol inhibition of protein synthesis by opsonized S. pneumoniae down-regulated subsequent MDM apoptosis. Phagocytosis of an unencapsulated mutant of S. pneumoniae resulted in increased MDM apoptosis, in association with enhanced internalization. Caspase inhibition was associated with decreased killing of bacteria. Enhanced induction of apoptosis by opsonized S. pneumoniae is the result of increased intracellular burden of bacteria, rather than of a specific pattern of engagement of complement receptor or FcgammaR. A dynamic interaction between live intracellular bacteria and the host cell is necessary for induction of apoptosis in MDMs, and induction of apoptosis contributes to the host defense against S. pneumoniae.","['Apoptosis', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Macrophage Activation', 'Macrophages', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Monocytes', 'Opsonin Proteins', 'Phagocytosis', 'Pneumonia, Pneumococcal', 'Receptors, Complement', 'Receptors, IgG', 'Streptococcus pneumoniae']",14551881,"[['G04.146.954.035'], ['E01.370.225.500.363.342', 'E01.370.225.500.386.350', 'E05.196.712.516.600.240.350', 'E05.200.500.363.342', 'E05.200.500.386.350', 'E05.242.363.342', 'E05.242.386.350'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['G12.287.500'], ['A11.329.372', 'A11.627.482', 'A11.733.397', 'A15.382.670.522', 'A15.382.680.397'], ['E01.370.350.515.458', 'E05.595.458'], ['A11.118.637.555.652', 'A11.148.580', 'A11.627.624', 'A11.733.547', 'A15.145.229.637.555.652', 'A15.378.316.580', 'A15.382.490.555.652', 'A15.382.670.547', 'A15.382.680.547'], ['D12.776.124.486.485.114.767', 'D12.776.124.486.657', 'D12.776.124.790.651.114.767', 'D12.776.377.715.548.114.767'], ['G04.417.350', 'G09.188.665', 'G12.450.564.809', 'G12.688'], ['C01.150.252.410.890.670.750', 'C01.150.252.620.550', 'C01.748.610.540.550', 'C08.381.677.540.550', 'C08.730.610.540.550'], ['D12.776.543.750.705.833'], ['D12.776.543.750.705.871.300'], ['B03.353.750.737.872.550', 'B03.510.400.800.872.550', 'B03.510.550.737.872.550']]","['Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Diseases [C]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Assessment of metal pollution in Onsan Bay, Korea using Asian periwinkle Littorina brevicula as a biomonitor.","Cadmium (Cd), lead (Pb), copper (Cu) and zinc (Zn) concentrations in the marine gastropod, Littorina brevicula Philippi, were determined to assess the metal pollution in Onsan Bay, Korea. Samples of L. brevicula employed as a biomonitor and seawater were collected from 12 to 20 stations of Onsan Bay in November 1997, respectively. Dissolved metal concentrations in surface seawater were highest at the station near Onsan Non-ferrous Industrial Complex: 1.15 micrograms l-1 for Cd, 2.49 micrograms l-1 for Pb, 3.75 micrograms l-1 for Cu and 23.98 micrograms l-1 for Zn. These values were 1-2 orders higher than those shown at outer regions of the Bay. Metal concentrations in the soft body of periwinkles were highly variable at different sampling locations: 0.48-27.11 micrograms g-1 for Cd, 1.41-24.91 micrograms g-1 for Pb, 57-664 micrograms g-1 for Cu and 83-246 micrograms g-1 for Zn. The values from stations near the industrial complex were higher than those expected from relationships between body sizes and metal body burdens in periwinkles collected from the whole Korean coast. Spatial distribution of metal concentrations in the periwinkle and seawater indicated that Onsan industrial complex near the Bay is the input source of these metals. Especially, Cd and Pb concentrations in the periwinkle and seawater were distinctly decreased with distance from the Onsan industrial complex. Non-essential metals such as Cd and Pb in the periwinkle showed a strong correlation with dissolved metal concentrations in seawater. Conversely, essential Cu and Zn in the periwinkle were hardly explained by those in seawater, except at the most contaminated sites.","['Animals', 'Body Burden', 'Cadmium', 'Copper', 'Environmental Monitoring', 'Fresh Water', 'Korea', 'Lead', 'Metals, Heavy', 'Mollusca', 'Seawater', 'Water Pollutants, Chemical', 'Zinc']",10507153,"[['B01.050'], ['E05.799.638.231', 'N06.850.460.200'], ['D01.268.556.137', 'D01.268.956.061', 'D01.552.544.137'], ['D01.268.556.195', 'D01.268.956.170', 'D01.552.544.195'], ['N06.850.460.350.080', 'N06.850.780.375'], ['G16.500.275.280', 'N06.230.232'], ['Z01.252.474.557', 'Z01.586.407'], ['D01.268.556.435', 'D01.552.544.435'], ['D01.268.556', 'D01.552.544'], ['B01.050.500.644'], ['G16.500.275.725.500'], ['D27.888.284.903.655'], ['D01.268.556.940', 'D01.268.956.906', 'D01.552.544.940']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Geographicals [Z]']",0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1
"Non-peptidic inhibitors of human chymase. Synthesis, structure-activity relationships, and pharmacokinetic profiles of a series of 5-amino-6-oxo-1,6-dihydropyrimidine-containing trifluoromethyl ketones.","Chymase possesses a wide variety of actions, including promotion of angiotensin II production and histamine release from mast cells. However, due to a lack of effective inhibitors featuring both high inhibitory activity and high metabolic stability, the pathophysiological role of chymase has not been fully elucidated. We designed non-peptidic inhibitors based on the predicted binding mode of the peptidic chymase inhibitor Val-Pro-Phe-CF3 and demonstrated that the Val-Pro unit is replaceable with a (5-amino-6-oxo-2-phenyl-1,6-dihydro-1-pyrimidinyl)acetyl moiety. Structure-activity relationship studies revealed that phenyl substitution at the 2-position of the pyrimidinone ring is indispensable for high activity. The most potent compound 1h (Ki = 0.0506 microM) is superior in potency to the parent peptidic inhibitor Val-Pro-Phe-CF3 and has good selectivity for chymase over other proteases. The related analogue 1e was orally absorbed and maintained high plasma levels for at least 2h. These results suggest that the derivatives reported here could be developed as agents for treatment of chymase-induced disease.","['Animals', 'Biological Availability', 'Cattle', 'Chymases', 'Combinatorial Chemistry Techniques', 'Humans', 'Ketones', 'Kinetics', 'Pyrimidines', 'Rats', 'Serine Endopeptidases', 'Serine Proteinase Inhibitors', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",11249123,"[['B01.050'], ['G03.787.151', 'G07.690.725.129'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.500.380.271'], ['D08.811.277.656.300.760.103', 'D08.811.277.656.959.350.103'], ['E05.197.312', 'J01.897.836.249.249'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D02.522'], ['G01.374.661', 'G02.111.490'], ['D03.383.742'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700'], ['D08.811.277.656.300.760', 'D08.811.277.656.959.350'], ['D27.505.519.389.745.800'], ['G02.111.830', 'G07.690.773.997']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]']",0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
Sex differences in small-magnitude heart-rate responses to sexual and infant-related stimuli: a psychophysiological approach.,"Small-magnitude (2-3 beats per minute) heart-rate responses can show sex differences if assessed with a psychophysiological approach in which temporally fine-grained methods are used to determine topographical differences. Such differences emerged when 15 males and 37 females were shown videosegments depicting emotional scenes. Specifically, males accelerated to erotic segments (couples making love), while females accelerated to segments showing babies crying. In addition, the peak development of baby-cry-elicited accelerations occurred about 1 second before that of erotic segment-elicited accelerations. The results are consistent with a preparatory-response interpretation, but more research is needed both to investigate the generality of these sex differences in heart-rate responses, and to determine the role of experiential and psychosocial factors.","['Adult', 'Erotica', 'Female', 'Heart Rate', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Photic Stimulation', 'Psychophysiology', 'Sex Factors']",2629003,"[['M01.060.116'], ['K01.517.414', 'L01.178.682.441'], ['E01.370.600.875.500', 'G09.330.380.500'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.703'], ['E05.723.729'], ['E02.190.525.812', 'F02.830', 'F04.096.795', 'H01.158.782.795'], ['N05.715.350.675', 'N06.850.490.875']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Humanities [K]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]', 'Health Care [N]']",0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0
Surface electrocardiographic characteristics of right and left atrial flutter.,"BACKGROUND: There is little information about the surface expression of non-cavotricuspid isthmus (CTI)-dependent right atrial (RA) or left atrial (LA) flutter circuits.METHODS AND RESULTS: We retrospectively evaluated 32 episodes (in 26 patients) of atypical RA and 22 episodes (in 21 patients) of LA flutter. The surface ECG of 13 patients with lower-loop reentry was similar to that of their pattern during counterclockwise (CCW) CTI atrial flutter (AFL), except for decreased amplitude of the terminal forces in the inferior leads. In 11 of 24 episodes characterized by high or multiple breaks over the crista, the ECG showed changes that depended on the initial activation sequence of the LA. In 7 of 8 episodes of upper-loop reentry, the ECG pattern completely mimicked that for clockwise (CW) CTI AFL. All 11 patients with an LA septal circuit showed a typical ECG pattern characterized by prominent forces in lead V1 with flat deflections in the other surface leads. Eleven patients with other LA circuits had a more variable pattern but showed decreased voltage in the inferior leads compared with that of a group with CCW-CTI AFL (1.6+/-1 vs 2.68+/-0.7 mV, respectively; P<0.05).CONCLUSIONS: The RA surface-ECG patterns different from those of CCW or CW-CTI could still be CTI dependent. In contrast, a typical CW-CTI surface pattern was always seen in patients with upper-loop reentry, which was non-CTI dependent. LA AFL circuits had either flat or low-amplitude forces in the inferior leads.","['Aged', 'Atrial Flutter', 'Body Surface Potential Mapping', 'Catheter Ablation', 'Electrocardiography', 'Electrophysiologic Techniques, Cardiac', 'Female', 'Heart Atria', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",12835225,"[['M01.060.116.100'], ['C14.280.067.248', 'C23.550.073.248'], ['E01.370.370.380.240.850.100', 'E01.370.405.240.850.100'], ['E02.808.750.500', 'E04.014.760.500'], ['E01.370.370.380.240', 'E01.370.405.240'], ['E01.370.370.380.245', 'E01.370.405.267'], ['A07.541.358'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['E05.318.372.500.500.500', 'E05.318.372.500.750.750', 'N05.715.360.330.500.500.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.825', 'N06.850.520.450.500.500.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.825'], ['E05.318.370.800', 'E05.318.740.872', 'G17.800', 'N05.715.360.325.700', 'N05.715.360.750.725', 'N06.850.520.445.800', 'N06.850.520.830.872']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0

Dehydration propensity of order-disorder intermediate regions in soluble proteins.,"Soluble folded proteins maintain their structural integrity by properly shielding most backbone amides and carbonyls from full hydration. This structure ""wrapping"" entails a proper packing of the intramolecular hydrogen bonds. Thus, a poorly wrapped hydrogen bond constitutes an identifiable packing defect. Such defects are promoters of protein associations since they favor the removal of hydrating molecules. In this work we show that large clusters of packing defects generate the most significant dehydration hot spots on the protein surface, inducing a strong dielectric modulation that is reflected by a local quenching of the dielectric permittivity. The PDB-reported proteins with the largest clusters of packing defects are found to be three cancer-related transcription factors, four highly interactive proteins related to cell signaling and cytoskeleton, and a cellular prion protein. A large concentration of packing defects in a soluble protein constitutes a structural singularity that is intermediate between order and disorder. The functional implications of this singularity are investigated to delineate diverse interrelated roles. The presence of these large clusters signals a structural vulnerability, a pronounced dehydration propensity, and a strong electrostatic enhancement.","['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytoskeleton', 'Electrochemistry', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Bonding', 'Protein Conformation', 'Protein Folding', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Signal Transduction', 'Solubility', 'Solvents', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53', 'Water']",17672484,"[['B01.050'], ['A11.251.210.190', 'A11.251.860.180'], ['A11.284.430.214.190.750'], ['H01.181.529.307'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['G02.282'], ['G02.111.570.820.709'], ['G01.154.651', 'G02.111.688'], ['D12.776'], ['H01.158.201.843', 'H01.158.273.180.350.700', 'H01.158.273.343.350.700', 'H01.181.122.738'], ['G02.111.820', 'G04.835'], ['G02.805'], ['D27.720.844'], ['D12.776.157.687.650', 'D12.776.260.820', 'D12.776.624.776.775', 'D12.776.660.720.650', 'D12.776.744.845'], ['D01.045.250.875', 'D01.248.497.158.459.650', 'D01.650.550.925']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]']",1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
Ventricular arrhythmias in patients with myocardial infarction and ischaemia. Relationship to serum potassium and magnesium.,"Alterations in serum electrolytes may frequently accompany ischaemic heart disease. Many of these patients are hypertensive and receive diuretic therapy which results in chronic lowering of serum potassium and magnesium. In addition, acute catecholamine-induced shifts of potassium into cells may also occur in the setting of acute myocardial ischaemia. An association between low serum potassium concentrations and ventricular arrhythmias has been observed by a number of investigators in patients with acute myocardial infarction. The increased frequency of ventricular fibrillation with low serum potassium concentrations is particularly relevant as this arrhythmia is associated with poor prognosis, even in the setting of a coronary care unit. Ventricular fibrillation also occurs with increased frequency in patients with angina who have low serum potassium levels. The possibility that low serum potassium concentrations may be a risk factor in the increased incidence of sudden death in such patients should be considered. Diuretic-induced magnesium deficiency may be yet another factor favouring the emergence of ventricular arrhythmias in patients with ischaemic heart disease. While such electrolyte disturbances do not account for all of the ventricular irritability seen in patients with ischaemic heart disease, they represent easily identifiable and treatable risk factors. Primary prevention of these electrolyte disturbances in patients at risk for coronary ischaemia is recommended.","['Acute Disease', 'Angina Pectoris', 'Arrhythmias, Cardiac', 'Coronary Disease', 'Digitalis Glycosides', 'Humans', 'Magnesium', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Potassium']",6499704,"[['C23.550.291.125'], ['C14.280.647.187', 'C14.907.585.187', 'C23.888.592.612.233.500'], ['C14.280.067', 'C23.550.073'], ['C14.280.647.250', 'C14.907.585.250'], ['D04.210.500.155.580.130.500', 'D09.408.180.261'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D01.268.552.437', 'D01.268.557.500', 'D01.552.547.500'], ['C14.280.647.500', 'C14.907.585.500', 'C23.550.513.355.750', 'C23.550.717.489.750'], ['D01.268.549.550', 'D01.268.557.575', 'D01.552.528.652', 'D01.552.547.650']]","['Diseases [C]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]']",0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Biomass smoke COPD has less tomographic abnormalities but worse hypoxemia compared with tobacco COPD.,"Special attention has emerged towards biomass smoke-induced chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), providing new knowledge for prevention and therapeutic approach of non-smoker COPD patients. However, the understanding of biomass smoke COPD is still limited and somewhat controversial. The aim of the present study was to compare COPD exclusively caused by tobacco smoking with COPD exclusively caused by environmental or occupational exposures. For this cross-sectional study, COPD patients were recruited from outpatient clinics and formed two groups: non-smoker COPD group (n=16) with exposure to biomass smoke who did not smoke cigarette and tobacco smoker COPD group (n=15) with people who did not report biomass smoke exposure. Subjects underwent pulmonary function tests, thoracic high-resolution computed tomography, 6-min walk test, and sputum induction. The non-smoker COPD group had biomass smoke exposure of 133.3±86 hour-years. The tobacco COPD group smoked 48.5±27.4 pack-years. Women were 62.5 and 66.7%, respectively, of non-smokers and smokers. The non-smoker COPD group showed higher prevalence of dyspnea, lower arterial oxygen tension (PaO2), and lower arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2%) with similar spirometry results, lung volumes, and diffusion capacity. Regarding inflammatory biomarkers, differences were detected in sputum number of lymphomononuclear cells and in sputum concentrations of interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-8 with higher values in the smoker group. Emphysema was more prevalent in the tobacco smoker group, which also showed higher relative bronchial wall thickness and lower lung density by quantitative analysis. Biomass smoke induced more hypoxemia compared to tobacco in COPD patients with similar severity.","['Aged', 'Biomass', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hypoxia', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive', 'Respiratory Function Tests', 'Smoke', 'Spirometry', 'Sputum', 'Tobacco', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed']",31038579,"[['M01.060.116.100'], ['G16.500.275.157.100', 'N06.230.124.100'], ['E05.318.372.500.875', 'N05.715.360.330.500.875', 'N06.850.520.450.500.875'], ['N06.850.460.350'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C23.888.852.079'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['C08.381.495.389'], ['E01.370.386.700'], ['D20.633.937'], ['E01.370.386.700.750'], ['A12.200.808'], ['B01.650.940.800.575.912.250.908.500.900'], ['E01.370.350.350.810', 'E01.370.350.600.350.700.810', 'E01.370.350.700.700.810', 'E01.370.350.700.810.810', 'E01.370.350.825.810.810']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
Knowledge of correct condom use and consistency of use among adolescents in four countries in sub-Saharan Africa.,"Using data from the 2004 National Adolescent Surveys, this paper undertook a detail analysis of knowledge of correct condom use and consistency of use, as well as their covariates, among adolescents in Burkina Faso, Ghana, Malawi and Uganda. The strongest predictor of knowledge of correct condom use among both male and female adolescents is exposure to a condom use demonstration. In Burkina Faso, Ghana and Uganda, adolescents who have seen a condom demonstration are 2 to 5 times as likely as those who have not to have good knowledge of correct condom use. Age, ever received sex education in school, ever attended school and exposure to the radio are also significant predictors of knowledge of correct use, particularly among men. As indicated by behavior among young men, the extent to which adolescents use the condom consistently varies across countries. Yet, it is nowhere near the required 100% level. The proportion reporting consistent use of the method in the 3 months preceding the survey is 38% in Burkina Faso, 47% in Ghana, 20% in Malawi and 36% in Uganda. Age difference between partners is a major determinant of consistent use of condoms: young men whose partner is 0-4 years younger are about two and a half times more likely to use condoms consistently than those who whose partner is 5-9 years younger. Other important predictors of consistent condom use are residence, education, living arrangement and exposure to mass media, specifically the radio and newspaper. Findings from this study point to areas that policy and program can address to provide adolescents access to the kinds of information and service they need to achieve healthy sexual and reproductive lives.","['Adolescent', 'Adolescent Behavior', 'Africa South of the Sahara', 'Condoms', 'Contraceptive Devices, Male', 'Female', 'Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Sex Education', 'Sexual Behavior', 'Young Adult']",18458741,"[['M01.060.057'], ['F01.145.022'], ['Z01.058.290'], ['E07.190.270.150'], ['E07.190.270'], ['F01.100.150.500', 'N05.300.150.410'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['F04.096.837.500', 'I02.233.332.749'], ['F01.145.802'], ['M01.060.116.815']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Geographicals [Z]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]']",0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1
[Chest pain in acute myocardial infarction among diabetic and non-diabetic patients].,"Considering that diabetic patients suffering from Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI) may or may not have chest pain, this study aimed to compare the presence and intensity of chest pain in AMI between diabetic and non-diabetic patients. We conducted a cross-sectional study that included patients with AMI, aged ? 18 years, both sexes. We used a verbal numeric scale for assessing the presence and intensity of pain. The study included 88 patients, of whom 77 (87.5%) non-diabetic patients and 11 (12.5%) diabetics. The pain was present in 11 (100%) of diabetics and in 76 (98.7%) of non-diabetics. The intensity of pain in diabetics was 8.91 versus 8.23 in non-diabetic patients. The study showed similarity in the presence and intensity of chest pain between diabetic and non diabetic patients suffering from AMI.","['Chest Pain', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Diabetic Angiopathies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Prospective Studies', 'Severity of Illness Index']",22751712,"[['C23.888.592.612.233'], ['E05.318.372.500.875', 'N05.715.360.330.500.875', 'N06.850.520.450.500.875'], ['C14.907.320', 'C19.246.099.500'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['C14.280.647.500', 'C14.907.585.500', 'C23.550.513.355.750', 'C23.550.717.489.750'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.625', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.650', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.650'], ['E05.318.308.980.438.475.456.500', 'N05.715.360.300.800.438.375.364.500', 'N06.850.520.308.980.438.475.364.500']]","['Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Named Groups [M]']",0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
Chemical doping and electron-hole conduction asymmetry in graphene devices.,"We investigate poly(ethylene imine) and diazonium salts as stable, complementary dopants on graphene. Transport in graphene devices doped with these molecules exhibits asymmetry in electron and hole conductance. The conductance of one carrier is preserved, while the conductance of the other carrier decreases. Simulations based on nonequilibrium Green's function formalism suggest that the origin of this asymmetry is imbalanced carrier injection from the graphene electrodes caused by misalignment of the electrode and channel neutrality points.","['Computer Simulation', 'Crystallization', 'Electric Conductivity', 'Electron Transport', 'Graphite', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Materials Testing', 'Models, Chemical', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Nanostructures', 'Nanotechnology', 'Particle Size', 'Surface Properties']",19102701,"[['L01.224.160'], ['E05.196.300', 'G02.171'], ['G01.358.500.249.277'], ['G02.111.248', 'G03.295.531.403', 'G03.493.350'], ['D01.268.150.300', 'D01.578.300'], ['D05'], ['E05.570'], ['E05.599.495'], ['G02.111.570.820'], ['J01.637.512'], ['H01.603', 'J01.897.520.600'], ['G02.712'], ['G02.860']]","['Information Science [L]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Technology, Industry, and Agriculture [J]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]']",0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0
Accuracy of levelling intraventricular collection drainage systems.,"In neuroscience critical care units, patients may have ventricular drains placed to aid management of acutely elevated intracranial pressure from a variety of causes. Correct placement of the ventricular drainage collection system, a nursing responsibility, is key to the process, and has the potential to influence patient outcome. A two-part study investigated the accuracy with which registered nurses levelled a ventricular drainage collection system. Part 1 found that nurses (N = 33) were unable to accurately level using visual means only. Part 2 found that nurses' (N = 31) use of a tool (a carpenter's level or a newly developed laser levelling device) dramatically improved accuracy. However, demographic differences between nurses in Part 1 and Part 2 may have contributed to this outcome. While both tools were accurate, the laser levelling device was superior to the carpenter's level for speed of use, nurses' rating of ease of use and patient safety.","['Catheters, Indwelling', 'Critical Care', 'Drainage', 'Gravitation', 'Humans', 'Intracranial Hypertension', 'Monitoring, Physiologic', 'Ventricular Pressure', 'Ventriculostomy']",9307930,"[['E07.132.500'], ['E02.760.190', 'N02.421.585.190'], ['E02.309', 'E04.237'], ['G01.060.350'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C10.228.140.631'], ['E01.370.520'], ['G09.330.380.937', 'G09.330.955.950'], ['E04.035.188.957', 'E04.525.170.860']]","['Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]']",0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
Temporal dynamics of sequential motor activation in a dual-prime paradigm: Insights from conditional accuracy and hazard functions.,"In response priming experiments, a participant has to respond as quickly and as accurately as possible to a target stimulus preceded by a prime. The prime and the target can either be mapped to the same response (consistent trial) or to different responses (inconsistent trial). Here, we investigate the effects of two sequential primes (each one either consistent or inconsistent) followed by one target in a response priming experiment. We employ discrete-time hazard functions of response occurrence and conditional accuracy functions to explore the temporal dynamics of sequential motor activation. In two experiments (small-N design, 12 participants, 100 trials per cell and subject), we find that (1) the earliest responses are controlled exclusively by the first prime if primes are presented in quick succession, (2) intermediate responses reflect competition between primes, with the second prime increasingly dominating the response as its time of onset is moved forward, and (3) only the slowest responses are clearly controlled by the target. The current study provides evidence that sequential primes meet strict criteria for sequential response activation. Moreover, it suggests that primes can influence responses out of a memory buffer when they are presented so early that participants are forced to delay their responses.","['Humans', 'Motor Activity', 'Perceptual Masking', 'Problem Solving', 'Reaction Time']",32166642,"[['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['F01.145.632', 'G11.427.410.698'], ['F02.463.593.071.594', 'F02.463.593.932.733', 'G07.888.125.594'], ['F02.463.425.725', 'F02.463.785.810'], ['E05.796.817', 'F02.830.650', 'F04.669.817', 'G11.561.677']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Treatment of distal radius fractures with a low-profile dorsal plating system: an outcomes assessment.,"PURPOSE: To evaluate objective functional and radiographic outcomes after internal fixation of acute, displaced, and unstable fractures of the distal aspect of the radius in adults by using a low-profile dorsal plating system. Our hypothesis was that the low-profile dorsal plating system would allow for a reduction of extensor tendon irritation and pain and provide stable osseous fixation.METHODS: Sixty consecutive unstable fractures in 59 patients were treated by open reduction internal fixation using a low-profile dorsal plating system. There were 29 type A, 14 type B, and 8 type C fractures (AO classification system). Fifty patients with 51 fractures returned for outcomes assessment by physical examination, plain radiographs, and completion of a validated musculoskeletal function assessment questionnaire. The minimum follow-up period was 1 year; the mean follow-up period was 24 months. Clinical evaluation was performed and plain radiographs were assessed for maintenance of immediate postoperative reduction and implant position. Objective functional assessment was obtained through the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand questionnaire.RESULTS: Outcomes analysis showed no cases of extensor tendon irritation or rupture. Hardware removal was performed in 1 patient but no extensor tendon irritation or rupture was evidenced. The mean Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand score was 11.9; implant-related discomfort was minimal. All patients had an excellent (31 patients) or good (19 patients) result according to the scoring system of Gartland and Werley. The mean active range of motion was greater than 80% of that of the contralateral wrist in flexion/extension, pronation/supination, and ulnar/radial deviation. Extensor tendon function was unimpaired in all patients. Grip and pinch strength averaged 90% and 94% of the contralateral sides, respectively. Radiographic evaluation showed no change in fracture reduction or implant position.CONCLUSIONS: The treatment of distal radius fractures with a low-profile stainless steel dorsal plating system is a safe and effective method that provides stable internal fixation and allows for full extensor tendon glide and full metacarpophalangeal joint motion. Objective outcome testing showed uniformly good to excellent recovery of wrist and hand function in all patients.TYPE OF STUDY/LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic, Level IV.","['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Bone Plates', 'Cohort Studies', 'Disability Evaluation', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Fracture Fixation, Internal', 'Hand Strength', 'Humans', 'Joint Instability', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pronation', 'Prosthesis Design', 'Radiography', 'Radius Fractures', 'Range of Motion, Articular', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Supination', 'Wrist Joint']",16516731,"[['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['M01.060.116.100.080'], ['E07.695.370.374', 'E07.858.442.660.460.374', 'E07.858.690.725.460.374'], ['E05.318.372.500.750', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750'], ['E01.370.400'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.249', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.350', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.350'], ['E04.555.300.300'], ['E01.370.600.425.500', 'G11.427.560.500'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C05.550.521'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['G11.427.410.698.840'], ['E05.320.550', 'E07.695.680'], ['E01.370.350.700'], ['C26.088.268.556', 'C26.404.562'], ['E01.370.600.700', 'G11.427.760'], ['E05.318.372.500.500.500', 'E05.318.372.500.750.750', 'N05.715.360.330.500.500.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.825', 'N06.850.520.450.500.500.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.825'], ['G11.427.410.698.920'], ['A02.835.583.405.930']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
Predictive factors of the duration of a first-attack acute urticaria in children.,"PURPOSES: This study's aim was to determine the predictive factors of the duration of first-attack acute urticaria in children.BASIC PROCEDURES: The sample included 1075 children admitted to the emergency department with first-attack acute urticaria. Variables comprising the clinical features and past histories of children with duration of disease of 3 days or less, 4 to 7 days, 8 to 14 days, and 15 days or more were compared to determine the predictors of duration of acute urticaria.MAIN FINDINGS: Age, various etiologies, clinical presentations, coexistent pyrexia or angioedema, and personal histories of allergic diseases were significant factors (all P < .05). Among allergic diseases, atopic dermatitis was the most significant predictor of duration of acute urticaria, and those with multiple allergic diseases had longer durations of urticaria (both P < .05). Oral plus injection forms of antihistamine or steroid were related to shorter duration of disease (P < .05).PRINCIPAL CONCLUSIONS: Etiologies and personal allergy history may be the most important predictors of the duration of a first attack of acute urticaria.","['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Age Factors', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Chi-Square Distribution', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Dermatitis, Atopic', 'Emergency Service, Hospital', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Time Factors', 'Urticaria']",20627220,"[['C23.550.291.125'], ['M01.060.057'], ['N05.715.350.075', 'N06.850.490.250'], ['E05.318.740.150', 'N05.715.360.750.125', 'N06.850.520.830.150'], ['E05.318.740.994.300', 'G17.820.300', 'N05.715.360.750.750.200', 'N06.850.520.830.994.300'], ['M01.060.406'], ['M01.060.406.448'], ['C16.320.850.210', 'C17.800.174.193', 'C17.800.815.193', 'C17.800.827.210', 'C20.543.480.343'], ['N02.278.216.500.968.336', 'N02.421.297.195', 'N04.452.442.452.422.336'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['C20.543'], ['M01.060.703'], ['G01.910.857'], ['C17.800.862.945', 'C20.543.480.904']]","['Diseases [C]', 'Named Groups [M]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]']",0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
Doctor's order: an early modern doctor's alchemical notebooks.,"This is a case study on a series of at least thirty-four sixteenth-century notebooks from the Sloane collection, which reconsiders early modern notetaking techniques and the organisation of knowledge. These notebooks were written by an anonymous compiler, a physician who read widely in the alchemical and medical literature available in his lifetime, the late sixteenth century. In the alchemica, he devotes individual volumes to specific alchemical substances, which are connected with each other by means of a complex system of cross-referencing; they are constantly revised and change appearance according to the physician's latest ideas about alchemical medicines. As a result, the notebooks not only preserve received information (a task otherwise performed by commonplace books in this period)--they also represent an equivalent to the alchemical workshop, where the combination of different textual elements generates knowledge.","['Alchemy', 'History, 16th Century', 'Manuscripts, Medical as Topic']",18548902,"[['K01.672.148'], ['K01.400.475.750'], ['L01.178.682.608.526']]","['Humanities [K]', 'Information Science [L]']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
Column selection and method development for the determination of the enantiomeric purity of investigational non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors.,"DPC 961 and DPC 083 are investigational non-nucleoside reversed transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI) being evaluated for the treatment of HIV infections (Corbett et al., Antimicrob Agents Chemother 1999;43:2893-2897). Both compounds are chiral and are synthesized as single enantiomers by an asymmetric synthetic pathway (Magnus et al., Tetrahedron Lett 2000;41:3015-3019). A chiral method was developed to control the enantiomeric purity of the drug substance and to monitor for any chiral inversion in the drug substance and in the tablet formulation during stability studies. Three columns were evaluated: Chiralpak AD, Chirobiotic V, and Whelk-O. All three columns have broad applicability and can resolve enantiomers of compounds of very diverse molecular structure and polarity. The three columns were evaluated with various mobile phase compositions for their ability to resolve the racemic mixtures of DPC 083, DPC 961, and their respective enantiomers and for their selectivity toward the synthetic impurities of the two drug substances. Nonaqueous mobile phases were selected because the two drugs are poorly water soluble. The separation between the unwanted enantiomer of DPC 083 and DPC 961, which is a major impurity of DPC 083, in particular, was closely monitored. The final method was fully validated and is used for the routine testing of the drug substance and tablets.","['Anti-HIV Agents', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'HIV Infections', 'Humans', 'Quinazolines', 'Quinazolinones', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors', 'Stereoisomerism']",11284024,"[['D27.505.954.122.388.077.088'], ['E05.196.181.400.300'], ['C01.221.250.875', 'C01.221.812.640.400', 'C01.778.640.400', 'C01.925.782.815.616.400', 'C01.925.813.400', 'C20.673.480'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D03.633.100.786'], ['D03.633.100.786.830'], ['E05.318.370.725', 'E05.337.851', 'N05.715.360.325.685', 'N06.850.520.445.725'], ['D27.505.519.389.675.850', 'D27.505.954.122.388.308'], ['G02.607.445.682']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
Developmentally regulated rat brain mRNAs: molecular and anatomical characterization.,"In order to identify markers for developing neural cell populations and gain molecular insights into the processes of neural development and differentiation, we have selected cDNA clones of rat brain mRNAs that are expressed in brain at embryonic day 16 (E16) with at least 10-fold greater abundance than they are in adult brain. Eleven such clones were obtained from a cDNA library of E16 brain poly(A)+ RNA using a combination of differential and subtractive hybridization screens. The temporal and spatial patterns of expression of the mRNAs corresponding to these clones were characterized by Northern (RNA) blotting and by in situ hybridization. Although all the mRNAs were enriched in embryonic brain, different mRNAs demonstrated maximum abundance at different times in late embryogenesis. The mRNAs can be grouped into 3 classes on the basis of their patterns of spatial expression in the embryo: one cDNA clone from each class and its corresponding mRNAs have been characterized in more detail. Class C represents mRNAs that are highly enriched in the nervous system and may be expressed in newly differentiating neurons; the example chosen was shown by nucleotide sequence analysis to encode the brain alpha 1 isotype of tubulin. Class B mRNAs have a broader distribution in the developing embryo but are expressed predominantly in the ventricular germinal zones of the developing nervous system and may represent molecules involved with neurogenesis. A third class (Class A) includes mRNAs with a more homogeneous distribution within the embryo and developing nervous system, which may encode ""housekeeping"" molecules. These clones and their encoded products will provide markers for cell populations at particular stages of neural development.","['Animals', 'Brain', 'DNA', 'Electrophoresis, Agar Gel', 'Immunologic Techniques', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'Poly A', 'RNA', 'RNA, Messenger', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred Strains']",2441010,"[['B01.050'], ['A08.186.211'], ['D13.444.308'], ['E05.196.401.153', 'E05.301.300.100'], ['E05.478'], ['E05.393.661', 'G02.111.611'], ['D13.695.578.550.500'], ['D13.444.735'], ['D13.444.735.544'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700'], ['B01.050.050.199.520.760', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700.400']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Long-term follow-up after exertional heat illness during recruit training.,"PURPOSE: To evaluate long-term susceptibility to subsequent serious exertional heat illness (EHI) in military recruits who suffered exertional heat illness during basic training.METHODS: We identified Marine Corps members who completed at least 6 months of military service and suffered EHI treated as outpatients (N = 872) or inpatients (N = 50) during basic training in 1979-1991 at the Parris Island Marine Corps Recruit Depot, SC (EHI cases). We compared them to 1391 similar members (noncases) who did not experience EHI during basic training. These subjects were followed from 6 months after accession into the military through the subsequent 4 yr. Follow-up was through military personnel records to determine retention and military hospital databases to determine subsequent hospitalizations during military service.RESULTS: Military retention rates were slightly lower for those who suffered EHI during basic training, compared with those who did not (24% vs 30% at 4 yr, respectively). Outpatient EHI cases also had about 40% higher subsequent hospitalization rates in military hospitals than noncases during their continued military service, although these differences declined over time and diagnoses showed little relationship to EHI. EHI cases had higher rates of subsequent hospitalization for EHI, but the number was too small (five hospitalizations) to provide stable comparisons.CONCLUSION: Hospitalization for EHI is uncommon during subsequent military service after an initial episode during basic training, and occurrence of EHI during basic training has only a small impact on subsequent military retention and hospitalization.","['Adult', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Exercise', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Heat Stress Disorders', 'Hospitalization', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Military Personnel', 'Risk Factors']",11528330,"[['M01.060.116'], ['E05.318.372.500.500', 'N05.715.360.330.500.500', 'N06.850.520.450.500.500'], ['G11.427.410.698.277', 'I03.350'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.249', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.350', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.350'], ['C26.522'], ['E02.760.400', 'N02.421.585.400'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['M01.526.625'], ['E05.318.740.600.800.725', 'N05.715.350.200.700', 'N05.715.360.750.625.700.700', 'N06.850.490.625.750', 'N06.850.520.830.600.800.725']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Organisms [B]']",0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0
Long-term economic outcomes associated with intensive versus moderate lipid-lowering therapy in coronary artery disease: results from the Treating to New Targets (TNT) Trial.,"BACKGROUND: In 10,001 patients with stable coronary artery disease (CAD) enrolled in the Treating to New Targets (TNT) trial, 80 mg/d of atorvastatin (high-dose regimen) reduced the composite primary end point of death from CAD, nonfatal myocardial infarction, resuscitation from cardiac arrest, or stroke by 22% relative to 10 mg/d (low-dose regimen).METHODS: We performed an economic analysis of this trial from the US perspective using hospital bills and Medicare physician fees to estimate costs for cardiovascular hospitalizations in all US patients (n = 5,308). Atorvastatin costs were assigned using a discounted average wholesale price. Cost-effectiveness was calculated as the within-trial incremental cost required to prevent one primary end point event with high-dose atorvastatin.RESULTS: During a mean 4.9-year follow-up, the high-dose arm had fewer potential end point cardiovascular hospitalizations (35% vs 41%, P < .001) and revascularization procedures (16% vs 22%, P < .001). The high-dose regimen was $1 per day more expensive. At the end of 5 years, cumulative incremental cost for the high-dose arm was $252 (95% CI-$722 to +$1,276). With an absolute reduction in the primary end point of 2.8 per 100 treated with the high-dose regimen, the cost to prevent one additional primary end point event was $8,964.CONCLUSION: High-dose atorvastatin treatment of 5 years had only a small net incremental cost because of reduced complications and procedures. The cost to prevent one additional primary end point event with high-dose therapy was similar to that for drug-eluting stents versus bare metal stents in stable CAD and for early invasive versus early conservative therapy in acute coronary syndromes.","['Aged', 'Atorvastatin', 'Coronary Artery Disease', 'Female', 'Heptanoic Acids', 'Hospital Costs', 'Hospitalization', 'Humans', 'Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors', 'Male', 'Medicare', 'Middle Aged', 'Myocardial Revascularization', 'Outcome Assessment, Health Care', 'Prospective Studies', 'Pyrroles', 'United States']",18926150,"[['M01.060.116.100'], ['D03.383.129.578.075', 'D10.251.450.200'], ['C14.280.647.250.260', 'C14.907.137.126.339', 'C14.907.585.250.260'], ['D10.251.450'], ['N03.219.151.400.687', 'N03.219.262.500', 'N05.300.375.500'], ['E02.760.400', 'N02.421.585.400'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['D27.505.519.186.071.202.370', 'D27.505.519.389.370', 'D27.505.954.557.500.202.370'], ['N03.219.521.346.506.564.663', 'N03.219.521.576.343.840', 'N03.706.615.696'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['E04.100.376.719', 'E04.928.220.520'], ['H01.770.644.145.431', 'N04.761.559.590', 'N05.715.360.575.575'], ['E05.318.372.500.750.625', 'N05.715.360.330.500.750.650', 'N06.850.520.450.500.750.650'], ['D03.383.129.578'], ['Z01.107.567.875']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Disciplines and Occupations [H]', 'Geographicals [Z]']",0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1
Neuronal calcium activates a Rap1 and B-Raf signaling pathway via the cyclic adenosine monophosphate-dependent protein kinase.,"Activity-dependent regulation of neuronal events such as cell survival and synaptic plasticity is controlled by increases in neuronal calcium levels. These actions often involve stimulation of intracellular kinase signaling pathways. For example, the mitogen-activated protein kinase, or extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), signaling cascade has increasingly been shown to be important for the induction of gene expression and long term potentiation. However, the mechanisms leading to ERK activation by neuronal calcium are still unclear. In the present study, we describe a protein kinase A (PKA)-dependent signaling pathway that may link neuronal calcium influx to ERKs via the small G-protein, Rap1, and the neuronal Raf isoform, B-Raf. Thus, in PC12 cells, depolarization-mediated calcium influx led to the activation of B-Raf, but not Raf-1, via PKA. Furthermore, depolarization also induced the PKA-dependent stimulation of Rap1 and led to the formation of a Rap1/B-Raf signaling complex. In contrast, depolarization did not lead to the association of Ras with B-Raf. The major action of PKA-dependent Rap1/B-Raf signaling in neuronal cells is the activation of ERKs. Thus, we further show that, in both PC12 cells and hippocampal neurons, depolarization-induced calcium influx stimulates ERK activity in a PKA-dependent manner. Given the fact that both Rap1 and B-Raf are highly expressed in the central nervous system, we suggest that this signaling pathway may regulate a number of activity-dependent neuronal functions.","['Animals', 'Calcium', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System', 'Membrane Potentials', 'Neurons', 'PC12 Cells', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-raf', 'Rats', 'Signal Transduction', 'rap1 GTP-Binding Proteins']",10652372,"[['B01.050'], ['D01.268.552.100', 'D01.552.539.288', 'D23.119.100'], ['G02.111.820.560', 'G03.493.560', 'G04.835.560'], ['G01.154.535', 'G04.580', 'G07.265.675', 'G11.561.570'], ['A08.675', 'A11.671'], ['A11.251.210.190.750', 'A11.251.860.180.750', 'A11.299.500'], ['D08.811.913.696.620.682.700.559.842.500', 'D12.644.360.400.842.500', 'D12.776.476.400.842.500', 'D12.776.624.664.700.204.500'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700'], ['G02.111.820', 'G04.835'], ['D08.811.277.040.330.300.400.475.100', 'D12.644.360.525.475.100', 'D12.776.157.325.515.475.100', 'D12.776.476.525.475.100']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Suicidal Behavior in Adolescents: A Latent Class Analysis.,": The main goal of the present study was to identify and validate latent classes of suicidal behavior in a representative sample of adolescents. The sample comprised a total of 1506 students, including 667 males (44.3%), selected through a sample stratified by clusters. The mean age was 16.15 years (SD = 1.36). The instruments used evaluated suicidal behavior, positive and negative affect, emotional and behavioral problems, prosocial behavior, and subjective well-being. Using the Paykel Suicide Scale, the latent class analysis identified four homogeneous subgroups: ""low risk"", ""suicidal act"", ""suicidal ideation"", and ""high risk for suicide"". These subgroups presented a differential pattern in terms of their social-emotional adjustment. The subgroups with the highest theoretical risk showed lower scores on subjective well-being and positive affect as well as higher scores on emotional and behavioral problems and negative affect compared to the non-risk subgroups. This study contributes to an understanding of the typologies of suicidal behavior among adolescents and the relationship with psychopathological adjustment. Ultimately, these findings may promote the development or improvement of early detection and prevention strategies in the suicidal behavior field in order to reduce the socio-economic burdens associated with suicide in young populations.","['Adolescent', 'Adolescent Behavior', 'Emotions', 'Humans', 'Latent Class Analysis', 'Male', 'Risk Factors', 'Suicidal Ideation', 'Suicide', 'Suicide, Attempted']",32325865,"[['M01.060.057'], ['F01.145.022'], ['F01.470'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['E05.318.740.250.338', 'G17.035.625', 'L01.224.050.687', 'N05.715.360.750.200.375', 'N06.850.520.830.250.338'], ['E05.318.740.600.800.725', 'N05.715.350.200.700', 'N05.715.360.750.625.700.700', 'N06.850.490.625.750', 'N06.850.520.830.600.800.725'], ['F01.145.126.980.875.149', 'I01.880.735.856.149'], ['F01.145.126.980.875', 'I01.880.735.856'], ['F01.145.126.980.875.600', 'I01.880.735.856.600']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Psychiatry and Psychology [F]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Information Science [L]', 'Health Care [N]', 'Anthropology, Education, Sociology, and Social Phenomena [I]']",0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,0
Focal and perifocal changes in tissue energy state during middle cerebral artery occlusion in normo- and hyperglycemic rats.,"The objective of the present study was to assess changes in cellular energy metabolism in focal and perifocal areas of a stroke lesion and to explore how these changes are modulated by preischemic hyperglycemia. A model for reversible occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) in rats was used to study changes in energy metabolism. Following MCA occlusion for 5, 15, or 30 min in normoglycemic rats, the tissue was frozen in situ, and samples from the lateral caudoputamen and from two neocortical areas were collected for metabolite analyses, together with a control sample from the contralateral, nonischemic hemisphere. Two other groups, subjected to 30 min of MCA occlusion, were made hyperglycemic by acute glucose infusion or by prior injection of streptozotocin. Enzymatic techniques were used for measurements of phosphocreatine, creatine, ATP, ADP, AMP, glycogen, glucose, pyruvate, and lactate. The neocortex of the contralateral, nonischemic hemisphere had labile metabolites that were similar to those measured in control animals. Ipsilateral neocortex bordering the focus, and thus constituting the ""penumbra,"" showed mild to moderate ischemic changes. In the ""focus"" (lateral caudoputamen plus the overlying neocortex), deterioration of energy state was rapid and relatively extensive (ATP content 20-40% of control). After 5 min of occlusion, no further deterioration of metabolic parameters was observed. Substrate levels were markedly reduced, and lactate content rose to approximately 10 mM kg-1.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Adenine Nucleotides', 'Animals', 'Arterial Occlusive Diseases', 'Blood Pressure', 'Body Temperature', 'Brain', 'Diabetes Mellitus, Experimental', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Glucose', 'Hyperglycemia', 'Lactates', 'Lactic Acid', 'Male', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred Strains']",1727140,"[['D03.633.100.759.646.138', 'D13.695.667.138', 'D13.695.827.068'], ['B01.050'], ['C14.907.137'], ['E01.370.600.875.249', 'G09.330.380.076'], ['E01.370.600.875.374', 'G07.110'], ['A08.186.211'], ['C18.452.394.750.074', 'C19.246.240', 'E05.598.500.374'], ['G03.295'], ['D09.947.875.359.448'], ['C18.452.394.952'], ['D02.241.511.459'], ['D02.241.511.459.450'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700'], ['B01.050.050.199.520.760', 'B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.700.400']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Anatomy [A]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Characterization of multiple forms of carbonyl reductase from chicken liver.,"Three enzyme forms (CR1, CR2 and CR3) of carbonyl reductase were purified from chicken liver with using 4-benzoylpyridine as a substrate. CR1 was a dimeric enzyme composed of two identical 25-kD subunits. CR2 and CR3 were monomeric enzymes whose molecular weights were both 32 kD. CR1 exhibited 17 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase activity as well as carbonyl reductase activity in the presence of both NADP(H) and NAD(H). CR2 and CR3 had similar properties with regard to substrate specificity and inhibitor sensitivity. They could exhibit the activity only with NADPH and had no hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase activity. CR2 and CR3 cross-reacted with anti-chicken kidney carbonyl reductase antibody, though CR1 did not. The results suggest that CR1 is a hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, and CR2 and CR3 are similar to each other and to the kidney enzymes.","['17-Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenases', 'Alcohol Oxidoreductases', 'Animals', 'Blotting, Western', 'Chickens', 'Chromatography, Affinity', 'Chromatography, Gel', 'Cytosol', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Isoenzymes', 'Kinetics', 'Liver', 'Molecular Weight', 'Substrate Specificity']",1338044,"[['D08.811.682.047.436.375'], ['D08.811.682.047'], ['B01.050'], ['E05.196.401.143', 'E05.301.300.096', 'E05.478.566.320.200', 'E05.601.262', 'E05.601.470.320.200'], ['B01.050.150.900.248.350.150', 'B01.050.150.900.248.690.192'], ['E05.196.181.400.170'], ['E05.196.181.400.250'], ['A11.284.430.214.200', 'A11.284.430.429.200', 'A11.284.835.450.200'], ['E05.196.401.402', 'E05.301.300.319'], ['D08.811.348', 'D12.776.800.300'], ['G01.374.661', 'G02.111.490'], ['A03.620'], ['G02.494'], ['G02.111.835']]","['Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]']",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Emergence of integron borne PER-1 mediated extended spectrum cephalosporin resistance among nosocomial isolates of Gram-negative bacilli.,"BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Pseudomonas extended resistant (PER) enzymes are rare type of extended-spectrum beta lactamases (ESBLs) that confer third generation cephalosporin resistance. These are often integron borne and laterally transmitted. The aim of the present study was to investigate the emergence of integron borne cephalosporin resistant PER-1 gene in diverse incompatibility (Inc) group plasmids among Gram-negative bacteria.METHODS: A total of 613 consecutive, non-duplicate, Gram-negative bacteria of Enterobacteriaceae family and non-fermenting Gram-negative bacteria were isolated from different clinical specimens during a period of 18 months. For amplification and detection of blaPER, multiplex PCR was done. For understanding the genetic environment of blaPER-1, integrase gene PCR and cassette PCR (59 be) was performed. Gene transferability experiment was carried out and PCR based replicon typing was performed for incompatibility group typing of plasmids using 18 pairs of primers. An inhibitor based method was used for phenotypic detection of intrinsic resistance.RESULTS: Multiplex PCR and sequencing confirmed that 45 isolates were harbouring blaPER-1. Both class 1 and class 2 integrons were observed among them. Integrase and cassette PCR (59 be) PCR results confirmed that the resistant determinant was located within class 1 integron. Transformation and conjugation experiments revealed that PER-1 was laterally transferable and disseminated through diverse Inc plasmid type. Efflux pump mediated carbapenem resistance was observed in all isolates. All isolates belonged to heterogenous groups.INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the dissemination of cephalosporins resistant, integron borne blaPER-1 in hospital setting in this part of the country and emphasizes on the rational use of third generation cephalosporins to slow down the expansion of this rare type of ESBL gene.","['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Bacterial Proteins', 'Cephalosporins', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Drug Resistance, Bacterial', 'Escherichia coli', 'Female', 'Humans', 'India', 'Infant', 'Integrons', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Plasmids', 'Pseudomonas aeruginosa', 'beta-Lactamases']",26205025,"[['M01.060.057'], ['M01.060.116'], ['M01.060.116.100'], ['D12.776.097'], ['D02.065.589.099.249', 'D02.886.665.074', 'D03.633.100.300.249'], ['M01.060.406'], ['M01.060.406.448'], ['G06.099.225', 'G06.225.347', 'G07.690.773.984.269.347'], ['B03.440.450.425.325.300', 'B03.660.250.150.180.100'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.988.400.112.400.400'], ['Z01.252.245.393'], ['M01.060.703'], ['G02.111.570.080.708.330.200.500'], ['M01.060.116.630'], ['G05.360.600'], ['B03.440.400.425.625.625.100', 'B03.660.250.580.590.050'], ['D08.811.277.087.180']]","['Named Groups [M]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Organisms [B]', 'Geographicals [Z]']",0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1
Defective signal transduction in CD4-CD8- T cells of lpr mice.,"Mice homozygous for the lpr gene develop a lymphoproliferative disorder due to expansion of a subset of CD4-CD8- T cells. Triggering of the T-cell receptor in these lpr T cells does not lead to translocation of protein kinase C or phosphorylation of CD3, interleukin-2 production, or proliferation, whereas a combination of phorbol ester and calcium ionophore does. Stimulation with concanavalin A or anti-CD3 induces phosphoinositide hydrolysis. The rise in inositol bisphosphate, inositol triphosphate, and inositol tetrakisphosphate, identified by HPLC, is similar in +/+ and lpr T cells. The concentration of cytoplasmic free calcium ([Ca2+]i), however, under basal and stimulated conditions is significantly lower in lpr T cells. The lower basal [Ca2+]i may explain why induction of proliferation with phorbol ester and calcium ionophore requires a higher concentration of ionophore in these cells than in normal T cells. The lower [Ca2+]i obtained on stimulation may contribute to the activation defect of CD4-CD8- lpr T cells.","['Animals', 'Antigens, Differentiation', 'Calcium', 'Concanavalin A', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Inositol Phosphates', 'Lupus Erythematosus, Systemic', 'Lymph Nodes', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Mice', 'Mice, Mutant Strains', 'Phosphatidylinositols', 'T-Lymphocytes']",2551509,"[['B01.050'], ['D23.050.301.264', 'D23.101.100'], ['D01.268.552.100', 'D01.552.539.288', 'D23.119.100'], ['D12.776.503.499.500', 'D12.776.765.678.500'], ['G07.690.773.875', 'G07.690.936.500'], ['D02.033.800.519.400', 'D09.853.519.400', 'D09.894.480'], ['C17.300.480', 'C20.111.590'], ['A10.549.400', 'A15.382.520.604.412'], ['E01.370.225.812.482', 'E05.200.812.482', 'E05.478.594.530', 'G12.450.050.400.545', 'G12.565'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500'], ['B01.050.150.900.649.313.992.635.505.500.550'], ['D10.570.755.375.760.400.942'], ['A11.118.637.555.567.569', 'A15.145.229.637.555.567.569', 'A15.382.490.555.567.569']]","['Organisms [B]', 'Chemicals and Drugs [D]', 'Phenomena and Processes [G]', 'Diseases [C]', 'Anatomy [A]', 'Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]']",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
